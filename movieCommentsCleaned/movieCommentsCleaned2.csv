The family&#39;s reaction isn&#39;t the whole point of the movie, it isn&#39;t the pivotal moment you should be waiting for or curious about, the whole movie is about Wakefield&#39;s arc, as well as the ending. The family&#39;s reaction will only just be a mere consequence of his choice, they could hate him for trying to selfishly find meaning in his own life, or they could embrace him, empathize with him as he&#39;s struggling to find meaning in his own life. I believe he would&#39;ve committed suicide had he not left his &quot;life&quot; in search of his own meaning of life. Would you rather see Wakefield committing suicide early on, and left his family alone forever because he failed to see the joy he would later find in his family and in his life after he had distant himself from his family? Remember, he always had the choice of not returning, but he chose to return to his family.

2519,GQR5zsLHbYw,"I have been doing a little research project this month. I have had extra time as compared to a normal human being who works. And so to kill time, I have been going to a lot of movies. I have been going to an inordinate amount of movies, more movies than an average human being. Naturally, the first thing I did was watch the movies I really wanted to see based on the previews that I had witnessed. I saw Deadpool which I thought was amazing, then I went to see Zootopia, which was the best movie of the year so far. But, then I started watching movies I wouldn&#39;t normally go see. I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane, which was just ok, and then I saw Risen, which I had mistaken for a movie about Roman soldiers. I was right but also very wrong and the movie wasn&#39;t that good anyways. I also saw a movie with one of my favorite actors, George Clooney, however that movie ended up being HIS worst. Then I got really bored and went to see movies I didn&#39;t even want to see.   I went to see The Witch, which was bad, and finally dragged myself into the atrocity of a film The Divergent Series: Allegiant, which made me surprised, because I hadn&#39;t killed myself before its credits.<br><br>My science experiment was that I made a mental note of the feeling the picture gave me just from the previews. The experiment proved that the preview is a very good indicator on whether a movie is going to be good or bad.  I raved about the preview for Deadpool and Zootopia which turned out to be fantastic, and turned my nose up for The Divergent Series: Allegiant which turned out to be a disaster. I had a similar spectrum of feelings for all the movies in the middle. I did not go see The Gods of Egypt. That movie preview was so bad, I decided that I would rather sit in a dark room and listen to grass grow. As it turns out the people who made that film are either fired, broke or both. Maybe they should pick up my hobby.<br><br>My point is that The Nice Guys  has got my attention. The preview has made me get the inkling that I am really going to enjoy it. Is it the aging Crowe or the young rising Gosling? Maybe it is the setting or the plot, or a combination of the two? I don&#39;t know why I am going to enjoy The Nice Guys, but I would be willing to put money down that I will love it.  I think that a lot of people will agree with me that WB has got this trailer right, and so the movie must be right as well. <br><br>I have never seen so many movies in a short amount of time. I pity you people over in Hollywood. I once thought there was great glamour in the movie business. However the reality of it is that there is a lot of junk to sift through. I am happy that the previews allows us to avoid movies that aren&#39;t worth a 2D matinee. I also want to thank the industry for making that fact blatantly obvious. <br><br>We will see how my nose fairs for the next month. So far I have smelled a stinky ghost, shook my head at a mothers day movie that smells like an old &quot;friends&quot; sock, and wondered why Tommy Lee Jones is suddenly mute.<br><br>Time will tell Youtube...

Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t spoil the movie and you know what happens in this twist ending? The film explains about a user who was selected from the Internet and he goes on a field trip to the unknown area where the mountains at. He meets a strange scientist who lives in his secret place and he explains the our main character that the area is the research of artificial intelligence of making robots come to alive. Then, he meets a gorgeous robotic woman who stays inside the room and the scientist wants him to be part of his research to communicate with the robot. He spends time with the robotic girl for few days until the room shuts down and the girl tells the truth that the scientist is a bad person who kept his secret between the robot and him. He tries to convince the scientist, but our main character was stuck in the research facility that he wishes to release the girl that he wants. What will happen that you trust with the robot that she turns just like human can do? Does he trust the robot that he cares or the robot is the one who behind all this? All the answers can figure it out unless you want the our main character to be saved. It&#39;s visually stunning that takes place in the strange area that makes you chill while you watch it and our main hero was shock and tense that he is in the strange room that makes it darker and scary. The two actors are great including our main hero is questionable and skeptical about the area and the scientist is unlikable, but he keeps it secret that he&#39;s a humble guy that you don&#39;t mess around with him. Eva was great and one of the best robotic characters ever with beautifully design of herself and the actress was great to become a robot who spends her whole time that she wants to be him or out. The direction is great with wonderful script, nicely cinematography, and great sci-fi idea to make it classic. It&#39;s a must see film that you prefer this movie a classic sci-fi film of the 2015.
