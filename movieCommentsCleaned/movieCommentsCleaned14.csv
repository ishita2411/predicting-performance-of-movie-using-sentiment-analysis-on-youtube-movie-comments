As mentioned by Aronofsky in interviews, &quot;death is what makes us human&quot;, and Tommy wanted to regain his humanity again by venturing into deep space and finally reach the Star of Immortality and merge it with the fabled South American Tree of Life to burst forth a new life, one that will never die (and essentially continue their romance for all eternity).",think tom space travel tom creo ad either cryogen preserv final discov secret immort discoveri tree guatemala render cell regener late discoveri give izzi half millennium went quest die nebula xibalba symbol journey meet death izzi aka queen isabella castil forev mention aronofski interview quot death make us human quot tommi want regain human ventur deep space final reach star immort merg fabl south american tree life burst forth new life one never die essenti continu romanc etern

1799,UNm9Tzo5rvI,This movie is horrible. One of the worst war movie that I&#39;ve seen. How it got good decent to good reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes is surprising. The movie was very poorly directed and had extremely bad pacing. Acting was sub-par. The story was way too fictional to even be base on true event.¬† For example how does Dengler escape the mob of angry villagers while his friend get chopped up while sitting right next to him. Fictional crap this like that made the movie feel less believable in a movie that is suppose to be base off something. Ending was worst.,movi horribl one worst war movi seen got good decent good review imdb rotten tomato surpris movi poorli direct extrem bad pace act sub par stori way fiction even base true event exampl dengler escap mob angri villag friend get chop sit right next fiction crap like made movi feel less believ movi suppos base someth end worst

My Problem is that most people don&#39;t want war but political heads in their cushy little worlds, prompt and sometimes create it for gains sometimes very much unknown to the culture from which it is started. What I am trying to say is both sides of a war are scared, think irrationally, have trouble understanding the opposition because of speech or¬† culture variant differences, therefore cannot express the identical things that they too fear or wish they had or have in common. I am now and then troubled by the fact that out of fear or the cultural differences (in essence, the ONLY thing that separates us). of course it is too bad that as HUMANS we treat each other worse than animals. this includes what Humans will do to each other within their own societies.<br>Enough Said!!<br>I need to get back to work.<br>Peace to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",person thought good movi watch movi often much haha grip though back yard chore pat finish wept damn hell pussi right haha problem peopl want war polit head cushi littl world prompt sometim creat gain sometim much unknown cultur start tri say side war scare think irrat troubl understand opposit speech cultur variant differ therefor express ident thing fear wish common troubl fact fear cultur differ essenc thing separ us cours bad human treat wors anim includ human within societi enough said need get back work peac everyon

The hostages talked to each other, why can&#39;t they all identify each other in the end based on voice and stories told?<br>3. The police had access to the footages from opening up to the point the painters walk in. Surely they can do a headcount, let alone when Denzel walks around, you&#39;d expect him to do the same. Did they not compare the numbers with the number that exited the building?<br>4. Why did they not sweep the bank with police dogs looking for anyone hiding?
