267,2CRjdwRYQbU,"The first 3 films of this series have been easily the more intelligent and relatable, for instance the 3rd film had at least some character development and spiritual and political side it was developing by showing how Soviets didn&#39;t learn from The US involvement in Vietnam, it even dared to go beyond the characters and more into philosophical matters of politics, sacrifice, self awareness, loyalty and serving Gods. I wish the next film tries to enrich its storyline without compensating for it by trying to be so-called realistic. It is not more realistic than any other Rambo film, it&#39;s an interpretation of realism, to be realistic you&#39;d have to be there and being shot at. Realism in movies is an illusion based on subjective perception, what was deemed realistic 50 years ago can be cheesy now. If you were on battlefield you&#39;d rarely ever see in such detail all the mayhem, you try to look away, this movie seems cartoonish to some people exactly because it revels in its violent detail, therefore it&#39;s harder to take seriously. Interpretation of realism is the key, not realism itself, that is an illusion driven by ego pushing an agenda of how reality is, remember everyone perceives reality differently, and audience naturally responds to a film as a piece of fiction and not as a documentary, but it can help them look into the things the film is based on. In terms of quality it&#39;s easily the weakest film of the series, but still good. There&#39;s a reason for the bigger success of the first 3 films, they were enjoyed equally by both males and females, because that was more light hearted to show dark realities of war, it was the interpretation that made a difference. One can not make a difference if the film is told in an inaccesible way, this sequel is more niche for niche audience than the first 3 films which were more mainstream with wider appeal. You use a specific tool and style to shine light on something, so far this film was as accessible almost as a documentary rather than a film seen by most. Filmmakers were even indecisive whether to use f bomb in the second film, that&#39;s how it matterd how they sell their interpretation of reality, because they knew that it&#39;s about selling awareness of such events to help people look into them more, realism should be the least of the concern when the audience doesn&#39;t take films as an evidence of what is real, people know it is not a documentary, why try selling it this way by alienating your wider and bigger audience?? Use the way that MOST people can stay with and look through.<br><br>To me it&#39;s a switch the brain off type of mindless action, 3/4th of the film is a video game non stop violence, not much development of characters like in most action war films, here the third act goes nowhere, straight forward by the numbers action film. The more you employ your brain the dumber the film appears to be.",first film seri easili intellig relat instanc rd film least charact develop spiritu polit side develop show soviet learn us involv vietnam even dare go beyond charact philosoph matter polit sacrific self awar loyalti serv god wish next film tri enrich storylin without compens tri call realist realist rambo film interpret realism realist shot realism movi illus base subject percept deem realist year ago cheesi battlefield rare ever see detail mayhem tri look away movi seem cartoonish peopl exactli revel violent detail therefor harder take serious interpret realism key realism illus driven ego push agenda realiti rememb everyon perceiv realiti differ audienc natur respond film piec fiction documentari help look thing film base term qualiti easili weakest film seri still good reason bigger success first film enjoy equal male femal light heart show dark realiti war interpret made differ one make differ film told inacces way sequel nich nich audienc first film mainstream wider appeal use specif tool style shine light someth far film access almost documentari rather film seen filmmak even indecis whether use f bomb second film matterd sell interpret realiti knew sell awar event help peopl look realism least concern audienc take film evid real peopl know documentari tri sell way alien wider bigger audienc use way peopl stay look switch brain type mindless action th film video game non stop violenc much develop charact like action war film third act goe nowher straight forward number action film employ brain dumber film appear

The thing that I&#39;m surprised about with this movie is the fact that they didn&#39;t say it was a Rambo 4 it&#39;s just called Rambo. I am hoping there will be a Rambo 5. I am also hoping that Sylvester Stallone plays in Rambo 5. I heard some talk about a remake for the first Rambo movie I don&#39;t know if this is true or false I hope it&#39;s not true though I hate remakes and reboot movies. Seems like every time they try to do reboots or a remake movie the windup ruining the story and it does not do good in the movie theaters I&#39;m just being honest here. Look a couple the movies they already did when they did remakes and reboots they pretty much failed in the movie theaters. So I hope this is false no remake of Rambo. If Sylvester Stallone does not do a Rambo 5 movie then I think they should do a TV series for Rambo. I think it could be done and I think it would turn out great if they had the right person to play Rambo if they did the TV series. I truly would love to see them do this in a CG type of thing.,rambo movi sylvest stallon fourth rambo movi number one top favorit rambo movi thing surpris movi fact say rambo call rambo hope rambo also hope sylvest stallon play rambo heard talk remak first rambo movi know true fals hope true though hate remak reboot movi seem like everi time tri reboot remak movi windup ruin stori good movi theater honest look coupl movi alreadi remak reboot pretti much fail movi theater hope fals remak rambo sylvest stallon rambo movi think tv seri rambo think could done think would turn great right person play rambo tv seri truli would love see cg type thing

However, because each reality seemed to exist in a different point in time, whether separated by minutes, as in the bang at the door, or microseconds, as in the moment when they saw themselves across the street, I think that it&#39;s the same situational reality replicated in past and future moments which would remedially explain why some events have already taken place and seem to repeat and overlap. (I can hardly understand what I just wrote since it&#39;s so difficult to explain.)<br>So, rather than there being other sets of themselves and others of the same house all existing at once, I sense there is just one set of people and one house but appearing to repeat due to the bending of time drawing all events, both future and past, of this situation to one point in time. I assume the house and the people at the beginning of the movie is the original copy, if you will, and that if they had stayed indoors, they wouldn&#39;t have set off the chain of skewed time effects creating past and future events of themselves and their reality.<br>It&#39;s mind-blowing to think that if I were in that situation and confronted another one (or two) of me, I wouldn&#39;t be so certain I could trust myself since all of me still have the same innate drive for self-preservation.",first thought movi depict multipl sure infinit realiti converg one point time space due gravit effect comet howev realiti seem exist differ point time whether separ minut bang door microsecond moment saw across street think situat realiti replic past futur moment would remedi explain event alreadi taken place seem repeat overlap hardli understand wrote sinc difficult explain rather set other hous exist sens one set peopl one hous appear repeat due bend time draw event futur past situat one point time assum hous peopl begin movi origin copi stay indoor set chain skew time effect creat past futur event realiti mind blow think situat confront anoth one two certain could trust sinc still innat drive self preserv

Sid, especially, was an accurate casting….he reminds me of more than a few local kids at my high school. <br><br>It is a surprisingly accurate representation of what life in the islands actually feels like. Whenever I’m asked what living in Hawaii is like I always refer to this film, as while there are nitpicks here and there, for the most part it gives a very good general gist. The only notable thing I would say is the local slang and pidgeon has been largely toned down, but that’s understandable in consideration of accommodating a broader audience who would be left clueless. But otherwise, you can tell they had a local advisor in their employ, and not someone who was operating on what they assumed living there was like, but who actually did.",speak someon grew live maui year attest least captur essenc daili life hawaii dress casual natur hous decor goat front yard yard plant open neighbor door simpli walk home gener laid back vibe local island cultur absolut nail sid especi accur cast remind local kid high school surprisingli accur represent life island actual feel like whenev ask live hawaii like alway refer film nitpick part give good gener gist notabl thing would say local slang pidgeon larg tone understand consider accommod broader audienc would left clueless otherwis tell local advisor employ someon oper assum live like actual

7050,SRRN6MvCdeg,@repzard99 Extiction took place 5 years after the apocalypse so I guess Jill were already with Chris while Carlos and L.J meet Claire and sticked with her.I guess the girl got killed or died cause I don&#39;t remember if they mentioned her. Carlos were already romantically involved with Alice in the Alice novels and as we could see a bit in extinction too(in one of the deleted scenes they even hold hands). Nice talking with you btw. :),repzard extict took place year apocalyps guess jill alreadi chri carlo l j meet clair stick guess girl got kill die caus rememb mention carlo alreadi romant involv alic alic novel could see bit extinct one delet scene even hold hand nice talk btw
7051,SRRN6MvCdeg,@PhoenixShadow000 Ah cool! :) Thanks for the info! They might mention her at some point by chris maybe talking about her so the others know they worked together already. At least I hope they will connect it this way so the story of the games can connect to the movies well. Crystal is the new character they added in the movie since Sienna(Jill) wasn&#39;t available. I think that the happenings of the movie take place before RE5 so Sheva didn&#39;t meet Chris yet. The trailer already makes me want more :),phoenixshadow ah cool thank info might mention point chri mayb talk other know work togeth alreadi least hope connect way stori game connect movi well crystal new charact ad movi sinc sienna jill avail think happen movi take place sheva meet chri yet trailer alreadi make want
7052,SRRN6MvCdeg,@repzard99 BTW: Jill would had been included in the fourth movie again but Sienna wasn&#39;t free for the role once again. :( So they left the character out in the hope to included in a new movie in the future. She would had also more martial arts moves in the second movie but the outfit from the third game she had on prevented her from doing so. That&#39;s why they limited her moves to punches and gunfights only.,repzard btw jill would includ fourth movi sienna free role left charact hope includ new movi futur would also martial art move second movi outfit third game prevent limit move punch gunfight
7053,SRRN6MvCdeg,@repzard99 Jills story were continued in the game RE5 by showing us in the &quot;lost nightmares&quot; that she went against wesker together with Chris. After what happened Wesker planted the device we saw in RE5 on her. The same device he also planted on Claire(in the movie). Chris &amp; Sheva saved Jill and Jill and Joss fought themselves out of there while Chris went against wesker with Sheva(Jill takes part in it at the end as far as I remember too). :) The third movie introduced the clones of Alice.,repzard jill stori continu game show us quot lost nightmar quot went wesker togeth chri happen wesker plant devic saw devic also plant clair movi chri amp sheva save jill jill joss fought chri went wesker sheva jill take part end far rememb third movi introduc clone alic

The fact that the films are so different from the game franchise is no excuse to immediately dismiss them though, in my opinion. You&#39;ve just got to look at them separately. This film looks to be the best in the series though I think, and even those who hated the past films will hopefully enjoy this one.",wait alway like film though much game admit fact film differ game franchis excus immedi dismiss though opinion got look separ film look best seri though think even hate past film hope enjoy one
7056,SRRN6MvCdeg,@repzard99 Well in the third movie they showed that the virus had spread outside the world anyway due to the experiments that were taking place outside of racoon. They also introduced wesker and ended the story of the doctor that made the modifications on alice and nemesis as also the story of carlos and the black guy. For that they introduced claire and created a continuety they could pick up for the 4th movie. Too bad wesker still found her and put a device on her like he did with Jill in RE5.,repzard well third movi show viru spread outsid world anyway due experi take place outsid racoon also introduc wesker end stori doctor made modif alic nemesi also stori carlo black guy introduc clair creat continueti could pick th movi bad wesker still found put devic like jill
7057,SRRN6MvCdeg,"@repzard99 I think you missunderstood me. ^_^ What I meant was to add them in a faschion that connects to the games story like they did with jill, carlos, nikolai and others before. As example, in the second movie we have parts of the third game, in the first movie they connect the first two games with the difference that Alice is in the core while the game characters that we don&#39;t see in the game are at the villa and city at the same time. Chris appears in the RE5 faschion. :)",repzard think missunderstood meant add faschion connect game stori like jill carlo nikolai other exampl second movi part third game first movi connect first two game differ alic core game charact see game villa citi time chri appear faschion
7058,SRRN6MvCdeg,"@bekjanov1 I think the approach they took by having a other main character for the movies than for the games gave them more space and flexibility. That&#39;s also why the movies are successfull. I too know all the games and like the series so I was skeptical at first when I saw the first movie. However, after I saw that they connected the games story with the movie one in parts that made sense I was ok with it. It would be boring to repeat the game anyway cause we would know everything that happens.",bekjanov think approach took main charact movi game gave space flexibl also movi successful know game like seri skeptic first saw first movi howev saw connect game stori movi one part made sens ok would bore repeat game anyway caus would know everyth happen
