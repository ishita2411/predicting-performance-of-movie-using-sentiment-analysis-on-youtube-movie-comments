45,WGS9M6uiOW4,"I know that 1955 was a desired year to love and live in and this was clearly seen by the way the artist set stage with its cars and artifacts throughout the movie. This movie has a universe of information and knowledge on how actors need to perform Maybe when we start watching this movie you will see what I am describing. This movie at first was skeptical and I was slightly concerned however it became masterpiece within a few minutes. To interact with actual actors is phenomenal. As a clever director does there was tons of irony , symbolism and procrastination to keep you at the end of your seat. Practically every scene was a masterpiece. Is the whole endeavor of moving to Paris a bright choice ? Turn on the television, find the movie , place on your undivided attention. The movie feels pleasure, it feels learned, it feels good , it feels sad , it feels like a lovely surprise. A small but very important movie and win or was it a loss of heart as I rank this a 9 !",know desir year love live clearli seen way artist set stage car artifact throughout movi movi univers inform knowledg actor need perform mayb start watch movi see describ movi first skeptic slightli concern howev becam masterpiec within minut interact actual actor phenomen clever director ton ironi symbol procrastin keep end seat practic everi scene masterpiec whole endeavor move pari bright choic turn televis find movi place undivid attent movi feel pleasur feel learn feel good feel sad feel like love surpris small import movi win loss heart rank

I am often exasperated at my best friend but there is no one else I respect more. So I hardly see Watson&#39;s &quot;exasperation&quot; at Holmes as a meaning of him not giving a huge respect to Holmes. You don&#39;t have to be all nice and kind and gentle to respect someone.

A trailer isn&#39;t everything and just because they didn&#39;t show those &quot;respect&quot; scenes doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t any.

The Austrian royal family at the time of empress Maria Theresa was, for it&#39;s time, very philanthropic that meant that Marie Antoinettes upbringing involved a lot of charity and caring for the poor, hence it being unlikely she every said &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;. Marie Antoinette also tried to push the king to reform and make him force the nobility and clergy to pay tax so that some of the weight could be lifted of the poor. It is true that she liked extravegance, but in many ways she was also trying her best to be a good queen and even tried to make the court a little more informal. She has just been prone to a lot of bad publicity and a good example of the &quot;Whenever it is going bad blame the foreigner&quot; mentality.t.",interestingli enough although histori portray evil spoil quit contrari austrian royal famili time empress maria theresa time philanthrop meant mari antoinett upbring involv lot chariti care poor henc unlik everi said quot let eat cake quot mari antoinett also tri push king reform make forc nobil clergi pay tax weight could lift poor true like extraveg mani way also tri best good queen even tri make court littl inform prone lot bad public good exampl quot whenev go bad blame foreign quot mental
1114,yBWyKRoh98U,"Jan, I think she did actually say let them eat cake. But I think through implication she was trying to suggest or pretend to those surrounding her, that she really believed what she said, and they played along with it. <br><br>But really,  they all knew full well, including Marie, the seriousness of the situation.<br><br>The situation was one of extreme bad news. <br>You have all these starving people at your gate because they have no bread. It‚Äôs terrible. And yes it‚Äôs a depressing scene not just for the starving poor but also for those who had to witness it. <br><br>We all know there are beggars on the street and they aren‚Äôt a cherry sight, are they. And neither was this dreadful spectacle. <br><br>Marie and her entourage were understandably trying to maintain the delicate delicious life, and by saying let them eat bread, which she did say, was actually an attempt to keep everyone including herself lifted up in this wonderfully uplifted mindset that they were used to living in. <br><br>They were used to living in this uplifted state of mind with an absence of all problems and she, by conveying the pretence, that she was blissfully unaware of the state of these starving people, was trying to keep her entourage in this lovely lifted mindset. <br><br>Those around her that were of nobility knew exactly what she was doing and probably appreciated it, however the less wise servants would have interpreted it very differently and seen it as either a callousness or an obliviousness to the state of her people. <br><br>Hence today her statement lives on in infamy with many believing she was a royal who was out of touch. No no no. Not out of touch. But not a very touching thing to say around servants with big ears who would misunderstand. <br><br>She is a splendid example of being so perfectly politically incorrect that her statement lives on today, 230 year later. <br><br>She would have lost her head anyway. That‚Äôs what starving people do. They blame the other guy who ain‚Äôt hungry. <br><br>If she left town on a fast horse she might have gotten away. Eventually that‚Äôs what she did but she left her run too late and instead went bravely to the scaffold. <br><br>The mob was taken back by her bravery but they wildly cheered as they severed the head from her delicate body. <br><br>‚ÄúAh the people, Aristotle. Be careful of them when their blood is up. They will cut your throat and cheer. Is it not therefore better to wear the disguise of a beggar than to be killed by them and spat upon.

2592,J7bAZCOk0Sc,"Listen, this move was extremely avant-garde, so I&#39;m not going to cover plot, dialogue richness, or narrative cohesion.  This movie is extremely thematic and wants to make a point, so that is what I want to focus on.  If you want wall to wall entertainment, it will be a chore to watch.  However if you enjoy exploring big ideas with big visual gambles, then get popcorn and press play.   <br><br>This movie is about feminine identity through and through.  One of the ways in which the director makes us explore feminine identity is by giving men a disturbing equality with full frontal nudity.  It was horrifying, but that is supposed to be your reaction after being shielded from that visual since the inception of movies.  Women are to be ornamental, whereas men have always had their reproductive organs shielded in an almost reverential religious awe.  <br><br>There is also a recurring theme of the male chaperones.  While I fully understand she is baiting men to sink into a black resin in order to harvest their innards, the optics are clear, she is not to be without male presence.  Either a man finds her, or she finds one.  There is a perennial male figure that appears as if he is overseeing her operations.  Every other man is drawn forward by libidinal motivation.  Some are kind others are predatory, but all lust after her.    There is a scene in which a group of party going women scoop up Scarlett Johansson&#39;s nameless character (table that) into a club.  She is absolutely ill at ease.  She looks hesitant even slightly panicked.  She tries to escape and is only restored to calm when a suitor tries to buy her a drink.  She eventually lures him back into her lair in which she secures another body. <br><br>This lair of Johansson&#39;s is all black.  This is alluding to the ignorance surrounding true female identity.  Female identity is portrayed as mysterious, backward moving (important), manipulative, predatory, and ultimately dangerous to men.   I don&#39;t believe the director is saying this is what true female identity is, rather this is the societal representation.   There are only two qualities that interest me.  The backward movement and the blackness.  <br><br>To be fair let us quickly cover manipulation and an underhanded predatory nature.   She is in literally &quot;the driver&#39;s seat&quot; for most of the movie, that is to say seemingly in control.  What is the outcome, deceit and treachery.  Put women in charge and they will destroy you.  Okay that&#39;s good enough.  <br><br>Now let&#39;s get back to backward movement. This was a conscious decision.  The lure would have worked just as well if she moved forward away from the man occasionally looking over her shoulder.  The backward movement is important because she does this BY HERSELF as she looks in the mirror.  You know something is important when it has a call back.  She looks at her naked body and begins to walk back.  Why is this important.  This is how many feminist try to recover female identity.  They ponder to themselves, &quot;What was I before I bore children, before I got married, before I had sex, before, I was given a name?&quot;  This regressive hunt for identity is nested the assigned identity as sexual object.  In the middle of her job, she wonders who is she really.  This is the constant motif of mirror gazing.  <br><br>Sex is the sticking point of female identity.  She uses it to lure men.  She hypnotizes with it, that is until she is confronted with the primary utility of the act itself in which case she freaks out.  There is a disconnect between her subversive power over sex attraction, and the functionality of sex itself.  It is no coincidence that she is on bottom.  This missionary position is performed by a caring man and also with the cruel rapist. In the actual act, be it with a kind man securing consent, or a rapist without mercy, she understands actual sex is a losing proposition.  She looses in the game of being gotten.   There is a ambiguous relationship she has with her body.  It is a source of her power and simueltaneous the cause of her mental and physical domination.    <br><br>The second truth is the mysterious quality represented by pitch black.  I spoke about how the room played to her mystic, but her inward image of jet black is an admission of women being a puzzlement to their own eyes.  This mystery does not inspire poetry, affection, or exploration, it encourages violence as was played out when she was burned alive.  Past the prospect of sex, there seems to be an unfeeling from men, even a fright.   She is punished for not being what she was conditioned to be, and the smoke of her torment goes up to heaven is a black ashy cloud.  <br><br>One more quick observation.  I&#39;m sure there is a thing about eating disorders with the chocolate cake, but there is not enough for me to make that connection.   Thought provoking stuff.",listen move extrem avant gard go cover plot dialogu rich narr cohes movi extrem themat want make point want focu want wall wall entertain chore watch howev enjoy explor big idea big visual gambl get popcorn press play movi feminin ident one way director make us explor feminin ident give men disturb equal full frontal nuditi horrifi suppos reaction shield visual sinc incept movi women ornament wherea men alway reproduct organ shield almost reverenti religi awe also recur theme male chaperon fulli understand bait men sink black resin order harvest innard optic clear without male presenc either man find find one perenni male figur appear overse oper everi man drawn forward libidin motiv kind other predatori lust scene group parti go women scoop scarlett johansson nameless charact tabl club absolut ill eas look hesit even slightli panick tri escap restor calm suitor tri buy drink eventu lure back lair secur anoth bodi lair johansson black allud ignor surround true femal ident femal ident portray mysteri backward move import manipul predatori ultim danger men believ director say true femal ident rather societ represent two qualiti interest backward movement black fair let us quickli cover manipul underhand predatori natur liter quot driver seat quot movi say seemingli control outcom deceit treacheri put women charg destroy okay good enough let get back backward movement consciou decis lure would work well move forward away man occasion look shoulder backward movement import look mirror know someth import call back look nake bodi begin walk back import mani feminist tri recov femal ident ponder quot bore children got marri sex given name quot regress hunt ident nest assign ident sexual object middl job wonder realli constant motif mirror gaze sex stick point femal ident use lure men hypnot confront primari util act case freak disconnect subvers power sex attract function sex coincid bottom missionari posit perform care man also cruel rapist actual act kind man secur consent rapist without merci understand actual sex lose proposit loos game gotten ambigu relationship bodi sourc power simueltan caus mental physic domin second truth mysteri qualiti repres pitch black spoke room play mystic inward imag jet black admiss women puzzlement eye mysteri inspir poetri affect explor encourag violenc play burn aliv past prospect sex seem unfeel men even fright punish condit smoke torment goe heaven black ashi cloud one quick observ sure thing eat disord chocol cake enough make connect thought provok stuff

3860,HAQVYYqj3Ro,"Slick. Worthy of Capra or Riefenstahl, who, of course, had narratives to spin  for their respective target audiences as well. Perhaps only a French film could be unabashed enough to cut to the core surrounding this issue. Our heroine isn‚Äôt the favoured extreme case  of more squeamish Anglo audiences. On the contrary, a sexually liberated pioneer of the self actualised, current year, ideal Marxist-feminist western everywoman is presented to the audience. The central conflict of the piece, the fact that she is meant to have licence while at the same time she also has no licence - she is meant to be oppressed, after all - will always be tough to represent due to cognitive dissonance being hard to capture on celluloid. On the one hand she is clearly an agent who acts with agency, she is studying with a view to exploiting the capitalist system to improve her social standing (aspirations) and she is capable of initiating a sexual relationship - overtly sexual, even, perhaps, after all there‚Äôs no long term goal beyond the sex, so way to simulate pioneering third wave, sister. On the other hand, she ‚Äûfalls‚Äú pregnant, which is a concept, which needs to be unwrapped. How could this have happened? Clearly for the sophisticated audience this does not require much in the way of explication.<br>Yet the filmmakers chose the 60s as their setting. France‚Äòs insurance system covered use of the pill from 1964 onwards, it‚Äôs use was enshrined in law by 1967. Condoms and other forms of prophylactic were readily available in France, which had ceased to be socially conservative after the end of the last war. So, how does one ‚Äûfall‚Äú pregnant if one is at the same time a fully self actualised feminist protagonist? Well clearly the patriarchy is to blame for this sorry state of affairs. Pregnancy, which may or may not have some direct correlation with intercourse, is terribly oppressive if it happens to you when you can‚Äôt be asked. Clearly then the solution must be an abortion and clearly something as pesky as a legal code can only serve as a foil against which the true image of the fully self actualised protagonist can be allowed to take shape. After all, the young woman could face having to dial down those aspirations if the unwanted pregnancy comes to term, while the chances of going to jail as a result of the illegally procured abortion ‚Ä¶ performative contradiction ‚Ä¶ never mind‚Ä¶ moving on ‚Ä¶ clearly again we see chauvinism at work. Grotesque. So of course the law must be changed. Are we not lucky that young women can have unprotected sex to their heart‚Äôs content and get rid of any inconvenient accidents along the way. Truly a triumph of modern man. Thank you France for producing directors capable of getting to the point on this one, like only you can. A triumph of total lack of ambiguity. Truly transcendent. This is what a victory lap looks like boys and girls.",slick worthi capra riefenstahl cours narr spin respect target audienc well perhap french film could unabash enough cut core surround issu heroin favour extrem case squeamish anglo audienc contrari sexual liber pioneer self actualis current year ideal marxist feminist western everywoman present audienc central conflict piec fact meant licenc time also licenc meant oppress alway tough repres due cognit disson hard captur celluloid one hand clearli agent act agenc studi view exploit capitalist system improv social stand aspir capabl initi sexual relationship overtli sexual even perhap long term goal beyond sex way simul pioneer third wave sister hand fall pregnant concept need unwrap could happen clearli sophist audienc requir much way explic yet filmmak chose set franc insur system cover use pill onward use enshrin law condom form prophylact readili avail franc ceas social conserv end last war one fall pregnant one time fulli self actualis feminist protagonist well clearli patriarchi blame sorri state affair pregnanc may may direct correl intercours terribl oppress happen ask clearli solut must abort clearli someth peski legal code serv foil true imag fulli self actualis protagonist allow take shape young woman could face dial aspir unwant pregnanc come term chanc go jail result illeg procur abort perform contradict never mind move clearli see chauvin work grotesqu cours law must chang lucki young women unprotect sex heart content get rid inconveni accid along way truli triumph modern man thank franc produc director capabl get point one like triumph total lack ambigu truli transcend victori lap look like boy girl
