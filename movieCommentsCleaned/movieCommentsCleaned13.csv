But then, the need to feel certain emotions overcomes whatever that seems to disprove or disable those emotions. Science is not against feelings, science by the methods that builds its structure, is prepared to test assertions and discard lies, even the pretty ones; but there is still room for pretty truths.

658,8Jz-8UcCiws,"This is the first Die Hard film I was old enough to see at the theater.  No, it&#39;s not anywhere near as good as the first Die Hard (what is?), but I saw this at a Midnight screening after a Prince concert back in 2007, and after the high of that concert this was one of my favourite filmgoing experiences.  Yes, some of the set-pieces are very silly and it lacks the relative credibility of the first Die Hard or even Die Hard with a Vengeance, but this is still fun, the Willis and Justin Long interplay is highly enjoyable, and Timothy Olyphant is arguably the best Die Hard villain after the brilliant Alan Rickman (Jeremy Irons was good too, but I don&#39;t think he was quite as nasty as Rickman and Olyphant&#39;s characters).",first die hard film old enough see theater anywher near good first die hard saw midnight screen princ concert back high concert one favourit filmgo experi ye set piec silli lack rel credibl first die hard even die hard vengeanc still fun willi justin long interplay highli enjoy timothi olyph arguabl best die hard villain brilliant alan rickman jeremi iron good think quit nasti rickman olyph charact

The way the tricks were presented made me feel like i was watching a stage show and i really enjoyed it, felt entranced, fully absorbed in the enchantment. What i like about this movie is that people, who love to enjoy magic for the sake of it, will feel the pure sense of fascination, and people, who want to find out the trick, lift the enchantment, will find out. It works in both directions, because it never claimed to be real magic, but an illusion.",love movi discov year releas way trick present made feel like watch stage show realli enjoy felt entranc fulli absorb enchant like movi peopl love enjoy magic sake feel pure sens fascin peopl want find trick lift enchant find work direct never claim real magic illus

1907,fdu10cX3pWA,"Since this was mankind‚Äôs first deviation from the correct worship of God as taught by Prophet Adam, God, in his infinite Kindness and Mercy, fulfilled His promise to Adam to send messengers as guidance for mankind.  God sent Noah(Nuh), the first of His Messengers.[4]  Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad said:<br><br>‚ÄúOn the day of Judgement, the people will come to Noah and say ‚ÄòOh Noah, you are the first of the Messengers sent to earth, and God called you a thankful slave.‚Äô‚Äù(Saheeh Al-Bukhari)<br><br>Worshipping anything other than God has grave consequences, the least of which is a lack of freedom; for Satan enslaves man, destroys his mind and renders him unable to distinguish between right and wrong.  When Noah warned his people of the torment that awaited them if they did not give up their idolatry, his warning fell mostly on deaf ears.  Noah explained Satan‚Äôs deceit, but his people turned away and refused to listen.  Noah warned them day and night; he announced his message in public and he spoke quietly to people privately; yet all, but a few, denied his words.  Noah cried out to God.<br><br>‚ÄúHe said: ‚ÄòO my Lord!  Verily, I have called my people night and day (secretly and openly to accept the doctrine of Islamic Monotheism), but all my calling added nothing but to their flight from the truth.  Verily!  Every time I called unto them that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, and persisted (in their refusal), and magnified themselves in pride.‚Äù (Quran 71:5-7)<br><br>Those who responded to Noah‚Äôs call were the weakest and poorest of his people; the leaders and those with power responded arrogantly and rejected the call.  They said:<br><br>‚ÄúVerily we see you in plain error‚Äù (Quran 7:60)<br><br>Noah continued to appeal to his people, day after day and year after year.",sinc mankind first deviat correct worship god taught prophet adam god infinit kind merci fulfil promis adam send messeng guidanc mankind god sent noah nuh first messeng abu hurairah narrat prophet muhammad said day judgement peopl come noah say oh noah first messeng sent earth god call thank slave saheeh al bukhari worship anyth god grave consequ least lack freedom satan enslav man destroy mind render unabl distinguish right wrong noah warn peopl torment await give idolatri warn fell mostli deaf ear noah explain satan deceit peopl turn away refus listen noah warn day night announc messag public spoke quietli peopl privat yet deni word noah cri god said lord verili call peopl night day secretli openli accept doctrin islam monoth call ad noth flight truth verili everi time call unto might forgiv thrust finger ear cover garment persist refus magnifi pride quran respond noah call weakest poorest peopl leader power respond arrogantli reject call said verili see plain error quran noah continu appeal peopl day day year year

2839,MJIcZGEjjwo,"People should really stop judging the movie before they see it, especially based off of the trailer. Movie trailers nowadays are like mini-films themselves. They&#39;re created by companies completely separate from the production team of the film itself. An entirely different group of people that weren&#39;t involved with the making of the film receive a rough copy of a movie and have to think of a way to present it to captivate the widest possible audience. They use many tactics to do this, and a lot of what goes into movie trailer production is a manipulation of the actual film itself. Scenes play out and are edited differently in trailers than in the actual film many times. So stop being so judgmental and wait for the actual film to come out before you say anything. And if you KNOW you&#39;re not going to see the film, why are you taking the time out of your day to post about it and be so negative instead of doing something else with your time? Are your comments even productive? There&#39;s a difference between giving and honest, constructive opinion of a film and simply saying &quot;this looks awful lol&quot; or &quot;this will FLOP&quot;.
