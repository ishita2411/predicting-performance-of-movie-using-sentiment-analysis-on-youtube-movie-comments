kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie the other day I really liked it
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaEXCELSIOR.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitais anyone else bothered that Bradley&#39;s character us looked at as the bad for beating up the guy? I mean, I don&#39;t blame him for snapping. He comes home from work to find his wife in the shower, having sex with another man, who I want to say was a coworker. To make matters worse their wedding song was playing. Like how badly can you give your husband the finger? And his wife doesn&#39;t get any punishment for it. In fact, all Bradley&#39;s character still had feelings for his wife even after everything she did.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita♥️♥️♥️
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is wonderfully crafted.  Strongly recommended this one.. Watching in 2022.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaIt’s such a beautiful film, very funny, very wholesome.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaWhere I can get the full version?
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaCult classic 👌
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t even seen the movie yet but it reminds me of myself that girl how overly blunt she is and how nobody can really put up with her
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie didn’t make any sense to me when I watched it. <br>Sadly. It does now
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita5:17 Am April 16th 2022
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI’m about to watch this movie for the first time
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitabest movie ive ever watched
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI hate that hes married
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI can relate ❤️
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita“ do you want to have dinner at this diner ?” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaLove this film
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that people think this is accurate to these mental illnesses is hilarious &amp; horrific. Genuinely the worst movie I’ve ever tried to watch—the characters personalities, dialogue &amp; plot is horrible. &amp; I have a very open mind and prefer obscure things 😅
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaSheesh An artist mentioned this movie in his song and now It got me in my feels
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitam
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitadont know why they deemed the guy insane he had every right to beat the hell out of the bloke. you would have to be a second to jesus not to loose your temper coming home from work to that. our society is messed up.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI knew I would love this movie before starting it and now it&#39;s my favourite movie
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaDoes any one know what this movie is called ? I&#39;m going to watch it tonight ,,plus listen to my music or I&#39;ll get my bro Vin diesel on yall
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThis film is so significant to me as I too suffer from manic depressive bipolar disorder with psychosis tendencies. This movie and 12 years of my life proves even with a mental illness or chemical embalance you can find someone who loves you for all of it 💯
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita❤ Stay positive.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaA Great 👍 and Beautiful 😍 ❤ good 👍 movie 🎬 🎞 🎥 🎦

kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure what to think about this movie.<br>It&#39;s by Bob &amp; Harvey Weinstein but there&#39;s no sex, there&#39;s no nudity, except for JLaws back lol!<br><br>Just kidding!<br>It doesn&#39;t need it!<br>Magnificent!!!
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI have bipolar disorder and this film is the most fair, honest and accurate depiction of the condition. Love this movie.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThank you for consummating the marriage, Lord.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaGreat film, happy that it had a good ending. But seriously guys, don&#39;t gamble
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaWhy did they have to turn a perfectly nice movie into a romance? They should&#39;ve focused more in Pat&#39;s illness. The ending made me cringe and completely cheaped the experience for me.

kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita360P is NOT an HD trailer. Are you kidding me?

kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaNever thought I&#39;d enjoy a romance but what a movie
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThis film misses the point about Bipolar disorder and depression in general. <br>Wishful thinking doesn’t cure depression. And therapy by itself doesn’t cure a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes deep depression. Saying stay positive is a nonsensical answer to depression. <br><br>You have a shot at a Silver lining if you stay positive is also a useless statement. I suffered from deep depression years ago. If someone said stay positive to me that meant nothing. I felt like I was in a dark hole mentally that I couldn’t climb out of by myself. And I was suicidal. I somehow got through those dark days and the dark thoughts in my head lifted. Now I realize I was in danger and needed professional help. So this movie is not going to help anyone with Bipolar disorder or depression. <br><br>And Bipolar disorder is very real. <br>I knew someone at work who had it and without his meds his behavior was very unstable and unpredictable. I never knew what he was going to say or do. He was potentially dangerous. Luckily he quit.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaExcellent Movie.

kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaHow come Jacki Weaver doesn&#39;t get a name drop?
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so well done and entertaining.  Every scene was great.  Usually films drag at a point, but this one didn’t.  Riveting from start to finish.  Every actor in this including the supporting cast was top notch.

kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshita(Spoiler) I don’t think I can overstate how significant this film is to me. As a person with bipolar disorder, this was my first ever experience watching someone like me actually get their happy ending in a film, and it gave me hope during a very dark period in my life.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, with amazing performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert De Niro, it’s just too bad Joy was a disappointment
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThey need make more movies like this, mental illness but more about their lives and positivity
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaAnyone noticed the movie theater was playing Midnight Meat Train. Which my man Brad Cooper was awesome in?
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI’m not really into these type of movies but I love this one 👌🏼 totally unexpected of how great it was.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitathe top of the world at age 30. happy birthday aug 15
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaLoved the book, the movie was good too! :)
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is great! really made my day to be honest ,relatable in many ways .you all will love it great heartfelt movie and it&#39;s a true story of the man who wrote it
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI dont watch romantic movies but ima give this one a shot
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitathis trailer makes me happy
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence deserves an oscar for just living this life
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence is so amazing indeed,  I love her so much. True story guys I love her in fact I wish I could clone her for myself. She&#39;s beautiful, talented and I hate her husband. No, I&#39;m not a stalker or a freak I&#39;m just devastated by her beauty.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most romantic movies ever... BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL MOVIE... ❤❤❤
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI only watch it because Jennifer lawrence  is in it
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaVim pelo cultura
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaOK. I&#39;m about to watch this!!! I love Love!!!!🤞💙
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaFAVOURITE MOVIE- LOVE IT
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaProbably the worst film I&#39;ve ever watched in my life. I wonder why this shit was nominated for the Oscars. David O&#39;Russell sucks
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie.....Jennifer Lawrence is soooo BEAUTIFUL!
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaSoy bipolar desde que era una pequeña, pero está bien. Sé todo lo doloroso de ser así, y también sé cómo salir adelante, así que si eres así, no te desanimes, saldrás bien de todo. Ten fe en ti mismo, en tu familia que te ama, amigos o lo que sea, pero sobre todo en Dios, que nunca te desamparará.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI have bipolar and I think all we need in life is to dedicate our lives to something that means something to us and to find connection with others.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaGrief for your &quot;loved ones&quot; can end with tragedies and/or good surprises, but you can not find a &quot;new father and mother&quot; contrary to &quot;new partner&quot;.
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI watch this movie 20x already.. 😂😂😂
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite romance movies
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaI love love Jennifer Lawrence but this movie is ridiculous.. And the role not deserving to be even nominated for the oscars
kVS-6k2tQAAdelimeterByIshitaYes, she so richly deserved the OSCAR!

ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaBcoz of D&#39;s movie I love to race
ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaStill my favorite movie ever. This is the reason I love cars and everything about it. This was an inspiration to me as a child. Lol I remember having mini Paul Walker and Vin figures as a kid. This movie was and probably still is my life haha. Rip Paul - From one of the many you inspired and shared your passion with 🙏
ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite parts were 1st ,2nd and Tokyo Drift. Those were down to earth movies with tuned cars that a decent guy could have and street culture. Now it`s full off science fiction ,almost no law of physics and no logics.
ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaLol and now there doing worldwide James Bond missions, they should have just kept it local. 
ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaWhen F&amp;F was all about the enthusiasm of tuning and driving fast. R.I.P Paul.
ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaI was doing this way before this movie came out..every Friday and Saturday night I was street racing ever sense I was 16..I&#39;m 37 now and I still catch myself on the interstate in my 2001 firebird( which I bought brand new and still got it) pulling up next to someone and giving the ole 3 honk signal to race..and i turn into a whole different person when I do race..I also love the drag strip miss it!

ZsJz2TJAPjwdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite F&amp;F car was in this one. It&#39;s not a car a lot of people would chose as their fav but I loved the JETTA!

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitashe&#39;s a girls, just a tom boy.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitavery clever title and movie.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitathat was his daughter..at the beginning i swear it was a boy 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus Has Fallen...?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI lost the rocket launcher... lmao

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitastarted from the bottom now were here 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIS THIS A SIGN THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING DOWN IN THE FUTURE ? !! 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhite House Down and Olympus Has Fallen are both unoriginal.  They&#39;re remakes of Die Hard, which was probably a remake of something else.. nothing is new or original.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a Hollywood thing, they release 2 very similar films the same year to garner more interest and sales... Olympus Has Fallen - White House Down, Snow White - Mirror Mirror, The Illusionist - The Prestige, Mission to Mars - Red Planet, Deep Impact - Armageddon, Dante&#39;s Peak - Volcano.... etc.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitano no no its nothing like it! in olympus has fallen the white house gets overrun by terrorists and gerard butler has to save everyone, in white house down CHANNING TATUM saves the president couldnt be anymore different lol.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaexept the president is BLACK AS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitafinally a black president
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOf Boredom 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitalol I was waiting for my video to play and this ad came on and I actually liked it and now im here :)
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitawtf led zeppelin??
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was being made before Olympus Has Fallen.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWell this movie seems like a barrel of laughs along with a bunch of violence...I know it probably sounds counter productive to say &quot;I&#39;m gonna watch this movie for those exact reasons&quot; but that is exactly what I am saying.
Oh wait...I think that&#39;s the only reason why anyone would go to see this movie, for some laughs and violence. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaHow is it a copy? Chances are both movies were produced at the same time

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI hope  you dont believe or  think that one production company can cast, film, edit and distribute a movie in only a month just because of the success of another film?
Is that what you think? It obvious to me that they were both film around the same time. Just happen to be release the same year.  It happens before 
Deep Impact/Armageddon 1988
Dante Peek/Volcano 1996
Friends with Benefits/ No String Attach 2012
ton more.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus has fallen, White House down.. what&#39;s next Hollywood? At times I feel the President&#39;s role in this country is only being &quot;used&quot;.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaActually this was first announced either BEFORE or on the release of Olympus has Fallen.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks funny and cool
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitadie hard!?!?!?!?!!??!?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitahas not had
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIs that Led Zeppelin?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitai think i&#39;ll go see it for what will hopefully be hilarious moments between the protagonist and the president.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis is such a copy of Olympus had fallen
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis looks just like Olympus has Fallen but I will still see it.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaDamn...  The time between remakes and their originals are getting shorter and shorter.  

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaBlack president Saying Black things Lol Thats funny!!!:D
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaMmm mm mm mass programming for tha serfs.. I mean the People - President Obama Foxx
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus has fallen yet again. And it&#39;s up to a reject secret service agent to save the day, again.

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIt looks like the movie Olympus Has Fallen i want to see White House Down now to compare lol
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitatotally reminded me of Olympus ha Fallen even the name
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re dying.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t he a bit young to be playing a dad of a teenager?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitathis is the comedy version of that movie and don&#39;t pretend like you actually went to see that other one 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitabeginning song name?????
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshita3 movies of America being taken over in less then a year... The fuck is going on?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus has fallen 2, already?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaBut at least it doesn&#39;t look that bad right?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE IS AS ORIGINAL AS ALL THE COMMENTS!!!
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitait looks better than  OLYMPUSCE IS FALLING 

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaChanning Tatum makes a difference.
Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaFrom a slave to the President in only 6 months. Only J. Foxx could do that.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks very stupid and cheesy... Still gonna see it.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThe difference between this movie and Olympus Has Fallen? This movie looks like it will actually be worth watching.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhoa
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitawhats the song at the beginning???

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus Has Fallen 2. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaYes but this one may actually be worth watching.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaDident a movie like this come out recently Olympus has fallen oh wait this is completely different it has Channing Tatum CHANNING TATUM MAKES IT COMPLETELY FUCKING DIFFERENT.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOh hey, look, another movie about terrorists attacking the White House that will, without a doubt, completely ignore all pretenses of reality in favor of action and explosions. Would not watch under any circumstances.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaBlack Hawk Down = White House Down........Kay.

This is like the comical version of Olympus Has Fallen.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaawesome! a new, totally original, never before thought of MOVIE ADVENTURE. IM SO PUMPED FOR THIS TOTALLY NEW AND ORIGINAL MOVIE 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaNot a bad version of &quot;Black Dog&quot;
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaLook&#39;s Epic !
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitawhat is the song in thebeginning?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOf course! Why NOT Jamie Foxx as the president of the United States of America!
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaUh... Maybe someone should tell Jamie Foxx that Olympus has already Fallen.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaisnt Jamie Foxx against Guns? hahaha hypocrite 

Propoganda anyone?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaLol. It looks like the more comedic version of Olympus has Fallen haha
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaAction and a little hint of comedy? You got me wanting to watch this Sony. But this time, don&#39;t copy Olympus Has Fallen.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaHey, I saw this when Gerard Butler was in it.... And it was SO MUCH BETTER
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaOlympus has fallen, white house has fallen, holden hostages, family member in danger, same movie and released just like 2 months later after Olympus has fallen lol
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re putting it out there that an attack, or false flag is coming.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaolympus has fallen
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaFun :)
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaEven the president isn&#39;t immune to black stereotypes. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaStep 1 - Combine Olympus has Fallen and Paul Blart: Mall Cop
Step 2 - ???
Step 3 - Profit
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaIt appears like another version of &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshita2:09 also a RIP OFF from Air Force one with Harrison Ford only his line was better. If someone makes a fake Olympus has fallen video they should use this trailer if they make an Air force one part 2 lol yup use that scene.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaLol Wow Olympus has fallen or White House down choices choices these two are soooo different.

Well aside from the rip off I don&#39;t like Jamie Fox as president and the other movie should have used Morgan Freeman as president but this one does look better oddly enough given the damn blatant attempt at copy lol.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitalady: &quot;why do you want to be in the secret service?&quot;
man: &quot;i cant think of a more important job than protecting the president.&quot;
me: &quot;HAHA, no, really why do you want to be in the secret service?&quot;
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaGet. Yo. Hands. Off. My. Jordans!
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at the beginning?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaSame plot
Same actor
Same place
The hell???
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI think this is more of a spoof than a real movie. Doubt it&#39;s a rip. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible. The helicopter CGi is awful and the racism is obvious.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThis is Roland Emmerich! Have you not seen Independence Day? It was full of one liners, and small gags. I expect this one will be no different.  

Olympus Has Fallen was a more serious film, you should see that if seriousness is what you&#39;re after.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t they made a movie about the White House and how it got destroyed. And wasn&#39;t it out this year.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaThe presidents name is james sawyer... isnt that the guy from lost lol.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI see the White House is popular this year... 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaLol, Jamie is the president? Awesome.

GET OFF HIS JORDANS
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t they make a serious film about this without all these jokes and obvious cringe worthy lines? War of the Worlds (2005) was an excellently done crisis film and was actually serious.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaRip off of Olympus has fallen
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaAwesome !
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI think this movie already came out a few months ago. Hollywood is so lame, I guess Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman weren&#39;t authentic enough
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaliked the trailer... can anyone tell me the name of the song?

WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitadidnt they blow up white house already? with Gerald Butler and stuffs...
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaWhy did they make Channing&#39;s daughter so old? He&#39;s in his early 30s and she looks like she&#39;s about 13.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI FOUND ANOTHER ONE OF KIMS ACCOUNTS!!
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaAnother romantic comedy?
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaI thought this was going to be a serious movie. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaFuck you.
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitame too then we will have hd footage of a country being nuked back into the stone age. 
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitaHaha looks pretty funny
WfaTlmYvTA8delimeterByIshitai hope korea do that :)
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaLOL! Terry Crews!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaHey Look! Its Adam Sandler Movie, Can&#39;t Wait. Said No One Ever.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaContinuation from 50 First Dates where Drew Barrymore forgets she&#39;s married to Adam Sandler and have 6 kids.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitareally hollywood ... really
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaJesus! Not again. when will Adam Sandler stop making movies?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita50 first dates + 1?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitawell I&#39;m disappointed. When I heard they were both doing another movie together I had some hope but not really anymore. I mean it looks ok, I guess but I didn&#39;t really like 50 first dates either. My sister liked it
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaJust Go With It In Africa
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWhat haaaapened to Adam? 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaLove movies like this loll :) cant wait to see this :)))))

8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaGoddammit adam...
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaPure shit...
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaI think Terry Crews will probably be the best person in this movie. I just have no idea why this studio keeps having Adam Sandler in the job since this IS the only studio that would keep working with him. I lost faith in Adam Sandler. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews lmao
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitagonna watch terry crew&#39;s part again and again
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaJust go with it 2 perhaps 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWell, the music was good.

8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaShouldq been wedding singer 2, working title of courese
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler isn&#39;t that funny anymore. I miss him in the older movies. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaThis is just like just go with it<br>
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaIs this sequel to 50 first date?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler and  Tyler Perry, true enigmas.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTERRY OH MY GOD HAHAHA
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaGrown Ups 3? Hahaha
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MuWt2X59fo&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> Bella Thorne?!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitais this Just go with it 2? ...
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitachrist, what a cringe-fest. maybe now you&#39;ll have enough money, Adam.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaSANDLER STAHP!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaI dont think even Terry Crews can save this one
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaI heard Joel McHale was in here
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaDamn it, Terry Crews might force me too watch an boring opposites attract romance with Sandler. Crews has my vote!!!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita50 first dates.....
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaonly interested because of mr. cheeseburgers
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitathe new 50 first dates?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAnother Adam Sandler movie... great. His movies are about as funny as a botched abortion. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitahopefully they have a 50 first dates reference lul
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler, is a stapler.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaSpoiler: Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore fall in love. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAny One Remember 50 Date<br>This is 150 Dates now
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaHad to go back to what works best plus add terry crews.<br>Step back sandler or find a better project.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews...that&#39;s all there is
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaI gave up on the sandmans movies a while ago. Last decent film he had was Grow ups 1. this looks too similar to &quot;just go with it&quot;
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Jennifer Aniston? omg I though it was &quot;Just Go with it 2&quot;
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitalooks horrible
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaBiggest grin on my face when I saw Terry Crews haha
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews...... other than that, Meh

8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTogether for the 3rd time... just not quite sure it&#39;s a charm. But I&#39;ll probably watch it anyway. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitagrown ups 3?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitait was a bad movie trailer until Terry Crews shows up....now I really want to see this one.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaHmm... this may actually be different, so long as stupid people don&#39;t insta-like it and ruin for everyone else.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita50 first dates 2 would&#39;ve been better
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews! Sold!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWait, what is this movie about? I&#39;m so confused.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita1.11 Haha
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews LMAO!!!!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaTerry Crews
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaCool.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitashut up and take the razzie!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MuWt2X59fo&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a>. <br><br>Lost my shit.<br><br>Thats about it. 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaI miss the time when adam sandler starred good movies. Maybe Drew Barrymore will save it just like the other movies she did with him (the wedding singer, 50 first dates).
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitadrew barrymore is back wot?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaadam sandler is the white version of tyler perry, stop giving these idiots money
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaNope 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler as Adam Sandler in &quot;Adam Sandler goes to Africa&quot;
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitawhy does this seem like it is going to be a really racist movie?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaPlease……….just…..make it……..stop….
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWow sandler just stop and just forget about the money and just make something good
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MuWt2X59fo&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a> pure gold
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaHappy Madison: a company renowned for destroying acting careers.<br>Your time shall soon come, Sandler.<br>Your time shall soon come.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaWhenever I feel hatred towards a Drew Barrymore film I just think about Donnie Darko.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaSo... this is their 51st date?
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like it sucks
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaThis is like that south park episode where that robot writes over 2,000 movies that star adam sandler 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaOh god PLEASE NO
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaplease be funny Adam, PLEASE!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAt least there is no Rob Schneider.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaLooks stupid 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaA movie where adam needs to spend more time with his kids then need&#39;s a wife mhm never seen this b4
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ this has to be the worst movie /trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. I love adam sandler really I do, but his movies are god awful. I will bet $1,000,000 that his movie will be utter garbage and a big flop in the box office.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaafter all the shitty movies that Adam have made in the past few years...DREW BARRYMORE came back to save his ass.....LEGEN....waitforit.....DARY!.....
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaHA. They were both the main character in &quot;50 First Dates&quot;. (: <br>This looks funny..
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitanice to see the Mandela interperater could still get work as a safari guide
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaPlease no more sandler movies
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaDr. Shakalu!
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaThis looked so terrible until TERRY CREWS 
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler and Drew Barrymore together again.
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaThis looks absolutely horrendous...
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitastop giving adam sandler money to make movies
8MuWt2X59fodelimeterByIshitaFirst
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita26% on Rotten Tomatoes, what a stinkeroo
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita2020corona
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThere was an animated Barbie and the Three Musketeers made in 2009, it seems to have been a great inspiration for this movie.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie b/c of Mads Mikkelsen🔥
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI wish there&#39;s a Part 2 for this.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaJames corden made this movie so much better.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaTo be honest, I only watched it because of Christoph Waltz.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThe residence in Würzburg with the biggest fresco in the world!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaCooooooooooooooooool
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI actually enjoyed this movie. I cant believe it is hated
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI think it is sad that so many people hate this movie because it&#39;s not like the book, but I think that makes it outstanding. There are so many movies about the musketeers and all are almost the same. I really liked it.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaLOL
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaVery good classical stuff right here it goes way back in my life in pup series every character was remade really good this is a good film classics
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaok but Logan Lerman is very fine😏
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaIs there any CGI in this?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaAfter all those time I saw this movie, I just realized now that Mads Mikkelsen played Rochefort, oh my god.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWait.. I realized Milla Jovovich was Joan of Arc and Alice
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhen is the next movie coming out 😪👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaOne for all and all for one
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYic5JxgTMc&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a> The Three Musketeers: Matrix edition.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this for the cast...<br><br>...but I&#39;m not sure I could sit through all the bullshit to enjoy them...
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitawhen the second part release any one knows.??
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie, I am hoping for a sequel
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitareally a horrible movie
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaOkay, so they claim to be musketeers, so where are all the muskets??????
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThey got some really good actors to be in this crap.  :P
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaHollywood can make a shit from diamond. Alexandr Duma makes facepulm in his coffin.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaHalah sok tau semua lu pada.. kampang!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitathis looks dumb
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaPaul, we get it. Your wife is hot. Grow up.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaamazing l like it
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI read the book I&#39;m elementary school...but all I remember is d&#39;Artagnan&#39;s pitiful love life.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaSkip this movie, and watch the BBC show The Musketeers, i&#39;ve heard it&#39;s more accurate AND it&#39;s much better written/directed/acted etc :)
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhy was the title &quot;three musketeers&quot; while there were four of them?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaPaul W S Anderson is usually a fun hack---this totally SUCKED!!!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI could only make it thru 20 minutes of this shit
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaCant wait for GI JOE Retaliation,, where Ray Stevenson (Porthos) will fight Dwayne Johnson in a epic film-fight! :D
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThis is so wrong on so many levels. Like seriously, why don&#39;t they just take a crap on the book and then make a movie of it? Hell, it&#39;d probably be better than this garbage. 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaJust saying... Logan Lerman and Orlando Bloom in the same movie.... I know its gonna be nothing like the book.... but I&#39;m going to enjoy it anyway....
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@AotearoaSoldier17 You&#39;re crazy, everyone loves celebrities.
It all started because I said he was HOT, let me love him and shut up, bye
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@AotearoaSoldier17 I don&#39;t expect him to know me,
I&#39;m not the only one who loves him.
You&#39;re just a disgruntled person.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@AotearoaSoldier17 You don&#39;t even know him,
i&#39;m in love with that guy
I say he&#39;s HOT.
He&#39;s an amazing person, so shut up.
Sorry if this gets weird, Google Translate ..
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@AotearoaSoldier17 WTF ?
Shut up
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

If you want we can make conversasion but not here...With message ;)
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

The translate said that you said me go to hell...
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

Εγώ το κατάλαβα απο τον τρόπο που το είπες...Τέλος πάντων, δεν θέλω να μαλώνουμε άλλο, για εμένα η συζήτηση έχει λήξει...Μπορώ να σου πω και εγώ να χρησιμοποιήσεις τον μεταφραστή αλλα έτσι δεν θα καταλαβαινόμαστε.
Αντίο.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

You dont like Jews and Black people, i can undestand that very well, also i can undestand that you dont have  high education because you constantly insult without reason. And you jealous America and Jews because the are well developed countrys and people not like Serbia, thats a problem ;)
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

I fuck you and your racist Serbia ;)

Greetings.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

Serbia? I am Jew...You and your Serbia have a problem? YOU FUCKING RACIST! 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

I was SURE that you are Russian. 1st, I am not American, i am Israeli. And second, wy you guys dont like Americans?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 

Fuck YOU!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaflying boats ?! Really ?! XD
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it so awful to see a story altered? I happen to like airships - whether they would really work or not - when combined with swashbuckling adventurer-types. I understand it isn&#39;t faithful to the original story, but there&#39;s worse thinsg in the world than that. Christ.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaOrlando Bloom is so hot
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 You&#39;re talking about people who play this movie?
Sorry if I wrote a funny, Google Translate.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThis is a joke. Of course Hollywood would make a badass assassin into a female during this time period. RIGHT.... last time I checked an assassin is described as being in peak human physical condition and athleticism being capable of performing great feats of acrobatics and much more. This &quot;assassin girl&quot; is skinny as a thread of hay. Push her off an 8 story building and she&#39;d break her damn legs. AND REALLY!? REALLY?! A LEAP OF FAITH @0:58!? Ezio Auditore will kill yall thieving bastards... 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@hunkatiel The Four Musketeers is just the rest of the Three Musketeers. The were originally going to make one film but had enough material for two. The actors were so pissed off that most film contracts now have a Salkind (after the producer) clause to prevent this from happening again. The Return of the Musketeers is a sequel based on the Dumas novel Twenty Years After.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@jiffinbigles You think that is bad. The 1973/74 version had a French actor as King Louis, he had to put on an English accent. It hurts me head to think of it now.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@TheStarbunnie Have you seen the 1973 and 1974 films? Charlton Heston as the Cardinal...And Oliver Reed as Oliver Reed - I mean Athos and Raquel Welch and Faye Dunaway in a cat fight. However the 1993 verson does have Charlie Sheen, well played.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 ejqfqewutewofefjqfqewrjqwrqj qrfpoqwurqt pqopurtyee8fe p9urqepur32 you too!!!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 you must be jealous coz your county cant make films like the US huh? 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaSure, just bolt on a gas bag to a wooden galleon and it will fly. Maybe some great alchemist developed a super lifting gas out of bat farts and that&#39;s why they can fly inspite of being a hundred times too heavy.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@boyentrancers345 at least better than the last pirates &gt;&lt; even though the music seemed to be stolen from hans zimmer v.v 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaBut…where&#39;s the zombies?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaMilla Jovovich seems to be unable to avoid movies with Matrix-esque flips and slides.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaYeah guys remember that part in the book when there&#39;s that huge airship battle. I don&#39;t either there&#39;s nothing from the novel besides some character names!!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@andiivelazquez would you rather he faked the british accent? that would suck.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@drgluck07 
why is that? they still have cool movies
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaah! cool swords!!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@Mazmorrero2 hmm, that was a version from Denmark. Just checking the list on IMDB, there are others like The 4 Musketeers, The Return of the Musketeers, Sons of the Musketeers, Barbie &amp; the Musketeers, cartoons, tv series and other offshoots that would raise that number. Maybe next year it will be Predator 6 vs the Musketeers.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@SilverInsanity 
it was produced in Germany (Bayern)
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@andiivelazquez It&#39;s set in France, though, isn&#39;t it? XP
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitahow to destroy the memory of Roland Dumas....take Paul W.S. Anderson as a director, waiting for the number two with zombies and Milla Jovovich
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaHurray for steampunk.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita&quot;We live in a kingdom controlled by fear&quot;

- sounds like the US....
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaholly fucking shit whats with all the haters maybe the movie will be awesome maybe it will suck but nobody knows because it hasten come out yet, i know that im falling for the old troll act but come on if this movie existed when my grandmother was little people would freak out people would run away screaming and heads would explode, now before the movie even comes out &quot;save yourself the toble of paying for this... its going to be a bad move&quot;. SHUT THE FUCK UP-pulp fiction 1994.  
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitasave yourself the trouble of paying for this... its going to be a bad movie
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell does that guy have an american accent?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@bubbly92c lucky! was the movie good? ahaha pretty nice line up aye ;) 
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@boyentrancers345 i went to see it today. i was there for christoph waltz and freddie fox. ;P
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaIt was an off day ;)
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@hunkatiel i know its an overused plot.. but this looks sick
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck ever happened to originality? I&#39;ll tell ya, it went down the shitter.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaim just here for logan lerman and orlando bloom; they are bangtidy!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitasmells like another epic fail....
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaoh come on really what have you done with the three musketeers at first I was look cool a movie about history but then I saw milla jump off that building sliding ala matrix and flying pirate ships ( hits my head on the desk )
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaGlad to see a steampunk take on a great story.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaI actually don&#39;t mind a little change up in this story,
I mean just look at how often they already made a movie out of this! not even mentioning all the series that did special episodes and stuff. 
it&#39;s not like they&#39;re claiming to be the one right version, they want to be different!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita-_-

god help us all.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@Hugehugo912 Rochefort is seen at 1:21 and 1:34 and the role is played by the danish actor Mads Mikkelsen

TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaТысяча чертей! Каналья!!! ))))
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaБез Боярского хуйня офк.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@hunkatiel Lol.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaNoch nie in meinem Leben schämte ich mich für unsere Zeit so sehr wie jetzt. Wie kann man so ein tolles Buch blos so schwachsinnig verfilmen? Wieso muss man den Namen verwenden, der ein Buch representiert, und kein Final Fantasy? Eine einzige Enttäuschung. Weniger als Film, sondern vielmehr als Film nach einem Buch :(
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitais there nothing sacred???!!!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaThe 3 musketeers movies:  1903, 1911, 1914, 1916, two movies in 1921, 1933, 1935, 1939, 1948, 1953, 1957, 1961, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1993, 2005, 2011.
Great to see those Hollywood screen writers coming up with new ideas for films.
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita1:21 awesome
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell has d&#39;Artagnan got an American accent?
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshitaquiero verlaaa!
TYic5JxgTMcdelimeterByIshita@Hugehugo912 I believe that Rochefort is seen at 1:21, but that might not be so, just a guess...

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThat part where you go on quest to conquer your crush, who&#39;s out of your league. But you become such a man who is now far out of her league.

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaPuttukatho luchhanakodukulu office rumors. Conjuring inn
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaI really enjoyed this and The Secret of Moonacre as a kid. I&#39;d dream about these when I was 12/13 and, when I grew older, I wondered if I had actually seen the movies or if they were only dreams. I&#39;m 24 now and the last couple of years after school haven&#39;t been so good which is why I like to revisit my childhood through music, films and memories. Hope it&#39;ll get better but, in the meantime, I&#39;ll look at these moments from my childhood/early teen years.

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful film. Loved it.
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaI sincerely don&#39;t understand why this movie is not more well known. It&#39;s fantastic and easily fits into my top ten favorite movies ever.💜💜💜
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaClassic!
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie , I wish they made more movies like these
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThis isn’t the stardust I was looking for<br>What is this
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThis is what happens when you cross The Princess Bride with Midnight Run. Such an awesome film
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaA slightly darker version of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and I have watched both many times.  I am not a big fan of De Nero but he was fantastic in this movie.  Mark Strong delivers (as ALWAYS) and personnaly, he was my favorite character.  One of my favorite scenes is when he consults with the soothsayer the second time.  Good Stuff.  Michelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous and I thnk she is one of the all time great beauties in cinema.  Good story line and just enough action.  One of the things that stuck out to me was the music and sound.  Not that I thought the music was anything special, but the sound LEVEL stayed consistent and doesn&#39;t blare between conversations or in action/fighting scenes like many movies do. One of the funniest things I found in the film is that I somehow mistook Claire Danes for Gwyeneth Paltrow the first time I watched it. 😂 Overall a great movie and I give it 👍👍👍👍.
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaMy childhood....
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaHow come I never realized Tristan was Daredevil?! My childhood is shaking
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh, I can&#39;t believe I found the trailer again!!! Although I&#39;ve never seen the actual movie, I&#39;ve remembered different scenes from this trailer since I watched it as a little kid - but I could never place the movie title!!

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaDon’t need to see the film now the trailer show the whole movie
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThanks for posting this.  Holy crow, what a terrible trailer... I&#39;m assuming this is why the film bombed domestically??  Too bad, it&#39;s a really great film!
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wwv427DAvA&amp;t=0m39s">0:39</a> did they really use Dimmu Borgir, a black metal band, in their family friendly movie trailer? I approve of that.<br>Song is called &quot;Eradication Instincts Defined&quot;

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie holds special meaning to me. There was a movie theater I went to all the time growing up and worked at as a usher when I was in high school. It closed down a year after I graduated college and this was the last movie I saw there before it closed.

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching this, and I can definitely say, as a longtime fan of fantasy, that Stardust is one of the best fantasy movies that I&#39;ve ever watched. It was a fantastic ride from beginning to end. I cannot recommend this masterpiece enough!! 10/10

-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaThis was uploaded 3 years ago and I&#39;m the first person to comment about this trailer containing an excerpt from a Dimmu Borgir song. The world has fallen off course.
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitamad to think i saw this at 7 years old and now i watch him in Daredevil lmao
-wwv427DAvAdelimeterByIshitaI was three years old when this came out

fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitalast time I checked Pete&#39;s dragon was a English movie
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI prefer Toothless.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaclay davis sighting!! <br><br>sheeeeettt!!!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPOamb6d_20&amp;t=1m57s">1:57</a> he sounds like donald trump<br>
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaPassamashoddy
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaOh man, Sony is finally releasing The Last Guardian
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe happiest home in these HILLS!!!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThat looks like a fying dog, not a dragon.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know.. I dont&#39; care whether Elliot has fur or scales..  my problem is he looks out of place. Too cartoonish...like they didn&#39;t spend much time getting the CG perfect.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis looks kind of ridiculous.  What worked about the original is that it didn&#39;t take itself too seriously.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitashiiiiiiiiit
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWhy people would complain about a dragon, a fantasy creature, being fluffy and cuddly instead of scaly is beyond me.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaMan I can&#39;t believe how much this movie wants to be the new How To Train Your Dragon movie
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaReminds me of &quot;the water horse&quot; movie. Anyone else??
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaHere we go again when man doesn&#39;t understand something it must die
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitafucking awful
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaMy birthday is August 12th
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI thought it looked stupid at first, but I might see it if it reviews well.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaYou can&#39;t say &quot;Dragon&quot; over the radio!! love thisss
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita&quot;Dragon! It&#39;s a Dragon!&quot; Lol
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaLooks better than Eragon........
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitalooks better than the other trailer
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaOne of the two: Or the dragon dies or he set it free and possibly never see it again. Either way, I will not like the end :c
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the name of the music? It&#39;s so beautiful.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe FX have me worried.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaIF CLIFFORD WAS A BIG GREEN DRAGON, IRON GIANT PLOT
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaMan, How To Train Your Dragon 3 looks amazing.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaNot sure what I want more, a raptor pack or a dragon.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitathey are not nice
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S A DRAGON! &quot;WE CAN SAY &quot;DRAGON&quot; OVER THE RADIO!&quot; KKKKKKKKK
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitawhy the fuck does it have fur dragons have scales its a winged lizard not a fire breating bat
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaBig fluffy dragon ♥
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaLooks lame.. Original was more family oriented.  This looks like its gonna ruin the whole Elliot is a shy nice dragon image.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe dragon looks more catlike then lizardlike.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI need to farm 5 of those for my armor set. Got my tranq bombs and shock traps ready. Let&#39;s go hunting...
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe jungle book kid doing Tarzan things while learning how to train his dragon.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaBryce Dallas Howard must have a thing for reptiles.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaDisney presents the Iron Giant again :)
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaZack snyder should have directed this movie. dammit
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis sucks. Just ruined my favorite dragon!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita@oakesfegley is so adorable
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis just looks like a live action good dinosaur
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis looks Cool, I&#39;m the 5,105th person to see this.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaTalk about making a good impression Disney!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWhy do this? Just name is something else. It&#39;s clearly not Pete&#39;s Dragon. Sure, Elliott could have another boy, fine. But don&#39;t call it Pete&#39;s Dragon because it&#39;s not. Enough &quot;reinvisioning&quot; Disney. Get a new idea. 😡
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWhy fur dragon??? Why not a normal dragon
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitatoothless...toooothless!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe town this takes place in better be called Passamaquoddy
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m never going to see that kid as anything other than Samaritan...
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitayesyesyes awesome! :D
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaReminded me of E.T for some reason
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita&quot;That dragon&#39;s not the law, I am the law.&quot;
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaDamn Rhaegal really let him self go.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaCan someone please get me a dragon please. Thanks.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaPete&#39;s Dragon was one of my favourites as a kid and now as an adult (if I&#39;m even there yet lol) but this looks awesome! I love the kid playing Pete (he does kinda look like the original so gotta love that) but who in hell is the little girl???
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaMagnificent.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitathe dragon looks out of place
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThat man who Said &quot;Let&#39;s go hunting&quot;, is from &quot;Star Trek: Beyond&quot;
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaLooks like a cross between How to Train Your Dragon and The Iron Giant xD
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaOld ppl start complaining about Pete and cgi
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI get &quot;Super 8&quot; vibe from the trailer, which is a good sign
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaIn your face Khalesi!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitai think that Eliot would look better with scales
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPOamb6d_20&amp;t=01m13s">01:13</a> Mockingjay Part 2 SONG 😍
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaI feel like this cgi looks a little dated.... it&#39;s probably just unfinished and their still working on the final product.... I thought the same thing about the BFG
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis looks great! It doesn&#39;t look like Pete&#39;s Dragon other than &quot;boy and dragon,&quot; but it looks promising for what it is.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaOkay, I&#39;ll be honest: after the first trailer I was super mad that Elliot wasn&#39;t a 2D creature like the original. But after seeing this, I think I just got over it.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaLooks great! A little disappointed we won&#39;t be seeing a more modern version of Doc Terminus, though...
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaNice
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWow. This actually looks pretty great.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWell. That doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t look anything like the movie it shares its title with...
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaJEEZ how much money do I have to save for the movie theaters?! This is insane 😵 so many movies coming up!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaIt seems that Disney is returning to its roots. And it looks magical! :)
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitathanks Disney for fucking up yet another already awesome movie with a  watered down cheap version of the original...
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitayep its TEN times better than the original already....the original was crap. This is actually something good.<br>Except for the weird &quot;Tarzan&quot; kid story...not sure why they made it like that for. But I think it works....
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaaw 😍, me encantó. Agosto 😉
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaAwwwww I was hoping it would have the tiny wings like the original!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThe fact that Elliott is all fury and fuzzy in this instead of scaly reptilian skin like pretty much every dragon we&#39;ve ever seen makes no sense but this movie does look kinda good.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaIt looks like a really good movie!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThey made Eliot look like a dog because we are more connected to pets and they wanted us to feel that connection, and also in the original he doesn&#39;t look like a normal dragon.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPOamb6d_20&amp;t=1m59s">1:59</a> shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThey added fur all over, but they took out the pink tuft of hair on top of the dragon&#39;s head. Disney why are you teaching kids that only the fuzzy wuzzy animals deserve love? No amphibians, birds, or reptiles in Zootopia and now Pete&#39;s DRAGON more closely resembles a big green dog with wings.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitalooks awesome man
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWe need a live action Hunchback of Notre Dame remake ASAP.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaWell... At least they got his main colour correct.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaEveryone who wants one, has a Dragon to protect them. :)
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPOamb6d_20&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a> i thought of the walking dead music lmao
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitafree willy?
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis movie will still be another critical and box office hit for Disney. That&#39;s for sure. I can&#39;t wait to see more of what the director of this movie does for Disney, because we know Disney loved what the director did with this movie so much, that they hired him to write and direct an upcoming &quot;Peter Pan&quot; remake, which will hopefully be better than the awful &quot;Pan&quot; from 2015.
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis looks insane!! Got goosebumps
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThey better not kill the dragon at the end. 😭😭😭
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitalooks cool but why does it have fur i would think as dragons are thought of as more reptilian it would have scales instead
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaThis kid is so cute ☺️
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaHow to Train Pete&#39;s Dragon
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitalooks awesome!
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaAWESOME
fPOamb6d_20delimeterByIshitaGood !
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaemily looks olddd!!!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitahappy 12th birthday!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWhat if Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis aren&#39;t the same guy and Bruce Willis is a Jumper who wants to kill Joseph?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshita&quot;oh my god&quot;
OH YEAH BABY
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaClearly they are the same movies because they are movies.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitavery original, i hope they do mess it up
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m seek of trailers wihi dubstep!!!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely looks sick. but what&#39;s even cooler is that apparently JGL would record Bruce Willis doing some of his line&#39;s in the script and then play them on repeat on his iPod so that he could get Willis&#39; voice just right... if you notice he sounds just like a younger bruce willis. 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good.  I love Joseph and Bruce.  Looking forward to seeing this.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitai was wondering why they made JGL look different but then i realised it was so he could look like Bruce Willis =\
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaAre jumper, push, and looper based in the same world?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaFinally a good looking movie!  I cant wait to see this.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitalooks great, the idea is smart and refreshing
love how he will kill him even if its himself, thats real professionalism
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it going to be cool. i wanna see it
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitadubstep is all over the place tv movie trailers and even game trailers as well.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitawow...you must not have seen many films huh?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t compare inception to this movie.....inception is the best movie ever made.....this is just another bullshit,
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaIdiot, they are talking about cinematography &amp; style, in which ways they are linked. 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaStill continues to be such a cool fucking premise, but each time I watch a new trailer all I ever focus on is how fucking good Gordon-Levitts Willis make up is! Oh my god he looks so much like him wtf!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitacan we talk about mindfuck... or how fucking sexy joseph gordon-levitt looks! :O
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI think Edward Norton woulda been a better Bruce Willis. 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitawait so if Bruce Willis is Joseph Gordan Levitt does that mean that he would remember everything that is going on then like him having to kill himself and that stuff but wouldnt it be like a big loop because now both a Levitt/Willis person is like in the same time zone and see and talk to each other, so wouldnt they make a time paradox or something? ....Back to the Future help me out please on this logic. But this movie does look interesting and I&#39;ll for sure watch it.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaso because inception had levitation of furniture and character flips from right side up to upside down, other movies that have levitation of furniture and character flips from right side up to upside down as well are ripping off inception? how logical..... -_-
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaEver since it started to get more mainstream. lol &quot;real music&quot;. If you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s fine, but that&#39;s just ignorant.
 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think it&#39;s Inception-inspired, as much as Inception-esque. It gives off a similar vibe, you know? Like they&#39;re cut from the same cloth of sci-fi.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitais this trailer made by EA Games!? so much for the DUB Step
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaLooks ok.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitawhos doctor who?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaikr
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitai might see this, looks ok.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaits just that they all are very confusing and the goverment does stuff
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWho ever cut this trailer together needs to be fired for ineptitude. 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitasince when is dubstep better in movie trailers than REAL MUSIC
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie defies all of the rules of time travel I&#39;ve learned from science and Doctor Who.
Such as:
If you go back in time and meet yourself/touch yourself, then a paradox is created that destroys the universe. I also think that that includes kicking the shit out of yourself.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThe future is black! lol
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitayou know, confusing. i can see it now, the ending having an even more brain twisting, mind bending ending then inception, weither it works out well, then 30 years later ends up 30 years earlyer and its just a circuler pattern forever!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s the soundtrack that is confusing people
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitahow?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitainception 2?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll say it. I love the dubstep in the trailer. What of it!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI really want this movie to be great!!!!! i just can&#39;t stop watching the trailer 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitathat was a real shitty attempt there....

diapper = FAIL!

(it&#39;s diaper, btw)
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaBang!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard + Looper = diapper 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitabullshit! how do you know?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitayes it really did
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitathe way joseph gordon-levvit is made to look like bruce willis is just awesome!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWell the Dub -step literally ruined the trailer.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaMusic It&#39;s Called Fight For Fredom by Jack Trammell also availble On iTunes!!! 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaSweet.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWub wub wub
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitamaybe its just under control of time machine...
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI agree, what has this to do with inception *shaking my head* 
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitano.. your face looks backwards
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWow must see
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI love how people are referencing Inception or saying that this is Inception inspired, even though the movies have a totally different premise. Inception was about going into people&#39;s dreams and planting an idea. Looper is about assassinating people who come back in time, and then him having to assassinate himself. Someone even referenced In Time, which has a different premise as well. Uhh..Wtf?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitalol, same dubstep music as in the Alex Cross trailer! Dubstep FTW?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t that the kid from &quot;third rock from the sun&quot;?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitawhat i dont understand is how they time travel its bs thats not real im going back to watch ufo shows on the history channel now those are real.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaYou are right! I know... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of Dreamscape though, I will check it out... thanks!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaOh you know, inception is not the first movie of this kind :) Inception actually cloned Dreamscape and a lot of other sources :)
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThere are not suppose to look a like - there&#39;s a 30 years difference between them people faces change a bit. i agree if it was only 10 years you would have been right.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks VERY good...
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaJGL looks so weird
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaAnother Inception-&quot;inspired&quot; movie? I hope this is a good one, but I am afraid it doesn&#39;t look like it. One previous attempt at cloning it (&quot;In Time&quot;) was stylish but meh.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaHe will be killing the future self who traveled back in time to be killed by the past self who is living in the present time, get it? But then he would&#39;ve never died in the future anymore because he knows that he will be sent back and he will try to alter his, if you will, &quot;fate&quot;. That&#39;s the problem with being able to look into the future, because once you see the future, it will never be the same anymore. Anyway, I&#39;m no scientist, just my two cents... :D
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaawesome trailer. But ENOUGH with dubstep in trailer
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitamusic from total recall trailer :(
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaProps for the skrillex nod. &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWUB WUB WUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaLooking at JGL like that is a total mindfuck
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitafuck yes
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaCharice Here Comes the boom
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaDual P90s. Badass.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitano die hard +inception+ the dark kinght rises=Looper!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaHoly fuckin shit.....................
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaYep. Gonna see it.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThe makeup makes him look like a completely different person. More like Brice Willis. I guess that&#39;s the point.
 
The movie looks great. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing Looper.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshita¡LOL Look at his nose!

2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaSo he&#39;ll be killing his future self in the past?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaBecause fight club totally has time travelling assassins.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitagod damn I hate time travel paradox&#39;s, if he kills himself in the past, how can he exist in the future in order to kill his past self??
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaAgreed. I&#39;m still like. O.o lol
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it how JGL looks like this.. He is so different, lol.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck are you talking about? This looks awesome
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitabased on a true story
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitalooks cool, accept for the shit dup step and Battle field 3 noise at the end haha
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitanot until he lives &#39;til the point in his life where he gets captured and sent back to the past to be killed by himself
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaso if he kills himself then he doesn&#39;t exist?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitajudgement day has arrive i want to see that movie i think to see more joseph gordon levitt senstitive films he&#39;s a natural cool to meet and hanson guy to hang out with.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaWell actually i think that JGL has a different apperance on his look and emily blunt is very sexy eyes.bruce willis Joe play it off.
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaEmily Blunt looks as sexy as ever. I love Rian Johnson and JGL, but dubstep, seriously?
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshitaThe first trailer was better. But DAMN I want to see this movie so bad &gt;.&lt;
2iQuhsmtfHwdelimeterByIshita5th

9ItBvH5J6ssdelimeterByIshitaFIRST! -John
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSaw it last night, great movie!  I felt bad for Christian Bale&#39;s character towards the end, he genuinely cared for the mayor who to me seemed like a pretty stand-up guy, and eventually told him of the operation
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaCome on 10 oscar nods seriously? I remember a time when movies that got 10 oscar nominations were memorable.. this movie was good.. nothing great, tries too hard to be funny, especially jennifer lawrence&#39;s character. Really overrated. good but not deserving of so much praise and awards..
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita10 Oscar Nominations, I think it will get sizeable awards. Good Luck.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what&#39;s the name of the 2nd music featured in this trailer? Thanks*
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaReally over rated , too much humor ... for crime movie and I&#39;m not looking for &quot; snappy Dialogue &quot; but Realism .
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaoverrated movie, still good though
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita&#39;dont repeat that.but yes&#39;
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita@ECKohns has the best comment ever.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI love Jennifer Lawrence so much,she looks super hot in this film woow
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI had come to have high expectations after Russell&#39;s last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was EMOTIONALLY INVESTED, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the ELECTRIC energy, the rockin&#39; soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitathere was like no action but it has this incredible soundtrack and great overlapping narration that makes it one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen in a long time. This movie captures the 70&#39;s so so amazingly well its like you go back in time. The only bad part is (SPOILERS) what happens to Carmine, he really was the only &quot;good guy&quot; in the movie
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was very disappointing.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song in this trailer?
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitai wanted this film to end so bad, it dragged on for far too long and got very boring. overrated as hell.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI Love Amy Adams
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaChristian Bale is awesome in this movie!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaiwannawatchitnow. com great site thanks. working. just started to watching american hustle
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaamerican hustle rocks! watched it at iwannawatchitnow. com
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitagreat work iwannawatchitnow. com awesome movie
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaamerican hustle rocks! watched it at iwannawatchitnow. com
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitabale could pull a steve jobs double
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitafucking louis ck
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaboring rip off. bring a pillow.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita i wanna see this movie  SO BAD and OMG christian bale i LOVE HIM SO MUCH
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaGREAT, GREAT movie. Only thing I didn&#39;t like about it, It need more Jeremy Renner! That guy was phenomenal in this movie! Check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it. 
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song in the trailer
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSometimes trailers show too much
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI saw this film today and thought it was awesome!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie I have a seen in quite a while.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaRubbish just watched it.i want 2hours of my life back please
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s that song called in the second half of the trailer???
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitathe whole film is about which actor  does  the best Robert De Nino  doing a Italian /American accent ...just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t believe the hype, only thing good about this film is Amy Adams cleavage.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI lost 2 and a half hours of my life wwatching this film
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThis has got my favorite actress in Jennifer Lawrence 
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThat moment when you realize that Bradley coopers boss was Louis ck the whole time yet no one seemed to notice lol
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThe acting was fabulous!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaIs Bradley Cooper meant to look that ridiculous?
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI can see why people might find this movie boring but I personally loved it. You have to really pay attention to it and watch it as a movie, pay attention to the writing, the preformances, the direction, and as a movie this is a pretty damn good movie
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaBoring movie.i don&#39;t know why people think its interesting?
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaMost boring dil
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaits amazing
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSaw it last night, The most BORING thing i have ever seen!! I want 2 hours of my life back and also my money would be good..Cheers
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty boring.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita defo going to watch this bc Jennifer Lawrence
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll have to admit, this movie looks like boring shit
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSeveral Jeff Lynne (ELO)&#39; songs in the movie!!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a Great Film with superb performances all around. It was funny, serious and everything you want from David O&#39; Russell. There was a Great cameo by DeNiro and he and Bale played beautifully off one another. Speaking of Bale, he was Flawless I loved his Dynamic with Amy Adams who should get a Oscar Nom for this and Jennifer Lawrence who was fabulous in her small role. I also loved Bradley Cooper he took his role and really sunk his teeth into it and again Bale and he were fabulous together. I can&#39;t say enough good about this film.A def must see. Bale should get a Oscar nomination as well. 
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaI can already see it, lawrence the hoochie reports them all and they end up in jail or dead. NEXT!!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s got to be fake tummy for Christian Bale....hahaa...pls...
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie. Anyone who enjoys any of Martin Scorsese&#39;s pictures will likely enjoy this.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaReally amazing movie everyone was on there A game and Jennifer and Amy were so god damn beautiful
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqgjPRNRDSY&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> - onwards - title of the song please? Thanks.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitachristian bale is the only yood thing in this
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence is so beautiful.

NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaAnybody know the second song being played with the horns and strings? Can you see that man running down the streets today? Interesting song.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaOh god those Jennifer Lawrence Boobs
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence does the bonnie and Clyde scene on the bed<br>
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSo beautiful. I&#39;m so excited, does anybody know the first song in this trailer?? 
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaDont  repeat that but yes

NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaSecond song is 10538 Overture by Def Leppard :)
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks fun!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I&#39;m watching this movie is because of Christian Bale!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaJENNIFERRRRRRRR
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaWOW!!! Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence look extremely sexy in this film! Definitely a must-see!
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks extremely good

NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaAnd Louis C.K. who is basically the superhero of modern comedy
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaHaha really. This might be the closest to a Goodfellas/Casino that we&#39;ve seen.
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshita&quot;It&#39;s Not For Me To Say&quot; by Johnny Mathis
NqgjPRNRDSYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it either, but the 70s?

-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaIve never seen so many white people
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaYa you
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a little uncomfortable with Woody Allen&#39;s movies, but this one was good.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaThe most unrealistic thing about this movie is leaving Blake Lively for Kristen Stewart. btw issa joke lads
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI actually rented this film out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised by the writing and performances. Though if I&#39;m honest had I watched this trailer before knowing anything about the film I might&#39;ve passed on it. The movie is solid.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaHis films are so visually beautiful...This looks good to me...
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaBravo! That&#39;s good Cinema, Woody fucking Allen!
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitafirst movie I&#39;ve seen in theaters by myself. good choice. like it a lot
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI cant stand woody Alan. he is a disgusting pervert.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaNo way, Steve carrel is actually in a movie!!! 🙀🙀🙀😮
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaAlso love the music in this one.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who has a crush on Jesse? Don&#39;t answer all at once.😍😍😍
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaYou can see Woody Allen being projected through Jesse Eisenberg. I don&#39;t want to see Woody Allen.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshita&quot;This looks like it could be good...Wait, is that Kristen Stewart? Nevermind.&quot;
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaWoody Allen films are always enjoyable to watch. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still making movies. God bless.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaThese two, Bradley cooper with Jennifer lawrence and Emma stone with Ryan Gosling are always together! Lol love it though ☺️
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI call these 70 degree movies. No one is too hot or too cold or soiled; a weather bubble.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitathis movie should be good.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaHail Luthor?
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitasong? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1yDgVpHH8U&amp;t=0m27s">0:27</a>
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaJessie Eisenberg is a cutie, loved them in American Ultra
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI love Jesse Eisenberg : ) I will definitely watch this movie since every movie Jesse in I would watch !
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1yDgVpHH8U&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> what did she say ? god she looks great in this movie
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaWhat a amazing photography.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI like Woody Allen movie and i like a lot this cast. Can&#39;t wait to see.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaI love Woody Allen movies. I would see this one.
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitaoldies movie plot can always be cool
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshitagood
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshita🙂
-1yDgVpHH8UdelimeterByIshita:)
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOwen Wilson sucks dick...
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThe dude on the cover looks like rex orange county with a beard
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely loved this movie ! Everything about it is phenomenal! But can someone please explain the end <br>Thank you -
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaNamjoon fav film and Taehyung twitter 💜
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaJe n&#39;ai encore jamais vu ce film mais j&#39;ai hate de le voir par contre !<br>Je vois que les commentaires ne sont qu&#39;excellents et en plus de tout : Taehyeong a recréé des scènes de ce film en photographies (donc quel autre signe pour regarder ce film doit on attendre en plus?) 💜
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaSo,that is Namjoon&#39;s favorite movie...mmmm. we should know what geniuses are watching
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaits sooo bootyfull
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitathis is namjoon favorite film ㅠㅠ he brought me here!!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI feel I&#39;m watching a different version of Cindrella Fairy Tale which the same (pumpkin :) car takes the lonely man to his fantasy world (not the only one person) and I love the explanation of the difference between the &quot;painter&quot; and &quot;artist&quot;. By the way, the silver rain of Paris at Christmas time was a great experience for me, too, but the lack of music at streets in real life were disappointing.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitahere bc of lauv&#39;s video ha
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies i ever watched
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaKANG DANIEL RECCOMEND THIS TO ME,  SO HERE I AM
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaim here because Kang Daniel Wanna one :D
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitakang daniel brought me here
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaIs it the movie Kang Daniel recommended to Wannables?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitavery booring movie horseshit
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitatrailer is so bad, but the movie is just amazing
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshita<b>wow</b>
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAll i can think about is WOW lol
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaomg i just remembered I&#39;ve seen this video ages ago when i was much younger, and i didn&#39;t even remember the name, i just stumbled upon it now. its crazy what our minds can remember.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI think that&#39;s why I love the Before Midnight films, cities take on a whole new persona at night, if you don&#39;t get mugged, raped etc you just might have a good time.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitawhy is rachel mcadams in every time traveling romance movies?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a performence by cast 👌
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaGreat Music
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s hiddleston?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaWatching the time traveler&#39;s wife, about time and Midnight in Paris in one go would definitely make it awkward to see Rachel McAdams playing as heroin again and again and again.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaWedding Crashers reunion!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies ever
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite❤🗼
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaHow many movies does Rachel McAdams play in that she&#39;s dating/married to a time traveler?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI like to think of this as a sequal to Wedding Crashers
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie EVER
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaPlease make more movies like this...
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAny similar movie recommendations? 😄
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOwen, I felt code in this movie to help me. Adriana...from another time<br> Other stuff too, like going back to a safer, cooler, better time. I like Owen in this
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis might be the most pleasant movie ever made, a must see.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitamy mother was a serious movie watcher ,she didn&#39;t like a lot of comedies. she hated owen Wilson,couldn&#39;t stand him.  until she saw this movie,she completely changed her views on owen Wilson and respected him
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer does not do the film justice!!  It&#39;s one of my favorite movies but the trailer makes it seem so boring.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaTaehyung taste in movies is 🔥it looks promising defiantly gonna watch it know
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaPicturesque Setting.<br>Brilliant concept.<br>Magnificent music.<br>Wondrous characters.<br>Memorable dialogue. <br>Splendid shades of golden cinematography that harmonize with the theme of the movie:  We think another era was the &quot;golden age.&quot;
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie, so creative and different, it made me so happy!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThe ending of this movie was fucking wack
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitathis movie was phenomenal
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitathis movie makes me want to fall in love again.... and makes me want to go to Paris
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThank you for this masterpiece Woody Allen!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitathis is still my favourite movie after several years. such a creative concept set in a beautiful city. magic
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaParis ! The best actress ever !
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThe best trailer! Doesn’t spoil the movie even a bit…
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaLOVE THIS MOVIE
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thinks Gil never actually went anywhere and that he just made up all those &quot;at midnight&quot; moments in his head as a result of his use of Valium? Though I have to admit my theory conflicts with the fact that the &quot;spy&quot; never made it back to the present time
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThe role of Adriana in my opinion, it would be better played by Rachel McAdams.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitawouldn&#39;t it be great to get away from the era that brought us michael bay and the current monstrosity that is the DCEU, and go back to a time where artists were fueled by passion and not corporate greed, and they all just hung out in paris and critiqued each others work
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaevery movie with owen wilson is in it makes me think of lightning mcqueen 😓😏
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaALL THE ACTORS 10/10
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis is a very well made trailer. It doesn&#39;t spoil anything but pls don&#39;t get fooled cause this movie may surprise you with its plot story.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaparis before isis got to it. =(
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitasaw this movie last night. this trailer revealed nothing too pertinent! brilliant. indeed &quot;what wixardry is this!?&quot;
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie.  I&#39;ve watched it more than 10 times. I&#39;m a female version of Gill. I to prefer Paris in the 20
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI realised Rachel McAdams played in this and immediately thought &quot;this movie has to be good&quot;
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitamusic in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAfR8omt-CY&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a> please?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is talking deeply to the heart of my heart. It is so similar Woody Allen&#39;s thinking to mine! This person Gil Pender... ... its me!  In some interview Woody Allen says that he secondly picked this Californian actor for the part of the writer... but he is amazing. He is deep to a writer&#39;s personality. The success of the movie owes 50% to himself.  He is a very good actor. We can see no sex scenes on this movie... but the whole movie is so much erotic. The plan when both 2 protagonists are dancing is superb! You can feel they are so much in love. And of course Paris. It is difficult to describe Paris. But W. Allen succeeded. At the end, the writer has finally landed on Reality. But he chose the reality of his preference, where he can find a girl more close to his heart. He finds himself and where he wants to be.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaIt was interesting... it was like night at the museum meets back to future with a slight romance novel lol. I dont know how to word it but it was definitely unique. Definitely not your typical romance plot.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie surprised me in many ways. Certainly a must-watch!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t expecting  all those artists in the movie, it really took me by surprise the main plot of this movie. A bravo to Allen one of my favs.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaNever have I ever been so disappointed with the misleading of a trailer. Absolutely upsetting.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI like this so much more!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaSPOILERS !!!<br><br><br>Im not sure I get the ending. So the girl at the end, whom Gil followed home. Did she also use the travel-wagon to travel back in time to date Gil? Because the girl at the end was abit mystic.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitawe need more movie like this
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll check this movie out again since the horrifying massacre in Paris was in the night of Friday the 13th, Nov. &#39;15.  To me it&#39;s bad luck to be superstitious, right folks?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaStill in love with this movie. &lt;3
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who hates Paris? I&#39;ve been there many times and I honestly think it sucks! The people have such &#39;thin&#39;, judgmental personalities, and yeah the Eiffel tower looks great at night but that&#39;s its only good thing.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOne of my all time favourites
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaa movie trailer that doesnt give away the entire movie plot ?! what wizardry is this!
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaDo you think Owen Wilson impersonation of Woody Allen is spot on?
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaA very good film
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite of all the movies! 😄👍🏻💖🇫🇷
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaI need to watch this movie. O.O
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaWhen I was younger, I had my palm read and the person told me that I would find the love of my dreams in Paris, France... I always wanted to go to Paris, France, but when she said that, I wanted to go more than ever! 
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaugh this trailer is so bad the movie is actually really good :)
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaM. C.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshita
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies ever made - a true master piece Woody Allen is a genius
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaMASTERPIECE
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaactor from Star Trek Into the Darkness so must see and I am in paris since 3 years, but where is Amy Smart, she would be better.

FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaowen wilson ruins everything
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaOoh Carla Bruni and Marion Cotillard.  This looks bad anyway.
FAfR8omt-CYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like fun.  I moved to Paris in &#39;94 and get very annoyed with Hollywood versions of it, but I like Woody Allen, so will try to see this!  
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI would absolutely let Kate Winslet murder me.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaMr. Anderson
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWhy has this been released so lat in the US?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis has already been released in the UK, it&#39;s amazing; go and see it!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie so much one of my favorites
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good movie. You won&#39;t be able to guess what happens. Kate is of course great and Hugo Weaving is really fun. Fans of vintage fashion will have a good time too :-)
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWasnt this last years film
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaExistential question: Can Hugo Weaving even act badly?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitafucking love this movie
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI know it&#39;s a chick flick but fuck this film looks fantastic.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not out in the US
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie! It is very funny and has such a awesome twist!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaMiddle aged woman comes to small town of closed minded people and brings her openmindedness and her daring craft with her, while falling in love with a much younger guy. I swear i&#39;ve seen this before. OH YES, IT WAS CALLED CHOCOLAT.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis is what you get when you don&#39;t settle for sequels.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitai love this movie. another great movie from kate.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaLooks better than I thought
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis... is why Kate Winslet is one of the best actresses ever
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaSeems interesting, and the jokes are just... Haha
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitathis wasn&#39;t released in the us yet...?!! the ending wasn&#39;t my cup of tea but kate winslet looked beautiful

DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitalooks decent hope it pulls a twist and she burns the whole town down and kills everyone
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaFeel like this is gonna be nominated for an Oscar..
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this movie a months ago on streaming 😁
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer seemed like it was ten minutes long.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me of chocolat
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaOmg my life story finally and a movie!!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie.  Good Australian comedy with the drama.  Books good too.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaQue fotografia bonita!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWho else felt woah! at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMEu-1CIB_I&amp;t=0m26s">0:26</a> when they see Amazon Studios :D
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaSr. Smith ?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis is only just being released in September in the US, wow I know they get international movies late but this is a year old.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitacomo assim? assisti esse filme ano passado!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWah winslet you never stops dazzeling me😍
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThat red dress is beautiful! Wish Liam Hemsworth wasn&#39;t in the film. I can&#39;t stand any of the Hemsworth brothers.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThat woman does not age.  She&#39;s like a fine wine.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitatoo many cigarettes
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitalooks terrible
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitawtf? i ve seen it already
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaTrailer is good but the movie sucks! Spoiler:...<br>...<br>Her solution in the end is not to flourish, be happy or learn to communicate better, but no, it was to <b>burn the entire village down</b>. Uhm, awesome! I&#39;ve just watched &quot;making of a psychopath&quot;. Seriously, only watch this if your idea of dealing constructively with life&#39;s problems and people being stupid is revenge that is far worse than everything you ever had to experience. Does nobody see anything wrong with that nowadays?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis is on sky tv in the uk.... Stunning/funny/brilliant film....
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis movie came out a while ago.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWild guess, she didn&#39;t actually murder anyone. Crazy twist, I know
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI fell like I read something very similar to this was this movie based off a book
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitawatched this on sky today. its really good!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshita&quot;Murderer and a lesbain&quot; lmao that line alone made me want to watch the movie now
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaHow Did Amazon be able to afford her, probably paying her in installments. Secondly this movie is just way too white for me I&#39;ll pass.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThe second half of this film is fucking ridiculous.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThe last scene of this movie is so awesome, it&#39;s seems like a bad movie, but once you watch it really isn&#39;t, it&#39;s just something different
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaUmm... trailer seems pretty delayed. The movie&#39;s been out for ages.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitathis was released already... it&#39;s actually a good movie
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaKate is back, yeah

DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaWants to be feministic, but got an anti feministic undertone
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaAAAAAAND thats the whole movie. Wow so ima give it a 6/10 well at least they tried.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaand people say looks don&#39;t matter....
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaamazon have a studio?  what&#39;s next? Google making a movie?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaThis was such a great movie!!☺️
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaa murderer and a Lesbian.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitahow is that kid kissing kate winslet
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI highly recommend this movie. One of the best I&#39;ve ever seen. Kate Winslet is everything, Judy Davis is superb.
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s Thor Wears Prada?  Is that it?
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome..  it makes you laugh and cry,😘😍
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitameh
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitaI hope this is as good as it looks. I like remakes, but it&#39;s nice to see an original idea. Something new and unknown!
DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitawait, amazon in a australian movie!?

DMEu-1CIB_IdelimeterByIshitafirst
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI so that and it was cool
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI automatically judged twilight because of vampires. was it really that bad?
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI know this is the internet, where spelling and grammer don&#39;t matter, but seriously... 
Why post a comment if no one can read it?
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this over at watchmoviesonpc. com

Megan is truly a fox!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitalol this isnt only horror it is also comedy because 
i will finish you if i have to

ok... you can barely finish gym class lol i loved the way she said that!! lol
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaWhoever wrote the script for this movie is an idiot. What an awful idea.. maybe it would have been cool in the 90&#39;s...
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathe movie was bad ass you have to see it
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathis movie gonna suck but megan fox is way hot so i don&#39;t give a fuck lol
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathat blond girl was in mean girls.... wow she&#39;s still in high school...?
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathis movie is horrible as in just plain BAD
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaYOU ASS!!!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitawowo this movie suck but cool ending
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaIMDB said it sucked, but that line, &quot;I go both ways&quot; is funny. She also doesn&#39;t seem evil in the high school. The fake boob chick  in &quot;misery business&quot; is the one I think of that seems evil.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaHate Megan Fox.. Loved The Movie.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaa few of my friends went to go see it, they said it was a shitty movie, but megan fox and that other girl like lip fucked for a good 3 mins straight lol. Thats 10$ well spent in my opinion xD
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitamy friend and i snuck into this :D

C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaomg its a porn sight!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was pretty much the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It didn&#39;t live up to the hype and they showed all the best parts in the previews! If you wanna watch it look for it online instead of wasting your money.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaTwo things:
1. oliverpen2 is obsessed with Megan Fox a little too much.

2.This movie is gonna rasie less hell than hellrasier,and hellrasier sucks really bad........so so so bad.

C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaSilly. At best.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaFUN PEOPLE NEEDED (more girls would be nice)  to fill up a NEW Startup Social Network. If you want to join message me.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaMovies are all about entertainment. This movie isn&#39;t going to win an Academy Award but, hot chick, blood, horror - ROCKS !
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitadumb.

I thought this movie would totally sucks but I guess I&#39;m wrong
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitahope so =D
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaSince it&#39;s rated R...does it mean we get to see Megan&#39;s boobys??
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitawell considering jigsaw is a cancer infected quadriplegic.. Prob megan fix
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaDoes Megan Fox really use Acai?

meganfoxsecret com
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitano i cant stand her so i dont think its harsh
-she cant act
and
- shes hot in the same way as a stripper or porn star
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitai cant stand the talentless empty shell of blow up doll ness that is megan fox
but id go see this since amanda seyfried aparenly kicks her ass
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaWell I guess it was only a matter of time until she played the role thats just as slutty as she looks.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshita&quot;I go both ways&quot; that line has convinced me on going!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaman, u guys are obsessed! yes, shes gorgeous but this movie looks god aweful!! but im going for megan fox, girl on girl kissing and violence!!! XD
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafuck you thats my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitalisten im not a kid eye director. im 13 TEENAGER. you can go fuck yourself dumbass
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathats my wife dud
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitadont say that about my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafuck you dont talk like that about my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaZOMG WHO WOULD MAKE HER DO THIS MOVIE?

*sobbing*

Oh my feelins.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitamegan fox is an over rated person who needs to get over herself.this movie looks so cheesy.with its horrible acting.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaMegan Fox... thats y im gonna see this movie
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathats my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafuck you
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaomg megon fox!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI would crack Magan Fox&#39;s seat hard!!!!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaPfft honostly, who&#39;s going to go see this for a horror movie or megan foxes acting, im sure if i go see it i wont be lol :D
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaMan, did you even read the comment at all? I said I&#39;m not jealous, because there&#39;s nothing to be jealous of.

Am I jealous of Mila Kunis? Heck yes, because she&#39;s gorgeous. Megan Fox? Not so much.

Just my opinion is all. If you think she&#39;s the hottest thing to walk the earth, good for you.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll check out Megan Fox mindlessly for any amount of money.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaYou guys are crazy this look so awesome! I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a mega dose of pure fucking FAIL ..

$11 to mindlessly check out Megan Fox for 90 minutes?  No thanks ...
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathats my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathats my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitayou dont know she is a angel
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathats my wife
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t hate Megan. I just don&#39;t get  the attraction that males have for her. See seems fake to me.

It&#39;s not that I&#39;m jealous or anything. I mean, if you were to say that you think Mila Kunis is hot, I wouldn&#39;t object. 

Just I have to disagree about Megan.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitapause at 1:00 and look at her thumbs
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitano no no you dont know ok you cant know ok so dont talk like that you just hate Megan cuz shes a angel but in this movie shes a demon but still a angel ok
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaDude, I am a girl. I hate Twilight and I think this movie is going to stink just as bad.

Just saying.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to guess your wife is supposedly Megan Fox.

Which, I hate to point out, kind of proves my point that the majority of people will only like the movie because she&#39;s in in.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitayeah and plz dont make fun of her
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitayea you know it
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaYour wife?
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaits horro and it got my wife in it
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaJust curious, what do you like about it?

C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafuck you its the best
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be the best movie every
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaLooks lame. And will only be watched because of Megan Fox.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafuck you it going to be the best
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitafirst off i heard from personal interviews, and its my thought which i am entitled too, so thanks. and you can call me stereotypist, but its not true. and yes she is attractive, which is probably the only way she got to where she is today, because america likes that, i like people who can act.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaha! megan fox looks hilarious in this. she cant act, and shes a bitch i saw on some interviews that she thinks she gonna be the next big thing.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaMegan Fox can&#39;t act...  She makes Transformers look bad.  All she got going for her is her good looks.
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitashe bad mouthed micheal bay because she said how micheal bay&#39;s movies r all about effects which is true
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitamichael bays not directin the third one
C8azftM5puIdelimeterByIshitaAgreed. But what else have we come to expect from Fox these days?

uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaDid I just hear Oscar #2??
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaso.....silver linings playbook part 2 or something?<br><br>come on, lawrence is awesome, but this trailer is further shedding light on the fact that she isn&#39;t the most versatile actor out there
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaPeople can Tell this movie gonna receive an Oscar without watchin it)!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaBradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence love working together....
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaIS THIS A MOVIE? I HAVE TO PAY TO SEE THIS? IS THIS PLANET EARTH?
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitagood
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaBut what is this movie actually about?
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaSo hyped that David O. Russell is going to direct a movie in my town
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaOf course this movie has to be premiered one week after The Force Awakens
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaOSCAR BAIT.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitagood
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI feel like The Big Short is going to be way better, but somehow she is still going to win the oscar.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good movie, except for the fact this is like what the 3rd movie with both Jennifer Lawrence and Bradly Cooper. Like can you guys do at least like a few movies by yourselves before doing another movie together. It really breaks immersion when I see you guys together in movies repeatedly. Especially if they are both a couple in this movie again.

uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI hope De Niro gets nominated and wins
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitameh. lost interest in jlaw when all she seems to be doing is david o russell movies &amp; franchises.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaHmm I wonder if Godmother is gonna come out next year
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaThat last line was sooo flat!! No one can take those two anymore. Those two actors are really annoying and overrated.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so tired of these two fucks... seriously that&#39;s enough. plus they maybe are the most overrated actors in history.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this all my favorite.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitano way she&#39;s old enough to have kids that age.<br>come on.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitawe already know she&#39;s getting an Oscar for this, I mean this trailer alone deserves an Oscar😩😍🙌
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitathis will be trampled by Star Wars 7&#39;s sales
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaHate
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitathis is not going to make a lot of money because Star Wars 7 is coming out the same day.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a bore fest.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaLove Lawrence and De Niro, I was hoping they would play father and daughter since SLP.  Really looking forward to this.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitathat last line will...

uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaTrailer Songs?
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI want to see it. JLaw looks fierce like nothing she has done before.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitalooks great but kinda feel like I&#39;ve seen the whole movie now from this trailer&#39;s length and revealing nature.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaOscar #2 for Jennifer Lawrence 💗
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaIs it possible to like this more than once?!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaIs that one chick the one from What Would You Do? I feel like she&#39;s everywhere
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaBossss lady!!!! I will be first in line!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaLook, we all know that J Law will be great in this. I&#39;m just over the moon that De Niro is back acting in a proper, intelligent breed of film like he used to before all the crappy romantic comedies and so on. It&#39;s been a while.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI sure hope Jennifer got her 20 million plus for this movie so she wont complain to the public about how she isn&#39;t getting paid enough compared to her co-stars. I hope this movie flops.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so proud of you Edgar Ramirez :&#39;) Venezuela!! :)
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaGood lord when she says &quot;Listen to me. Never speak on my behalf. About my business ever again&quot;, I went rigid with fear! <br>She<br>is <br>EPIC!!!!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaGive Jen another Oscar already!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaYou go Jen!!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitatem um filme que tem todos esse atores. n sei qual é mais tem
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaIf she doesn&#39;t win at the Oscars I swear my rifle is right next to me...
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaThe world doesn&#39;t owe you a thing. <br><br>Wow, I think she just gets better at acting. I mean when I saw Winter&#39;s Bone, that was already a wonderful job, Silver... was great, especially for her young age, Hustle was fun, but also complex, which is a tough thing to create, and it seems like this is gonna be even better. It&#39;s kinda funny that she&#39;s already an Oscar winner and she&#39;s only at the beginning of her already-awesome career.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaThe Bee Gees, y&#39;all !
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence ♥
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaWow, Jennifer, Bradley and De Niro together again,  i loved Silver Linings Playbook. Looking forward already....
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaWhy would anyone put Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper together in a movie? She will start complaining about money again.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so obvious that this movie will win Best Picture at the Oscars. Will it be deserving? Maybe or maybe not. But considering that David O Russell who has never won an Oscar is both the director AND a producer on this film, it&#39;s glaring and obvious that this movie will be the winner.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI love Jennifer but she&#39;s overrated.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a> Does JLaw&#39;s face really need that much buttering?
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaMaybe just maybe this will be better than American Hustle.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d much rather see this than Overhyped-Wars.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> called ??
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaMight as well just give her the Oscar.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaOh look another Hollywood bullshit we all gotta watch 
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaOSCAR NOMINATION AND WIN PLS!!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaman this looks GOOD
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so ready for this movie my Jen is awesome 😊😍😍👏👏
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so ready for this movie my Jen is awesome 😊😍😍👏👏
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence&#39;s acting always feels like a little girl trying to act like an adult. Maybe it&#39;s because she still looks very young.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaWOW. Not that I needed a promising trailer to watch anything headlined by J. Law.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaAre we supposed to believe she&#39;s 40 now?<br>Jennifer speaking about the inequality that affects women in the industry, and yet here she is taking a role that should have been for a 40 year old actress.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like someone wants the oscar again. :D
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI like her a lot but i don&#39;t think that she will win another Oscar. She&#39;s too young and the race has actress who never won one. It could start some backlash against her. A nomination she already has for sure. She looks very good here. I&#39;ll definitely see it.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita<b>*</b> Interesting?<br><a href="https://youtu.be/uR-2TiQVY-k">https://youtu.be/uR-2TiQVY-k</a>
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaGO GET THAT OSCAR MY DEAR ICON
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitasong???? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a>
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita&quot;Listen to me, never speak on my behalf, about my business, again&quot;<br><br>How would you rate her delivery? It&#39;s exceptional IMO. Not cheesy or forced at all, like many other actors would do.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaDislike<br>did not like her act at all
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaAmo a Jennifer Lawrence ❤️ Este trailer es excelente, el elenco perfecto !<br>La quiero ver YA!! ❤️
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI heard an OSCAR? Oh yeah.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaAnd the race for Best Actress is over. Who is Brie Larson?
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaInvestors need to stop giving David O Russell money.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR-2TiQVY-k&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a> Goose bumps !
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence&#39;s major competitor for the Oscars would probably be Brie Larson (Room). She also did an amazing job there. Its going to be a tough year for the Academy to vote. =)
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaA lot of movies coming out this Christmas that looks promising. This, Hateful 8, The Revenant, Hail Caesar, and the new Star Wars!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaGet that oscar Jen  !!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaJenn is AMAZINGGGG😍😍
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitai can smell oscars
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting and good movie.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita25 December? most wrong time ever ... STAR WARS IS ON 18 DECEMBEEER AND NO ONE WILL SEE THIS
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaThis is Winter`s Bone caliberJennifer Lawrence, she`s bringing it here.She WILL be nominated for this and she may well win.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaJlaw slay
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitameh
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI love Jennifer Lawrence. I love David O. Russell&#39;s movie.<br>So, I&#39;ll definitely LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!

uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitalooove Jennifer 😍😍
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! Give her her Oscar already!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaDavid O. Russel film starring Lawrence &amp; Cooper? If it weren&#39;t for American Hustle I might be excited.
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaSecond!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited!!
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshita2nd
uR-2TiQVY-kdelimeterByIshitafirst!!!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitanot too bad
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaAnother CGI movie ... 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaYou mean... coitus?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitathe whole world is about Medieval, game of thrones and this shit right now.....boring shit, its like a Virus coming over Hollywood coz the money is good
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaJilianne Moore is soooo sexy!!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitajack and the beanstalk 2 its gonna suck.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaan upgraded version of malevolent?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaClearly this is not the Wardstone Chronicles, which is a shame, but given the calibre of acting involved from the likes of Bridges, Barnes and Moore, I&#39;ll watch it for those names if nothing else. 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaneeds moar CGI<br>kappa
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitawhy isn&#39;t Iron Maiden being played for this preview
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSome of the creature design looks awful. What a waste of CGI.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaRuined. All ruined.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI think it will do well in theaters. It looks fun!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaGlad to know they didn&#39;t call this off. I&#39;ve been wanting to see this for a long time. 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason, it does not look interesting. Reminds me of Clash of Titans and Season of the Witch. 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaTo Smith Smithson...probably about as bad as it looks with green screen and cgi..
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason, Bridges hasnt taken on a good role since his reprisal of John Waynes role from an old flick Wayne did. After that, hes been in garbage like the remake of Tron and now this crap
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThe seventh son should be like 13 years old and the actor look way older
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThose Cg creations looked perfect.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitai luv fantasy, i luv Jeff Bridges  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nohomo">#nohomo</a>  but i&#39;m willing to bet someone&#39;s monthly salary this will be sheeeeeet
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaooo...sexy.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI just wish they would follow the books for movies like this I would have loved to see some of my favourite book characters put on the big screen correctly for once but yet again it&#39;s take the names rewrite the story to fit the screen which by now they should have realised doesn&#39;t work 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitalooks cool
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSeventh Son and Jupiter Ascending are both being released on the same day!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitathey fucked the book deep in the ass. crap movie again. 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaHabrá que ir a verlaa!!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaGreat actors, CGI looks plastic unfortunately.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXiNkOjM7oM&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> Did anybody get a Witcher 2 vibe here?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaElder Scrolls: The Movie
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is awesome, but it has obviously NOTHING even closely alike to the books --&#39;
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaJust gonna be another shitty February movie.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThe spooks apprentice was one of my favourite books growing up and it deserves a lot of credit for the basis of this films plot
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI really hope I&#39;m wrong about this but:<br><br>This movie&#39;s production has been plagued with bad luck, drop out workers, bankruptcy, and will delayed roughly 2 years since it&#39;s original release date - not to mention it&#39;s February release date (a dumping month for studios). There&#39;s enough to make a great trailer but I doubt it will score highly with the critics and also likely bomb at the box office.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitathe books are cool too
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this. I hate they pushed the release date. 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll see it. I&#39;m a sucker for bad fantasy schlock.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhen the hell is this movie coming out??? They released a trailer like in 2013
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitathe seventh son of the seventh son<br>I&#39;ve seen that before in &quot;the seeker: the dark is rising&quot;
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaYou know nothing jon snow
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaNot a good adaptation from the books. Maybe a good movie...
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not like the book at all, but that doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t b a good movie. And for people who don&#39;t know, it&#39;s based off a uk book series, known as spooks apprentice. I&#39;ve read every single one and they are great. It can easily rival with Harry potter
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t feel anything watching this trailer, I sense a flop from a what could have been done better movie.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI sorta like the look of this kinda reminds me of old school fantasy movies back in the 90s :3 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThe main caracter looks like a scared nerd 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitanete nezaman düşer onu haber edin hele siz :D
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaYou can&#39;t kill Jon Snow, he still has to defend the wall
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaFor a second i though this was attack on titan
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThis kinda looks cool but the cgi looks really out of place...why dont they do these fully CGI instead? like those kids movies.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaYes, there are some big changes, but books and movies are two separate mediums. What worked in the book won&#39;t necessarily work in the movie (and vice-versa). With that being said, this looks very good<br>and I can&#39;t wait to see it.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhats with the really bad blur filters?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWill watch it just for the spiked-chain wielding kobold
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaLoving fantaasy movies, Jeff Bridges, Ben Barnes and Julianne Moore, I think I will have to see this movie :)
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThe only things that grabbed my attention in this trailer:<br>1) Jeff Bridges, just because it&#39;s Jeff Bridges. <br>2) The American accents. They&#39;re incredibly ill-fitting.<br>3) And last but not least, Jon Snow, who still clearly knows nothin&#39;.  
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaBastard Snow?! XD
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhy are people whining?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThis is based off of the last apprentice book series
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaGeralt, is that you?!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m guessing the only reason jeff bridges signed on for this was because of julianne moore - looks like its gonna be a flop for the Dude this time 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaNice voice-over by Bane.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSome might question the casting in this. I don&#39;t feel like Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore are the right people for the role... just doesn&#39;t feel right
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThere is something about movies these days, the way the story flows like your supposed to care about the characters, the characters are going on a journey and you don&#39;t feel invited. This feels like clash of the titans, they just try to hard with over the top acting that feels like they are showing off and just don&#39;t feel impressed.<br>Game of thrones does it better, feels natural.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaomg so it will be realeased?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhy does Jeff Bidges sound like Bane 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSo is Kit Harington getting typecast already?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing a trailer for this way back when and I thought it would be on DVD by now, but it was supposed to be released in February, but it got pushed back to January of 2015 due to studios changing hands over it again and again, so now its like &quot;maybe&quot; it will come out in the summer of 2015.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaanother American film ... still waiting for the multi-polar world we are supposed to live, is about time that other world powers would be more prominent ...
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty lame
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like tgey have ruined the story from the books
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitatotally ripped off withcher 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaLoved the books &#39;the ward stone chronicles&#39; but this looks nothing like it and looks crap 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThats some badass stuff right there
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaIn Bodrov we trust.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t it canceled? oO
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaUniversal and Legendary = MUST WATCH! :)
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaJulianne Moore is SOOOO sexy -3-
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell did Legendary approve this movie for 2015 while working on WarCraft? That&#39;s literally a public relation disaster.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshita-Come and see the Seventh son, claim your destiny.<br>-And what, Legendary Pictures, must we give in return?<br>-Everything.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshita&quot;You are the seventh son of the seventh son&#39;&#39;...loll...anywayss..looks great
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be AMAZING
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaOf a seventh son, maiden fans will understand 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaAt first i belived this was the movie with septimus hiep. beacuse he is the 7th son of a seventh son.<br>still looks worth to watch :D
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSo Prince Caspian left the world of Narnia to be trained by the Dude to fight evil and stuff in not so glorious CGI? Well I like what Legendary produces so I&#39;ll give this a shot.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitasolomon! where is tze diamond?
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI was the sixth son, no one cared about me :(
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaOh god, another CGI crap!
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaKinda hoped it would be Septimus Heap.....
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaJeff Bridges doesn&#39;t fit this role...
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing the first trailer for this last year &amp; it&#39;s funny because I thought about this movie the other day &amp; wondering if it was still coming out or if it was scrapped.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaSo the hobbit meets stardust meets supernatural... I&#39;m excited
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaIt may well be <b>inspired</b> by the books, but it looks like that&#39;s where the similarities end...
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThat Filter doe
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitalooking good
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell... I love the Spook series and this doesn&#39;t even look any where close to it :( oh well i guess ill have to watch it to find out what it&#39;s like. plus in the book i&#39;m pretty sure the main character is like 15 to 16 :l 
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaI can see few WoW heroes here :O
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitathis has nothing to do with the books they totally crapped on this and its going to be a huge flop. what a shame Ive been waiting 6 years for this movie.
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitacoo
TXiNkOjM7oMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks nothing like the books, but I think it will still be good
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaAmazing lineup of actors and comedians in this movie
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing.
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaThis just may be the best movie of 2013!
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaWhy couldn&#39;t Kal Penn and John Cho cameo in this film???
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaI see this as: 

Final Destination + South Park + any Judd Apatow film = This Is the End.
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaSERIOUSLY! Where&#39;s Andy Samberg?
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaBy none other than Kevin Hart! HA!
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaYou have no fuckin&#39; idea.

kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitadoes that mean the train that rails downtown would not run if that happened right 
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaI agree with you 100% I wonder how many people always wanted a movie like this in any genre? Hmmmm. Now im definitely going to see this movie cause of how you described this movie the way it is and how funny it is. 
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaSo many comedic actors in one movie, hilariously awesome, Emma Watson comes out of nowhere stealing stuff from muggles, and maybe before she gets back with Ron, she&#39;ll falcon punch Malfoy in the face and take refuge at the harry potter theme park in Orlando with Ron Weasley. When I saw emma in the trailer, I was like WTF is she doing in this movie? HAHAHAHA and how did she get involved in this movie? 
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaThere about to make sooo much money off this
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshita*passes out* 
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s like the expendables of comedy stars

kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaDid you think Hitman Absolution was a good game? That game sucked massive donkey balls. We can&#39;t all like the right things, it&#39;s just a shame you like all the wrong things.
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaDamn, this looks really fucking funny... sweeeettttt
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaFucking amazing!!!
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaComplete &amp; utter piece of forced shit movie. Disgusting. 
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaSo this is how it ends, not too shabby

kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitajay baruchel doesn&#39;t belong there anymore, but since he was in the short they had to keep him there
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaThis will be awesome
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshita0:56 And that&#39;s still not the worst thing to happen to Rihanna...
kliQSsD_npodelimeterByIshitaJust found the second song!! The song with the lyrics &quot;Whatchu want son, this is my game&quot; etc. The song is called &quot;Watchu Want&quot; by Belief. It hasn&#39;t been released yet there&#39;s only a 30 second preview on YouTube! Like this so people see and stop asking!

IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitai cant bring myself to watch the Divergent movie probably wont see this either. the third book left a bad taste in my mouth that i can&#39;t get over. so much character development gone down the drain in one instant. shoulda been Caleb, damn traitor.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWhy the fuk did shy cut her hair
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaYAAAAAAAAAS
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitatanto les costaba seguir fieles a los libros? cagada de pelicula para lo fans
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOooo weeee this movie is going to be crazy I can&#39;t wait to see this on my bday month!!! :D 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaNothing like the book. Ugh 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaAnd Tris is terrified of guns after what she did to will in the books..?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitathat box isn&#39;t in the book, is it? I don&#39;t remember it, just Tris and Tobias fighting a lot and calebs betrayal and peter being &#39;i can&#39;t own anyone anything&#39; 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThree words: Hunger Games ripoff.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaDoes tris really has short hair in the book?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still really sceptical about this movie, divergent was bad enough, but seriously what&#39;s up with those wires that look like tentacles? The first trailer looked like Spider-Man with Tris jumping all over the place. In saying this the movie probably won&#39;t be too bad. Once they don&#39;t forget major characters or plot lines like they did in the divergent movie. I adore these books so please don&#39;t ruin them for me Summit Screening
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaDid not expect to see that but it was so cool
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWait didn&#39;t Mocking jay come out already??
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThat was the best trailer I&#39;ve ever seen!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s sooooo good 💗😭
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaTobias&#39;s mother is too young !!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitafirst I liked a bit, but this time it looks crap !
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaDid i just see the whole movie?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaim not even gonna lie insurgent looking RIGHTTT
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOMFG CANT WAIT
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaUghh I wish Kate Winslet still had red hair like in Titanic :(
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaMocking pt 2 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitait does look good.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitawait wheres katniss?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaAlthough it doesn´t look like the book I think this is going to be a really good movie. And a sex scene... we didn&#39;t have that in the book... 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThanks! Now I dont have to go watch to the movies, since I now know the whole plot!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOMG. This is amazing!<br>I think it&#39;s great they doing some changes in the movie :) 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t it so perfect???
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaanother shitty movie.. my god the first movie was so damn shit.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll probably go to the theater to just see a PG-13 sex scene cuz this looks boring as hell
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaJai Courtney all over the place...
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI wonder how much it will gross?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOmg Look good :)
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaAnyone else notice that back piercing Tris has? 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitanice trailer!!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaYes because showing sex scene in the trailer will make people watch the movie.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks good 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer. Hope the movie is way better.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaGotta read the book first. 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThis is starting to look like The Hunger Games and Twilight.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaXD
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll wait for the DVD. Divergent was nothing like the trailer and only the last 15-20 minutes were good. I bet this will be the same so no money from me.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaSorry but I JUST don&#39;t get the whole idea/point of this world and everything that happens in it. I&#39;ve tried to read the books and understand the films, but... I JUST DON&#39;T GET IT
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaLove it!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThis is nothing like the book
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaShailene&#39;s hair is on point!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWas the box thingy in the book? It&#39;s been well over a year since I last read it but I feel like I&#39;d remember something like this 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m usually fairly tolerant of movie &quot;adaptations&quot; to books. I realize its impossible to translate a book perfectly to the big screen but this is freaking ridiculous! I at least want it to follow the same basic plot as the book and tell a similar story. I don&#39;t even recognize this!!! <br><br>NO JUST NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWAT?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOMG! There are some changes, but I think it will be better than the books ;)
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaSo..not only is she a special snowflake in the general population because she is divergent...but she&#39;s a special snowflake even amongst the divergents? I call bullshit. Still gonna pirate it though.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so much better then I thought it was going to be Looks so much better then 1st one and I think this is going to be the &quot;catching fire&quot; for the series Looking forward to it 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWoooooooo that movie was good only 3 minutes long 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWhat??? I don&#39;t remember this being the plot of insurgent. And I don&#39;t like the approach they decided to take.  
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaBOOOOOOOO!!! the first one was bullshit!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThat haircut ....
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaAWESOME
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOMG
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaDivergent, Insurgent, Handargent, Altargent, Bilargent, Kapergent, Nutirgent, Fatorgent and it will keep coming...
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitawhy they all look like hungry dirty models with 0 face expressions teen pop american generation movies
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT 😱
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaGreat. Another shitty book movie... Woopty-Doo
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaYawn...pass.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaLol no
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitawhew now i don&#39;t have to watch the movie :)
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWow, this actually has me excited for the movie. Good job.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI love this!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaDid we just watch the whole movie?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThis looks shitty lol I don&#39;t really recognize anything that was in the book?! Her mom wasn&#39;t in insurgent and her and four don&#39;t have sex and Peter is the one who saved her Because he owed her?? But here she looks like she saves herself, and we didn&#39;t even see any of four?? 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOMG i love divergent this looks fantastic i cant wait to see the second part<br>I love the books and the movies will be so great!!!!!!! Better than thg for me :)
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait omg
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaNow this shit became completely unrealistic 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaToo much dun dun dun dun dun
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaWhy does Woodley always insist on having short hair. She would be incredibly attractive if she didn&#39;t look like a dude.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaThe title of the music is : See what I&#39;ve become, from Zack Hemsey ;) 
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaYASSSSSSSS. Tris and Four forever! ❤ I literally cannot wait to see this. More action, more romance, and more insane lucid dreams? WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR?
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitathat was more revealing than an 80s trailer
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaSong: Zack Hemsey-See what i&#39;ve become.
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitashut up and take my money !!!!
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitawow a movie based off a book geared towards teen girls about a teen girl who is special for who she is. What an original idea
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaAnyone else getting strong Matrix vibes from this one? (and I&#39;m not just talking about when the girl gets plugged in like Neo at the end of Revolutions)
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitaOmg
IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitashowed is the whole film and itmis very similiar to the maze runner books<br>ps. maze runner came out way before

IR-l_TSjlEodelimeterByIshitafirst
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaNow here is a guy I want my children to look up to
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get me wrong Stephen Hawking is a very smart guy but he is just flat out rude. He basically calls anyone who believes in any religion stupid and that it&#39;s fairy tales. It&#39;s one thing to believe in something other than religion but to insult others for what they believe in its not something I can agree with. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaEMOTIONALLY PROMISING WITH MATCHING LOOKS, AND WHAT SEEMS LIKE BRILLIANT ACTING BY THE LEAD, FROM WHATEVER GLIMPSE WE HAVE HERE! STEPHEN HAWKING HAS ALWAYS EVOKED GOOSE BUMPS IN ME, FOR WHATEVER ACHIEVEMENTS HE HAS DESPITE WHATEVER SEVERE DISABILITIES HE HAS HAD. PERHAPS NOTHING SHORT OF THE TITLE OF &quot;MOST DESERVING GENIUS OF ALL TIMES&quot; WILL DO JUSTICE TO THIS MAN. I AM REALLY HOPING THAT THE MOVIE DOES JUSTICE TO THE STORY (TAKING KEY POINTS OF HIS SCIENTIFIC WORK AS WELL TO THE VIEWERS ALONGSIDE THE EMOTIONAL TRACK, WHICH MOVIES BASED ON TRUE STORIES HAVE OFTEN FAILED TO DO IN THE PAST)!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaawesome... (y) ....,, i respect this guy...
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaJust beautiful 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaIm probably going to cry in this movie
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaOMG IT&#39;S CHARLIEISSOCOOLLIKE AKA CHARLIE MCDONNEL 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be absolutely incredible, I can feel it. CANNOT wait.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSomebody jsut told me life was about learnin an shit, hahahaha.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaIt took to 2015 to make a Stephen Hawking movie? We should of made one decades ago.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaWow that looks really good. And to think I was going to compare it with Hawking, another film about his life in which Benedict Cumberbatch plays him... which was a really good film. This looks like it will be really inspiring too. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaOn my channel there&#39;s a girl that runs like a wolf.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaHe cheated on her...
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSeriously, what&#39;s the bloody music used in this trailer? I have to have!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaIt is from her point of view...basically dont mention much of his achievements and what he means to us, instead lets show this cute love story that isnt really that cute. I wanted to see more of him.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaOmg my face is making so much water!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaGosh... its so beautiful~
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of A Beautiful Mind.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitawhy did this bring tears to my eyes??? cause ever since I saw eddie redmayne win the tony award I&#39;ve thought he was the sexiest male celebrity in the world...so to see him play this part will really overwhelm me, cannot wait!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI wonder want Stephen Hawking thinks of this 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI can tell you right now, I&#39;m seeing this movie.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see it. It looks Amazing 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaWhats wrong with you 78 folks who disliked this?!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t they divorce?  It also seems to water down his life...
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so incredibly hard for Hollywood to ACTUALLY make biopics about the discoveries, hardships, and struggles these scientists, engineers, doctors and businessmen faced when dealing with some sort of underlying scientific foundation. These scripts do not need to be spoon-fed or dumbed down for audiences, It needs to stick with a centralized and focused point about the person in question. This for example could&#39;ve talked greatly about how Hawking came about with his theories regarding black holes and delve into such topics as Hawking Radiation, Black Hole Entropy, The Singularity or even the Information Loss Paradox which by the could tie nicely in with Hawking&#39;s feud with another famous physicist Leonard Susskind. But no, they&#39;ve decided to make another &quot;Hollywood&quot; story that focuses more on Hawking&#39;s relationship with his wife Jane and how they both cope with his ALS probably for the sake of another emotional baggage love story. <br><br>Primer is a great example of what I&#39;m talking  about. AND Shane Carruth, director and actor in the movie, actually has a background in software engineering and mathematics, so the way he presents his story is reflected through his script&#39;s technical dialogue which added a layer of depth to his story, which I personally loved.<br><br>If this is how keeps going with Jobs and now this, I&#39;m just keen on the day they decide to make a biopic about Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Tesla, Bohr, Planck, Fleming, or even the great David Hilbert and have it NOT have to do ANYTHING with their personal struggle to find exactly what they wanted from their lifetime and what they wanted to achieve, and instead focus some other innocuous aspect about their life which deters so much away from what they actually accomplished that it almost gives the audience an entirely wrong perspective of the person they truly are and/or what the difficulties and struggles they went through to become some of the most well respected, most influential people in human history.<br><br>Fuck you Hollywood. I&#39;m done. <br><br>Note: Despite all that I have said, this does look like a fairly well crafted movie, and I will probably go see it with my friends when it comes out. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaStephen Hawking had a girlfriend ???? <br><br>
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaAt laaaaaast!!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitawow can&#39;t wait
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaWhere there is a black hole at the begging there is no hope you dumba$$! Where there is life (in sciences eyes) there is a murderous prey, being, disease, evolutionary natural selection, phenomenon or bad luck that is looking to kill you. I mean why besides his astrology knowledge does anyone take this guy serious. He is intelligent but any a$$hole can be smart. That&#39;s why people call them smarta$$es.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the music that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Salz7uGp72c&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a>?
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaremake of epic &#39;Hawking&#39; movie
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaseeing it
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaFelicity jones ?

Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSo beautiful
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshita@Luigi Bianco Can you please shut up
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer made me want to rewatch &quot;Hawking&quot; with Benedict Cumberbatch
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI was tearing up while watching this
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaMy granddad had MND. I was only 9 at the time, but it woke me up to reality. There is no such thing as hell. We live in it. But it is what you make of this world that we live in that really counts. No one truly lives their lives until they know it is going to end. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaBoom shocka locka, boom shocka locka!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone deny that inundating every White country on earth (and ONLY White countries) with tens of millions of non-Whites and forcing their assimilation into the White community is an act of genocide?<br>Black countries will remain Black, and Asian countries will remain Asian,<br>White countries are the ONLY countries to be affected by this.<br>But, instead of genocide, the word used by anti-Whites to describe this program is &quot;diversity.&quot;<br>Diversity means chasing down White flight.<br>Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaWow. Looks amazing
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaRESPECT!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI have a personal theory that the thing most responsible for Dr. Hawking being alive today,more than anything else in his post diagnosis world, save for the exception of his wife, is that little computer. Not in any measurable way. It doesn&#39;t regulate any body part I&#39;m aware of, except one. His mind! By giving him the ability to allow his ideas to escape.<br><br>Ask any creator or artist and they will tell you that the most distressing part of creating, is not being able to express the ideas that take hold of your mind and demand to be released into the world. The all consuming compulsion to have life charged into your thoughts by making them tangible in some way. Trust me Theoretical Physics and Mathematics take just as much creativity and abstract thinking as any song or painting. Look at the concept Einstein&#39;s theory of Special Relativity (E=MC²) presents, with such beauty and elegance, then tell me honestly you don&#39;t see art in it.<br><br>If Dr. Hawking was to be, not only bed ridden, immobilized, but silenced by his disease as well, I would imagine his life would have ended much earlier. Instead of the 100 years from now, where he will pass away as the result of being shot by the jealous husband of a 22 year old centerfold model. Like Dr. Hawking can help how sexy women find his big... brain!<br><br>Seriously though. I don&#39;t mean just his ability to describe a problem to those who assist him with his health. That may obviously be the difference in life and death, but that of his personal worth, gained from the mono-tone American accent of his computer.<br><br>I imagine this man is so full of thought and reasoning that his mind is even defying death itself. It is like his physical life is more horrifying than an H.R.Giger painting but still, he treks on. Not only because of his love for his wonderful and saintly wife but because he has purpose and with purpose comes drive. With drive you gain resolve and with resolve, life. He is here not just for himself and his loved ones but for us. Believing that this world is the only chance you get at existence. That with that belief, the closest you get to immortality is being remembered by the world for you deeds. I think his memory will always be that of a teacher. Just think of all the profound ways in which he teaches us. Not just in his field of study but in his life. All while never saying a word with his own breath. I admire, respect, and adore Hawking on each and every level we usually judge one another.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI wanna watch this. It&#39;d be nice to see a movie about the story of one of the brightest person on earth. If only i were alive in his time, i would&#39;ve asked him alot of questions that no ordinary man can answer. It&#39;d be nice to have a long, deep and educational conversation with him. I will definitely learn alot from him. :)
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaA man that can&#39;t walk or speak has done more for this world than any president or politician ever could. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful trailer. I love that she stayed by his side. I always hear and see stories of great women staying by their lovers side through tough times but I never hear about men doing the same for some reason. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI love eddie redmayne!!!!:)
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer, great story!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaA movie that cant be missed !

Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaHawking&#39;s wife was not an arts student... Right?!

Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaOMG Can&#39;t wait!!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSave yourself the time and trouble and watch Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Hawking in &quot;Hawking&quot;. I have no idea why they would make this when it&#39;s been done so well already
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSuper. Excited. <br><br><br>That is all.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler: Hawking left his wife and kids for his nurse.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23love">#love</a>   
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaThis Looks Absolutely Brilliant, Can&#39;t Wait. I Love Stephen Hawking ;&#39;) 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaReduce the story of one of the greatest minds of our time down to cute boy meets cute girl. How predictable.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaoscar worthy!!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tears">#tears</a>

Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI am so STOKED. Dr. Hawking is one of my great role models. 
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaI was there when he was filming!!
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks sad and cute<br><br>Love really shows his light when all seems dark
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaThis look disappointing.  Alan Turing&#39;s The Imitation Game seems to be the better one of these two.
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaProfessor Lupin and Viserys Targaryen/creepy guy from Doctor Who!! ^.^
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSo, how is this suppose to be different from the Cumberbatch film made in 2004?
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitawhy they have to put romance in everywhere?
Salz7uGp72cdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: they get divorced

8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitazombie movies need a big budget to be awesome.

i wish people would stop combining zombies and carnivals.
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaLol i thought zombies are slow, since where do they get proteins from. They suppose super skinny.
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitathe nerd kid is the dude from Cursed =/ but idk looks stupid T_T
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s as if you combined Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising. 

Lol, I don&#39;t know about any of you guys, but Woody Harrelson&#39;s character reminds me of Francis in Left 4 Dead. XDDD
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitatoo true dude same here
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaIf they made Left 4 dead into an actual movie, that would be fucking badass (though that story line seems to be rather overused)

Shaun of the Dead was a brilliant zombie movie, this one only looks good thanks to Harrelson.
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaWOW! This looks like an absolute piece of crap. It looks like it took only like 3 days to make. Is this supposed to be a knock off of &quot;Shaun Of The Dead&quot;. That was a good movie. But this looks like a waste of money.
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaAwesome!
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaGotta see it.
8m9EVP8X7N8delimeterByIshitaReminds me a little of Left4Dead

GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis director will do spiderman homecoming now
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks fucked. Anything that you can&#39;t get rid of,off of you,or starts to become you gets me freaked.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitawtf lol
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE FUCK THIS MOVIE IS TWO YEARS OLD #@&amp;@£#¥@₩;@^$&amp;!₩@₩€
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis movie is on YouTube you don&#39;t have to go to the theaters lol
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaFinally! A horror movie that&#39;s not a terrible ghost story with tons of CGI. THANK YOU!
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t Horror just leave clowns alone?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitawould you guys recommend me to watch this movie
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis movie is horrible, the clown thing eats children and spits out their bones and the guy tries to kill himself and won&#39;t die, he ends up dying in the end when its not even him anymore and they chop off its head to kill it, the suit still gets passed on to someone else in the end, I don&#39;t know why they won&#39;t just burn the thing and end it ?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitayo this movie came out before 2016 i saw it in 2014 man
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaim not scared of clowns anymore i think they are gay
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitawatching this is getting me hyped for the Remake of IT
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaJohn Wayne Gacy on steroids!
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this. It was a proper horror movie in my opinion. Very creepy, and quite scary, I didn&#39;t feel as exasperated with the characters like I normally do (a little, but well within my threshold). I would recommend this :)
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI HATE CLOWNS!!!!!
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis seems... Swell
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching a movie like this on Netflix except the guy was bitten by a clown then turned into one
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaAfter I saw the first frame of this trailer I said fuck this, I&#39;m out.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t people just comment on whether it&#39;s a good movie and worth watching, than just saying they saw it 2 years ago. Who cares. Do you want a prize? Cookie? Pat on the back? Post something valuable like an actual review of the movie. Thnx.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI think I should watch this to overcome my fear of clowns.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaDerp
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWonder how many clown phobics were tricked to watch this by their friends?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was in 2014
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaNice twist on the fly
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaNote To Self Never Wear An Evil Clown Costume For 24 Hours. This Man Learn It The Hard Way.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI fuckin luv this movie
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaShould have been Jim Carrey.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaScary killer clowns. Still?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitais this supposed to be funny?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWhy so serious?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitahow is this so funny, I&#39;m terrified of clowns
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaLooks Like H20 Delirious
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis is why I hate clowns
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis guy is making the new Spider-Man movie ? 😭
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI already have this on dvd.. I&#39;ve had it for about 8 months now.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis movie is from 2 years ago or 1
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitais this the movie eli roth made?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else think of the episode &quot;Afraid of Clowns&quot; from The Haunting Hour when watching this? lol
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI would just kill myself if this happened to me
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaAnd I thought I got over my phobia
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis is a 2014 movie. Not sure why they&#39;re listing it as 2016. It&#39;s a great film and very well written and acted. You can find it on piratebay and all the others.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThe director is helming the new spider-man film.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitalol wtf
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis is essentially what is happening to me, as I get older I realize than I am nothing but a sad clown.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just now coming out? I&#39;ve seen this awhile back good movie btw but wtf?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaOh HELL NO
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know where I can see this???
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitahe is becoming joker :D
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI only clicked on this cuz I thought it said Stromae... but it looks interesting, havent seen a good horror film in a while
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI really want to watch this movie because I love horror movies lol comment if u agree
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitayeah , am going to watch this movie tonight 😀
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaTake Note Wannabe upcoming future directors, this is how you do a proper trailer!!! even though the movie is out, I&#39;m gonna go watch it again on the big screen and support this indie Film so that more indie horror movies get their credit and get made.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaRIP to everyone who has a fear of clowns
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaYe this isn&#39;t a 2016 movie WTF
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is pretty good. One of my favorite clown characters!
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI honestly can&#39;t tell if this is a parody or not.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaConfused, didn&#39;t this come out last year? Because I&#39;ve actually watched this, it was pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is fucking awesome. Not only is it scary, it&#39;s also hilarious! left me in stitches. It&#39;&#39;s a must see. A clown suit that turns the wearer into a demon. what&#39;s not to love? 9/10
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie came out years ago. Why are they still uploading trailers of it?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the reasons why clowns still scares me
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually hella creepy, and I don&#39;t think that about most horror movies...but maybe that&#39;s cause I&#39;m terrified of clowns
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshita&gt;....&gt;
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaSaw this film at least a year or so ago. It&#39;s not bad, nowhere near as good as this trailer makes it look though.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis is goooood😇😇😇
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaNOPE
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis is by the same studio, behide &#39;spy kids&#39;
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else hiding in the comments
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s having a fear of clowns should watch this.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this a new trailer? I saw this AGES ago.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitathis is a joke right?
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaInteresting.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI SAW THIS MOVIE IN 2015
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThat dimension logo takes me back 
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t this an episode of aqua teens? xD
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaReminds me a little bit of The Haunted Mask from Goosebumps. This looks awesome!!

GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie a lot of time ago
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of a Goosebumps book I read way back when I was a kis. About a mask a guy couldn&#39;t take off and slowly turned him into a monster.
GkwHXxcBr1AdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkwHXxcBr1A&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a> when there is not paper in the bathroom

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSo excited.  I live my life waiting for the next Coen Brothers movie.  Intelligent confronting film making.  Love it.

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaOH GOD NOT ANOTHER CLOONEY MOVIE
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaWhen did they start production on this film? Jonah Hill was still fat during this.

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaJonah Hill certainly brings a lot to the table.

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaWas Cesar kidnapped by himself?
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaI feel like 80% of Clooney&#39;s role is him just passed out
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sold.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaCoen brothers великие режиссеры,Hail, Caesar! ждем с нетерпением.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaMusic(2nd half of trailer)?
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaFat Jonah Hill is back!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaPLEASE stop watching the trailer halfway through. Otherwise you see too much of the plot.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitawhat shit movie about movies is this shit
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaYes, this seems very Coen-ish
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaGreat, now I don&#39;t have to see the film to know what happens.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitawhats the song playing at the beginning of the trailer?
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSeeing It!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaCoens and those celebs, hell yes
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaNiceeeeeeeee
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaAt what point will the Coen brothers join forces with Wes Anderson and make a movie together?  Seems like they&#39;re both headed at the same target from slightly different angles.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaThanks, just seen the film. Who says nothing isn&#39;t free.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t be the only one who started to think that this was a Wes Anderson film after the first half of the trailer.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshita1.22 <br>your&#39;e welcome
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitadroch&#39; droch&#39;
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaFirst song?

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see john goodman ?
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitalooks good enough for me
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshita&quot;Eddie?&quot;
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaThanos running the business and being played. What&#39;s wrong with this picture?!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaLooks like another shit film
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaRalph Fiennes did it, calling it now.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaGood lord!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaFebruary? Why? They could have decided to participate in this year&#39;s award season with this.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaAwesome! Love this type of movies. Count me in.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSteve jobs, creed, the big short, the reveant, hateful eight, and then appears this 😍 goodbye to my money :&#39;)
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaInject this movie directly into my veins.

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaCoen brothers? Okay, I&#39;m listening... Clancy Brown? SOLD!

kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitabrace yourself for orGinal comedy omg coen brothers really want big with the cast. love Clooneys and coen brothers combo
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaLooks so good.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSPOILER CITY - Had to stop watching that trailer halfway through - It started spelling out the film plot points in too much detail. They have my money tho&#39; it looks like classic Coen Brothers comedy.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this. A
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitahooooooweeeeee!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSo much YES
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaFrances McDorman, Josh Brolin and Clooney in a coen brothers movie again? Can&#39;t think of one soul who wouldn&#39;t wanna watch this, looks just fucking great, as expected.
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitamaan,  George Clooney got old....
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaSong at the end?
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaПервый из России епта
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaThe 3d
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaReminds me of Barton Fink without the surreal element. Very looking forward to Scarlett in this one!
kMqeoW3XRa0delimeterByIshitaThirst
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOh great, another twilight -_-
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaKILL ME...
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOh god.... 
This shit looks even worse that all the others put together.... 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m not such a big fan of twilight series, or probably i hate it because of the unlovable cast ( Kristen Stewart, and Taylor something ) 
but i think this part gonna be EPIC WAR. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaDumbest finale ever, why don&#39;t the just tell Michael Sheen that the child was born not ibtten. h right, because the thinly laden plot said so
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI came here only to dislike 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitagay final
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThe awkward moment when Robert and Kristen watch their initimate scene after breaking up.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaepic finale? lol wut.....
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaCan any tell where I can find BLADE to kill all of these motherfuckers
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitait´s only one character who can handle the 4 elements
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t they use guns. It could easily kill everybody!!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitafisrt song : Mark Petrie - KaraKul
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaKRISTEN STEWART SHOCKING SEX SCENE I WATCHED AT VIDEOCLIPS2WATCH COM
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t understand.. why are there waterbenders in this movie
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaAgain!!!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaCommon worthless cur thinking...go ahead &amp; keep thinking that kid.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks horrible. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaJesus this looks horrible
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitai realy dont give a shit about your opinion about me. get a life dude...

Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOk so I&#39;m no Twilight fan, but I have seen all the movies, read most of the books and I have an opinion about it (TEAM JACOB!). I sure do love watching Taylor Lautner shirtless and Peter Facinelli is fine as well :) But that being said, the movies especially are so overrated. Compared to Harry Potter, Narnia and The Hunger Games it&#39;s a joke. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that honestly, it&#39;s not even that exciting. Mostly about Edward and Bella &quot;love&quot; who are the 2 most boring characters ever!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThey must&#39;ve just added it in, I&#39;ve also read the ending will be different from the books so.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaLolololol my fav comedy ever
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited to see it, but having read the books, I&#39;m a bit bewildered as to where that &quot;epic&quot; fight scene came from. They never fought in the book.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaWould you like me to get you a toilet roll for all the shit you&#39;re coming out with?
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOf course. I have a natural predisposition to love everything and anything. I guess you weren&#39;t born that way? Two can play this game you know.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaYes because you love everything in the world and there is nothing you hate at all.(sarcasm)
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaAt least this finale has the most combat fighting scene compared to all previous combined.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaLots of hate for a film or book that you haters haven&#39;t even taken time to read (or if you HAVE never really got what it is about). Go on then haters. Life is short for the likes of you.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaYou know what all these movies were horrible. Acting in it is like wow bad
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaYour funny my friend... Beyond full-of-it!! But, funny.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaBetter than Transformers....... Battleship??????
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaWell maybe you need to see the second one also, because your sleeping big-time on this one. That&#39;s all I can say.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI hope you aren&#39;t serious.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaFar better then Transformers... especially that battle scene where they pop that window with the Berrats then light that thing up.

Now I really love how they take the Dreadnaught out for action. Although I think the USS Texas woulda been a better fit for the movie. A Super Dreadnaught...the last one in existence. :)
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOh I see... Well super-hero mash-ups aren&#39;t for everybody. You have to be a real fan of the comics for it to be a big deal too. About Battleship, I found it rather unstimulating. There is some cartoonish CG shots in there. It is definitely good and solid movie, just didn&#39;t impress me. I guess it just wasn&#39;t Transformers. Know what I mean?
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI saw the first movie. One of the worst acted movie I have seen. I would never read the books because they basically represent what the author would imagine when she masturbated. She made Edward out to be her own fantasy. Even Robert Pattinson has said how much he hates the book. Smart move staying with the film I bet he makes a killing of of you twihards...
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaYeah your right... That is a very good observation. I was wondering what those poor souls were smoking. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOnce again, never knock something you haven&#39;t seen. Your mention of being 14 and being a girl shows that you have no actual exposure to the films. Maybe the books turned you off. Still, the films have nothing to do with being 14, and especially not being a girl... Since when was vampirism and werewolves a girl thing?? 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitastep 1: pause video
step 2: insult any fan of this shit 
step 3: dislike
step 4: leave 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen it...nothing &#39;amazing&#39; IMO. Only thing good about it was Iron Man...it makes a complete mockery of Norse religion. No real story line..just a bunch of super heros all together. Boring in other words. Battleship is way underrated and should be WAY more popular then it is.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaAvatar was 2009 (irrelevant re-releases don&#39;t count). 2010 belonged to
Inception, I would say. And if you&#39;ve actually seen Avengers, you know that it is every
bit Avatar&#39;s equal. It is a triumph of filmmaking. Still, nothing will top Avatar for several decades, maybe not even then. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitatbh, I wouldn&#39;t mind Twilight if they had just used a better/hotter actress than Kristin Stewart. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitawait.... there&#39;s fighting???

Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaNo it isn&#39;t. You obviously are a 14 year old girl that doesn&#39;t know what a good movie is. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaJust like low-live pathetic humans like you...you&#39;ll never be a &#39;someone&#39; like you think you will.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaJust like last year belonged to Avatar which holds the world wide record! I find it stupid anyone things &quot;Avengers&quot; topped Avatar is just funny.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaBecause they are so upset it rocks...they secretly love it but have to be in the &#39;popular&#39; belief because they are way to scared to join those who love it. :)
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitacant wait for this movie to come out.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThe Movie Of The Year! &lt;333
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI love the books and def. the movies have left the books down. And Kristen&#39;s indiscration extinguished the little excitement for the last movie. @CooltrailerHD your comment is the best thing about this trailer lol!!!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert! They all died
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like twilight that much to begin with but this movie looks good
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaAt the end, I wish Robert had thrown Kristen like that when he found out she cheated on him.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThe Twilight saga movies are phenomenal. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know that hasn&#39;t seen a single one of them. It&#39;s a great series, and this final chapter looks like it will be the second highlight of the year (everyone knows this year will always belong to Avengers first).
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called &quot;spreading the truth and saving as many innocent humans as possible from this God-awful franchise&quot;
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshita&quot;ive never been afraid of vampires&quot;... wow thats way more epic than &quot;thats my secret im always angry!&quot; 

note* sarcasm! 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaI feel like with the big blockbuster that Twilight is the effects would be a little bit better. My only major issue was when Bella jumped the mountain lion, didn&#39;t look as cool as I was hoping for.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaand this shit will never be epic
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitai came here for the comment&#39;s  *___*
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshita1:53 Hulk Smash ..... Hoo!!! wait never mind.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaWhy would those cool vampires all fight to the death with basically their government for one love child? 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaat the end of the trailer thats robert pattinson getting angry and throwing kristen stewart! HAHAHAHAH a vulturi just happened to be in the way. 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitacuz haters like to watch movie trailes, and when they see this movie they just need to expres how much they hate this movie, i hate it, but that doesnt mean i cant watch the trailer
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaNO YOU DONT SAY YOU FAT FUCKING FUCK!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThats some fantasy ass shit!..am not hating on the movie,i even like the first one...but why do they have to exaggerate every thing, from the fights to the speech...watching this trailer makes me feel awkward...i never thought this movie would have go the way it is going, the first movie i kinda cared for the characters but after that! thats a nother story
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitadafuq i just watch!?
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaBecause Twilight Sucks!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaeverything has led to this yall. don&#39;t ask me what everything is because i have no fucking idea what they&#39;re talking about.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitathe like bar speak for herself
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaThings are going to be awkward on the red carpet.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaBeing a hater is a way of living, it takes time, dedication, and sacrifice by having to watch this trailers or even the movies to the end. 
To every hater out there, you&#39;r not alone ;)
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitahours to control the elements vampires?
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaVolturi style death eaters OMG
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaif it&#39;s a terrible series then why do you go on this trailer, about a movie you don&#39;t like, to comment on it. and twilight being a terrible series is YOUR OPINION. some people enjoy these movies.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitabecause they have no life......
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaJeez haters, shut up. You got your wish, its&#39; over. Now let us Twilight fans enjoy it without your hating.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaEveryone is entitled to an opinion and mine is that this movie series is horrible finally the conclusion! :) 
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitameh..
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURN!
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitabc we wanna see how bad it is

Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshita0:20 I&#39;ve seen better CGI on beast wars.
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitaOh we don&#39;t watch we just come to dislike then we go our merry ways...

Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshitawhy are all the twilight haters the first ones to watch and comment on the video?
Ocz50YJOFTMdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;Epic Finally , that will live forever&#39;&#39; really?????!!!!!!wtf

T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitawhat if the guy goes in a dark place and thinks of his childhood?......will he have to live it all over again??....interesting!!!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaWas this a book of some sorts?? I&#39;d really appreciate if I know the name please anyone.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshita@hineighbor Serisoilsy!?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaThe twist ending is that he&#39;s his own dad.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaIf I could travel in time I would have killed so many people !!!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitafor all movie fans who like to talk about films go to facebook page &quot;movie chat.dvd,bluray and cinema
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI go about my day thinking and saying that the universe isn&#39;t real.  It&#39;s a virtual reality that is so detailed to the smallest bit. 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaguy calls me an asshole so i stab him then go back in time before i kill him ... HEY i found a new way to vent my aggression
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaYes but even if you do create an alternate timeline you would technically have to be in contact with your future or past self. Your past self would have to be in the same location but your current self would have to continuously avoid bumping into him/her. You&#39;re are correct but on a different level of the theory of time travel. In this case he would bump into himself because he&#39;s going back to the same locale, same time, same people. There&#39;s no way he could not bump into himself. 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just trying to prove a point. I actually like the look of this film but after getting an A* in Physics it&#39;s kinda what I&#39;m good at.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ, so many Steven Hawkins comments here, yet antoher one. This movie is not about time travel!!! It&#39;s not suppose to be a Discovery Channel science documentary, it&#39;s about choices you make in life that define you, how you learn from your mistakes, and how you strive to be happy all the time.So what&#39;s the point in looking for scientific inconsistences in it???
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitalike my comment if 0:48 reminds you of Harry potter and the deathly of Hallows when the Minister Rufus Scrimingeour ( Bill Nighty) gave the Snitch, the Tales of Beedle the Bard book and the Lighter to our Heroes and asked Harry to undone the Snitch :) 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaYou assuming that&#39;s how it works.  Who&#39;s to say going back doesn&#39;t just create a different timeline, so you&#39;d never bump into your past self
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaomg me too haha 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaWow the trailer already made me tearful xx
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitathis is already done in Groundhog Day
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaMan, I really liked this trailer and I will be seeing this for sure. Don&#39;t know how there&#39;s such comments already complaining about time traveling issues, this is not what the movie is about. 

Films like Back to the Future are about the inconsistency of time travel, Butterfly Effect too, this is about things we want to change in our lifes, our mistakes in the pasts, and how this define us as the person we are today. 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaSo how many people went into a dark place and tried it?

T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re forgetting it takes place in England. So wizards tend to account for all the plot holes.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaNo!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaThis film does not take any of the rules of time travel into effect. If he kept going back to kiss that girl on new years, to compliment McAdams twice and to shag her twice he should really be running into his past self each time. Like Doc Brown says &quot;The encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space time continuum, and destroy the entire universe!&quot; As a film this looks good but the science is all wrong.  
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaOf Monsters And Men - Lakehouse
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaThe Vow + Time Traveler&#39;s Wife............. still Rachel McAdams..... okay
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great feel good comedy.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really cool.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaTime traveler&#39;s wife ......only now he can control it
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d give it a chance!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at the end called
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what the backing track is during 2nd part of trailer?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI wish i could turn back time and never have watched this piece of shit trailer
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve worked it out already they make it to obvious in the trailer
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaon the bright side she didn&#39;t loose her memory again (probably the fourth time if she did). Sort of. I mean he kept changing it but .... damn
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaSo Rachel McAdams falls i love with a man who can travel back in time...again...
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this, looks so good :D
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaDark but if you like that sort of thing

T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams likes men who time travels lol
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitais that russell crow at 2:18
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaJá tem um filme mais ou menos assim só que um pouco mais dramático com a própria Rachel e com Eric Bana não?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI really don&#39;t wanna watch a movie where two grown men bitch and cry about how they can go back in time and do whatever the fuck they want.
Man the fuck up!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams you can&#39;t go wrong!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaWhether you are Domhnall Gleeson or Eric Bana or Channing Tatum or Ryan Gosling, things like time and place is of no concern, you are bound to fall in love with beautiful Rachel McAdams no matter what :) 
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaYeah rachel mcadams loves time traveles it seems...
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaLakehouse by of monster and man

T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaThere is something wrong with you.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitamovie looks cool yet weird
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaRon weasly and Hermione Granger  :D
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaSo after Eric Bana she hooked up with another time traveler?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitanow thats a movie to watch 4 sure

T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaBut why would he want to do that and why would you even think of that?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks awesome!!!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaSuperpowers and Rachel McAdams. This is my life&#39;s dream!!! :P
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams.. i love this girl
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitamovie looks interesting
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaI know it&#39;s a film but how does this plank get to be with her?!
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaA more quirky English take on Butterfly Effect?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaDomnhall Gleeson &lt;3
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams really is good at forgetting, isn&#39;t she?
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitathis doesn&#39;t look like a rip off it looks like a child &quot;the butterfly effect&quot; X time &quot;travelers wife&quot;&#39;s had
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaLol hasn&#39;t Rachel McAdams done this before.
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitatumbnails hot
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t that bill Weasley??
T7A810duHvwdelimeterByIshitabasically the time travelers wife, they should have picked a better lead actor.

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaYes. It has been confirmed that the Klingon Empire will be a factor in &quot;Darkness&quot;.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaThe ship just got real.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaIt does look like the &#39;reimagined&#39; BoP from the official Prequel comic.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshita0:44 Cryogenic/Stasis tubes? 1:32, Klingons or guys in suits?

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaToo many spoilers!!! Fuck!!!
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaasdfghjkl i need to see the movie!!!!am i the only one to realize that this is like the second time Benict Cumberbatch&#39;s character is against a dude named Jim?i think is kinda funny...anyway,i want to see the movie so i can hear more of Benedict&#39;s beautiful voice,and see him kicking someone&#39;s ass(as usual...)i don&#39;t care if he&#39;s the bad guy,he still is awesome kicking people&#39;s butt :)
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Shall we begin?&quot; YES!!!!

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaI am so proud of my little boy
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitai dont even like star treck and im totally gonna watch this shit. 
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaI wish this was going to be in a 4DX theater.... But then I&#39;ll have to fly to Asia to watch it. Along with IronMan 3 (The 1st Action film for 4DX.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitathere are some star trek fans who simply don&#39;t like JJ&#39;s vision of the Star Trek universe and it&#39;s understandable why. This does not look like what Star Trek was for 50 years. It&#39;s something else and that&#39;s not ok with some people.

I happen to like it, but I understand those who don&#39;t. 
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaI wish you would shut up and go away, you idiot.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaMUST SEE NOW
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is much much better than the previous iteration.  You find out the stakes while not getting much story. This is the way to do it.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaSherlock Holmes ... back from the dead.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaAlmost looks like a Abrams version of a Sovereign Class Starship @1:15!
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaholy shiiiit!!!!!!!....i hope this new series can impress all of you like it impress me.....it remembers me of the old series! i hope the series will continue ....Star Trek Rules!!!!!!!!! 
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaI mean holy

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaDid I just see the whole movie with this trailer??? o.0
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT! this trailer is fucking awesome!!!!
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitait could be somekind of Excelsior Prototype. In one trailer it is said that Cumberbatch is one of the best Agents in Starfleet so he could have stolen the prototype of the new excelsior class and since it is another universe everything looks different
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaI wanted to see an epic Klingon battle in this film. :(
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to......Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s voice.
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitatl;dr people jumping from high things

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshita1:16 - USS Excelsior!? :o
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie has any &quot;time travel&quot; bullshit in it I am going to scream! and then likely go see it regardless. 
QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;....translation......My bad, I....I done fucked up........pretty much 1:14 onwards.

QAEkuVgt6AwdelimeterByIshitaSorry if i&#39;m gonna offend anybody

gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOh my holy God...
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like they are copying certain parts of The Gladiator.<br><br>I mean; &quot;Are we having fun now brother!?&quot; feels just like the line &quot;Are you not entertained?!&quot; from The Gladiator.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaSorry pero nada que ver con la de Charlton Heston mil veces unica y mejor, por algo gano 11 oscar a pesar que no tenian los efectos especiales de hoy.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaBahahhahaa. This ALREADY reeks of B-movie.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitajacks a great actor but i dont respect this remake, they cant really do anything the much loved original didnt do
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitasuch blasphemy!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaSharknado is better. More deep.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen this sort of shit in ages
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitathe phantom menace&#39;s pod-racing scene looks more like Ben-Hur than this
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshita2 Ben 2 Hurious
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitajpp
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaХватит переснимать. Оставьте классику в покое. Не доверяйте Бекмамбетову. Он может снимать только рекламу.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWhy?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaUgh....Why remake the Charles Heston classic and the 70mm chariot race.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck with all these shitty remakes!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaAwaiting for the Michael Bay remake of Casablanca. What the fuck is Morgan Freeman doing in the Roman Empire? C&#39;mon let&#39;s thumb down this little shit to Ghostbusters level.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitagosthbusters and this one has a lot of hate
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be bad. You can&#39;t remake  a classic movie like this and expect the reactions from viewers to be good.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI can recognize the sound of those drums anywhere!!!!! This is great news....
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaif this doesnt awaken zombie charlton heston holding his gun, nothing will......
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaanother white jesus.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaYeah... Fuck this shit.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNO NO NO NO NO NO! Someone, please delete this movie from every hard drive and burn every roll of film!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOH FOR FUCKS SAKE PEOPLE! stop shitting on it. This is not a REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE!! this is another adaptation of the frucking  book. For fucks sake, 95% of you have not even seen the original movie and i am quite sure most of you didnt even know the movie is based on a book
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaRemaking Ben-Hur is like remaking Titanic. It would take way to much effort to improve upon it, and none of it is applied here.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI felt physically uncomfortable when watching this &quot;trailer&quot;.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for The Godfather remake.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOh yeah another remake,<br>Let&#39;s shit on it EVEN IF WE HAVEN&#39;T SEEN IT YET.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWhat its this remake a VFX show? or what. the firts movie whitouth vfx ts much better like this BEN-VFX
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaTurning Ben Hur into a bad Fast and Furious clone. That&#39;s amazing in the same terrible way Trump for President is amazing.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitalooks like they killed the original movie
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaCharlton Heston is spinning in his grave. what&#39;s next ten commandments?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll give it a chance
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshita99% of the people condemning this trailer have probably never even seen the classic.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOMG NO. NO!  NOOOOO!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaBATMAN YEAR 0
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI loved the original. Have it on DVD at home. This looks really great for today&#39;s time. As long as they stick to the story and the dramatics, I&#39;m happy. . Damn, now I need to rewatch it.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis is remake has crossed the line!!!!! Why would they do this?!?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThe 1959 movie was a remake, too.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHorrible.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaDisgusting.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitawhats with the geeetar music?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaLike Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur is one of those movie you just don&#39;t remake.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaTerrible trailer: &quot;Ben-Hur, a cgi orgy&quot;. Razzie Winner.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaSo... Morgan Freeman stars as Whoopi Goldberg?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaОчень неровный трейлер. Эпические сцены с графикой супер, а вот каст и игра актёров - что-то не то.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNO! GOD NO! Oh Please! Don&#39;t! For The Love Of God!!!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHOT-GARBAGE
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaits a wonder they haven&#39;t remade gone with the wind.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awful! The 1939 version is a friggin classic this looks like trash.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWho the fuck do they think they are? At least Prince of Egypt had a new angle on it to differentiate itself from The Ten Commandments.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for the &quot;Ben Hur Flops At The Box Office&quot; headlines. NO ONE is going to see this. The people who know the Charlton Heston version won&#39;t go and everyone else won&#39;t go, because Spider-man isn&#39;t in it.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaPlease sack the person who made this trailer is it ben hur or 300 part 3 or gladiator 2
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaYet another remake that already looks destined to flop.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaBob Marley vs Doctor Doom.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitadont mess with the classicsssssss
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaGarbage.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNeed for speed in the olden days
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaCGI garbage plus horn in the trailer. Always an indication of quality.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHollywood pls
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThat looks...actually, that looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Love the original, but I&#39;ll give this a chance.  Looks like a quality production at least.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaanother failure is coming ! hahaa
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOY VEY WHY ARE THEY PORTRAYING THE ROMANS AS WHITE??
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHorrible.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI kept waiting for Morgan to say... &quot;Ben-Hur.. my friend.&quot;
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the worst trailers of all time.....this is going to bomb HARD!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaYo guys, this movie is going to be awesome. That horse race looked great.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHow to rape a classic movie. Bravo Paramount, good job...
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWho the hell thinks it´s a good idea to make a remake of a film that just untouchable??? What´s next? Lord of the Rings or Titanic?<br>Jeez
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaAlso Morgan Freeman or John Travolta from battlefield earth whatever... its gonna bomb big time
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaFlop immediately!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitajust terrible even I love both actors just looks horrid...
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI call this trailer the death of cinema as we know it.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWtf with this thing?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know about Ben Hur 2016 over the old classic one but Morgen freeman in it. I am up for it.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI thought Tom Huddleston was in this movie .But he is not .
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaCan Morgan Freeman play anything else than the magic-negro?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer was fine but why is the actor playing Ben Hur doing his best Batman impression? lol
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThe new Gods of Egypt.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaI plan on getting the Charlton Heston version on video soon
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitawhat a waste
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaCould morgan freeman&#39;s hair be more ridiculous?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaAUGUST!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaWhat the FUCK is this??
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNo thanks you can keep it
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t like the tone this trailer has, it&#39;s just action without the epicness of a story
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitathis looks much better than that Gods of Egypt crap
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitagame of thrones meets fast and furious
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis is just crapping all over the 1959 version, nothing can top it.<br><br>I&#39;ll still be watching this though.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThe new season of Spartacus looks pretty-....Wait, this is BEN-HUR?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNobody asked for this and you don&#39;t just remake a timeless classic. This is destined to fail and suck hard.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaHow many Razzies will be nominated this movie?
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaLooks great.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaNOW THIS.... THIS IS PODRACING.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t fuck with the classics.
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks way Better than the trailer they gave us
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaMy name is Morgan Freeman
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaIt is an amazing trailer!
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the first human being to watch this trailer
gLJdzky63BAdelimeterByIshitapas mal
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaWell, that&#39;s the better song of the two.
The other is a just some trash by the Ting Tings.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitajust saw the movie...stunning, loved it
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitais this movie in the states?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis movie will be nominated for a oscar...i will fight for it. amazing
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaNo, I mean Danny Boyle...
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI think you mean Dev Patel
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaDanny Boyle is getting attention... he will be one of the greatest directors of these years...
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitait looks like its a lot different than the book,and i really loved that book.but it looks good,and i really want to see it.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaYeah, this movie is amazing! Everybody should watch :D
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitadownload from where
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaQ&amp;A (The book that inspired this) fried my brain. In a bad way. I read it last night after watching this trailer. 

Spoilers-

Torture, Gay Pedo, more Gay Pedo, Incest, Limb Butchering, Communal Riots, Murder, Dacoity, murder again, Adultery, Drug Use, Espionage, Curses, Voodoo murder, More adultery, Disease, prostitution, suicide, Torture again, murderous vengeance,  and there was also a Contract Killer in between. 

All that was bit much for 1 day and the ending was weak.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie of the weekend and it was just simply fantastic.  If this movie interests you, don&#39;t do anymore research on this movie and just watch it.  You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI WANT TO WATCH THIS!!!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThe song is &quot;Great Dj&quot; from &quot;The Ting Tings&quot;
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI saw this over the weekend, and it&#39;s one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.  Stunning, amazing, heart-wrenching, uplifting..... just AMAZING.   I got all teary and goosebump-y just watching the trailer again.  GO AND SEE IT!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie over the weekend and it was fantastic!  I&#39;m not going to share the details of the movie to those that plan to watch it, but it was definately one of the better movies I have seen this year.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaOscar award is for ...... Cannes is the best awards this movie need to get
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks GOOD.

i want to see it.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaJust saw it in Dallas. BLOWN THE F AWAY. The trailer doesn&#39;t do it justice. Its not what you expect, it&#39;s better. Sometimes you get a small glimpse at a pattern of humanity the interweaves us all. This film taps on such a painfully gorgeous cruelty in life&#39;s circumstances the culminates into hope from tragedy that we all can take note from.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good! i&#39;m going to have to go and see it!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaomg looks so cute.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThat girl is soooo hot!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitayeah everyone i talked to said the movie was great. But this trailer is cheesy.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitarecien la vida y la raja definitivamente la raja,
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaits actually a really good movie, the trailer is shit though makes it look really corny and cliche
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathe trailer really does not represent how amazing and original the movie really is
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s by the Ting Tings i think
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaAnyone knows what is the song clip played at the very beginning of the trailer?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaMillions was kind of a miss for me.  It had potential but wasn&#39;t anywhere as good as trainspotting and 28 days later IMO.  I haven&#39;t seen Sunshine though...probably should.  I was just talking to somebody last night about how 28 days later was without a doubt one of the best zombie movies ever made.

Dear god I need to see Slumdog though...
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaBe INSPIRED!
YouTube: 24 24 Hour Gyms In 24 Days
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaHave to wait till Dec 26th to see it in australia...why?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitai heard it&#39;s like 2/3 hindi 1/3 english
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThe Ting Tings-Great DJ
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI urge you all to go see this as soon as possible.  It&#39;s a completely fantastic movie and the best I&#39;ve seen all year.

Fox Searchlight, put this in wide release now.  The word of mouth is obviously fantastic...it&#39;ll pay off.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing cant wait &lt;3
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie yesterday,
and It was amazing.
the director was there for Q&amp;A.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitawhere do we go to see it?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI really wanna see this!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitabest movie ive ever seen...wow a STANDING APPLAUSE AT THE END FOLKS
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSigur Ros- Hoppípolla
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitalicoln plaza or angelika
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitait is
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD ITS ANWAR
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaOscar worthy!  just saw it in maryland...the audience left jubliant...with smiles on their faces.  Best $10 I&#39;ve ever spent on a movie.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not involved in the entertainment industry. Too bad because if I were, I&#39;d be standing on my soapbox screaming at the top of my lungs that this film should be the odds-on favorite to win the Best Picture Oscar. I think the last film that caused me to not be able to move from my seat, even as the end credits had finished rolling, was City Of God. Though there are scenes that will have you peering through the slits of your fingers, you will never be able to take your eyes off the screen.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaA flawless film...it makes the heart soar! To see again and again!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaBBC Radio 4 did an adaptation of the story for radio and have to say it was the best drama I had heard for a long time made me cry at the end
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaFunny, I saw this film tonight in San Francisco

The most honest film to come out in a long time.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best films of the year.  RUN, don&#39;t walk to see this.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie last night in San Francisco.  It is one of the best films ever made.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitait based on the book &quot;Q and A&quot;
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSen008 you can see it where I saw it last night...at the Angelika or Lincoln Center in Manhattan. It was an amazing movie...left me speechless.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathe movie sounds like it is loosely inspired by the book &#39;Q and A&#39;...i think
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a really good story and I want to watch it. Is it rated R because of the violence?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaFound it! Thanks anyway.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know where the music at 0:38 is from?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaA truly wonderful film...definitely worth
at least 9 Kirpans out of 10 on my rating
scale!!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThe images look very similar to those in Salaam Bombay and Split Wide open. I loved both the movies, looking forward to watching this one as well.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI am 25 years old and i have never seen such a wonderfully directed, acted film in my life...Hands down to Danny Boyle and A R Rahman...I wish i could see more films like this in the future..
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!!!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good!  i wish it weren&#39;t in only select theaters.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaWatching this tomorrow, not playing in many places here in toronto though :S just one theatre...

AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitanice
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitai have to watch this movie.!!!!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaWent to a PGA screening of the movie yesterday in NYC. POWERFUL, Moving, cinematic, colorful, ambient. Had a great opportunity to meet Danny Boyle, the stars Dev Patel, Frida, who all seemed genuiely thrilled about the film as well.. If you get a chance please go see this movie.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!  Gonna see it opening day.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be great. I can&#39;t wait to see it.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSigur Ros is a Ice-land band and you just listen to their song called Hoppipolla. It was the last song of this trailer.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaA band from Iceland, the last song you hear with the piano is them.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitayay its anwar from skins! im glad devon&#39;s got other work since skins ended

AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitayip, thats sigur ros. this movie looks amazing - does anyone know when it opens in south afica?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitacool i&#39;m just curious do you pronounce sigur ros &quot;sig ger raws&quot;
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaSKINS SKIN SKINS i wanna watch this
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshita...wow.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaThe beauty of Boyle&#39;s movies are his visual imagery and music. Looks like its gonna be a two thumbs up in that field :D
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitado i hear sigur ros in second half of trailor ;)
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaI bet at the end he doesn&#39;t get the money but he gets the girl!!!
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaWho is the asshole marking down every positive comment for this trailer?
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaWow it actually looks interesting. Anil Kapoor hahaha and the kid from Skins. Nice. I&#39;ll definitely check it out.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitalooks like a movie to get high on
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaLooks absolutely amazing. Plus, I love Dev Patel.
AIzbwV7on6QdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to it. I love Danny Boyle&#39;s films.

qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshita&quot;That was Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;<br>&quot;How did she get on the radio?&quot;<br>Hahahaha
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING MOVIE! i totally recommend it
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaSTOP WITH THE DAMN ADS ITS GETTING ANNOYING!!!!!!👿👿👿👿👿
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaCorrect me if I am wrong but this whole movie seems to me, to be about a rich woman with little musical talent paying people to let her dream come true.😂
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaOh, good grief. Another Oscar nomination roll-out. Merle Streep is simply the best.
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaThanks for condensing the entire film into the trailer.
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitano.
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaHappy Birthday, Meryl!
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s kind of a rip-off from the French film Marguerite from last year. Like, it&#39;s the exact same plot, with locations changed
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
qth6y8SrXNYdelimeterByIshitaOh, le remake de Marguerite, mais avec le personnage d&#39;inspiration original

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is one of the most epic action movie you could ever seen. Look at young james agh even trailer makes me wanna watch it again
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI watched the movie did not like it so I can say it totally sucked.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitanice
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita<b>SPOILER ALERT</b><br>Anyone else found hidden messages in the film? I found one when he went to work and discovers a note on the post about the Trash and rats behind it is a poster that says &quot;Your Father&#39;s (Son)&quot; before he looked at the house across his Apartment which belonged to his well Father.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the most fun and awesome movie ever! Go watch it, you&#39;ll love it!
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Shoot this mother fucker&quot; are the most un natural words to come out of Morgan Freeman&#39;s mouth

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitai love james so much
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this (McAvoy fan here) and I must say I enjoyed it waaay more than I thought I would, even though I watched on my laptop. The stunts were pretty cool, and I love an action movie with lots of comic relief. I rate this a 7 out of 10 - but keep in mind I don&#39;t watch a lot of action movies, so it might rate a little lower with those who do. Anyway, it&#39;s definitely worth watching.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitathis is so laggy
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaSplit reminded me of this
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitacurve the bullet rofl
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitasloan is a gullible fuck, lol
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitathis movie sucks but Im watching it right now so I need to finish it.  The train derailing scene was fake as shit.

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaAngelina is my bay. I&#39;m just in love with this woman, who is 22 years older than me . Oh God!!!
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitato different from the comic book. supposed to be villans that killed off at the batman types and now run things however they made it pg
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edpEspHOeVU&amp;t=2m01s">2:01</a> Fuck you :D
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI fuck with this movie so hard.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edpEspHOeVU&amp;t=1m23s">1:23</a> I thought It was Gordon Ramsay XDDD
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaThe only lie in this trailer is google &#39;no results&#39;
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve said it before and I will say it again; Angelina Jolie was born for this fucking movie.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaYeah... this is not in HD.  I am missing something here?
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaANGELINA JOLIE IS SO HOT AS ALWAYS
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaRIPPED OF FIGHT CLUB THIS FILMS IS HORSE SHIT
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie, i think wesley is cool....n cute😂

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaMorgan freeman and james mcavoy simply majestic:):)
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaInb4 bullets cant be curved
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitait reminds me pretty much Matrix
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaFinally a fucking trailer that doesn&#39;t show the whole movie and the main plot in it...
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaWatching this movie high was like another worldly experience, under recommend it if you guys haven&#39;t...

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaOne of my fav movies actually, it was thought provoking.Though I didn&#39;t really like the ending ):
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Kill one,save a thousand.&quot;
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie.  It&#39;s really straightforward.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaThis seems kind of similar to Kingsman but with baby James McAvoy
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitawhen James McAvoy still looks very young
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edpEspHOeVU&amp;t=0m39s">0:39</a> FEGELIEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaCurving bullets.... that&#39;s surely a weird thing to do.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaAhhh people complaining about job. Damn, at least you have one!!! Appreciate!
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaBadass Movie !!!
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI really am curious to know why Angelina Jolie Lost so much weight for this movie ? 
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitagreat movie. but it&#39;s got almost nothing to do with the comic book
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edpEspHOeVU&amp;t=0m08s">0:08</a> chris pratt
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaMORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitawow this movie was amazing
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaCurved bullets. That&#39;s the moment when anyone who finished elementary school should walk outta the theater.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaIts not Morgan Freeman movie director is Russian tho i dont remember his full name Timur idk what, anyway its wrong to call it Morgan Freeman movie, and yes i watched it on 2008 it was cool
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaLove this one , have watched it like 10 times
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a really good film - one of those ones where you just accept what&#39;s happening; don&#39;t question it.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaHas anyone complied a montage of the action scenes? Reckon that would be enough for me to be honest
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaAll of these mark millar movies have a pattern for some reason
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaworth to watch ?
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie, i didnt expect it to be good to be honest. Boring at first but interesting after a little while.

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaExcellent movie. Very funny and insiding.<br>McAvoy caries it like complete pro.
edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshitaJames is HAWT

edpEspHOeVUdelimeterByIshita360p the new HD of the century

3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitasong?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitathe song is Lights &amp; Motion - Reanimation (Full Album)
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaIf I have to see that fucking Carrie Dee commercial one more time...
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThey really wanted Liam Neeson
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaname of the soundtrack theme ?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshita&quot;Criminal&quot;: That one time that Commissioner Gordon, Wonder Woman, Deadpool, Two-Face and Jonathan Kent made a movie together.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGary oldman and Michael Pitt in a movie together I think I just died I&#39;m dead Mason overload RIP
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaKevin Costner is back!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaI need this song.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer seems to tell all. What will people go to watch.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaCant find the song at the end. Does anybody know??
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaمتى ينزل ؟؟؟
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitakinda has a taken vibe but seems interesting
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaOne of the few movies i&#39;ll pay to go see this year.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGeriatrics unlimited
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitawow never would of thought of this concept but i can definitely see a criminal 2
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThis has the same exact concept of self/less so...
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvnoqsvY-M&amp;t=1m24s">1:24</a> Come to my channel and say Hi to the sniper ^-^
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaJust tell me it won&#39;t be PG-13, because what I saw looks very promising.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaYeah this is cool and all but ah how&#39;s that power ranger Movie coming along💀💀
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty good if they stay with the theme that a criminal isn&#39;t so clearly defined in the end. guy was bad and crazy before but maybe he too can be good guy
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshita&#39;selfless &#39; with music
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaaaaand in the end, He remembers everything
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitarelease date  ?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaKeep that website up and you wont get 1 penny you UGLY NO TALENT LOSER. you steal from unsuspecting women.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaAlice Eve doesn&#39;t appear in this trailer. Why not?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThere are too many good actors in this to have that cheesy plane explosion
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m in
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaVing rhames: <a href="https://vimeo.com/125531762">https://vimeo.com/125531762</a>
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, this looks really good.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaWhy spoil such a major plot point like that in this trailer? God fucking damnit Lionsgate, that great storytelling just thrown out the window.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaSafe House 2
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a thriller with a great cast. With Kevin Costner I know it will be great!!!!!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaCostner looks good  for a guy in his early 60&#39;s
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGod I hope this is good.  Vromen got lucky with his Richard Kuklinski biopic, I&#39;m not sure how he&#39;ll fare with this though considering all the talent involved.  I feel like Duncan Jones should be the one directing this.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitalooks like fucking rl black ops
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaJason Bourne&#39;s father
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitagonna seem weird but I can see Costner playing Cable in the next Deadpool flick
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaI have one question: Does Tommy Lee Jones set up a perimeter?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitamy new track <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/elijah-th3-messenger/tearz-of-a-nigga">https://m.soundcloud.com/elijah-th3-messenger/tearz-of-a-nigga</a>
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks nice...but am i the only one who see similarity with &quot;SELF/LESS&quot; with Ryan Reynolds in major role?)Criminals looks like a sequel of &quot;SELF/LESS&quot; or some kinda a remake)))
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaSelf/less 2: Criminal. I guess.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitai like it!!!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaI just have one question: does Tommy Lee Jones set up a perimeter?..
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaMeh. Just another 6/10 movie... if that.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitawow jim gordon right there ?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitathis looks like COD BO 1
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaSo John Kent, Wonder Woman, Deadpool, Commissioner Gordon, and Two-Face all in one movie.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaWhat a cast, what a story. I&#39;m in. Looks great.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaPa Kent, Commissioner Gordon, Two Face, Wonder Woman, and Deadpool stars in Taken 4: Dawn of X-Force
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaNeed donors. Please support. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/media-company-startup/x/13329622#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/media-company-startup/x/13329622#/</a>

3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaYu know why? Cause am a CRIMINAL!!!   CRIMINAL!!!   Criminal!!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThe Iceman was excellent.  I&#39;m looking forward to this one.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvnoqsvY-M&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a>
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting. Hopefully the plot won&#39;t be full of holes...
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLove this trailer. Looks amazing and touching :D<br>Btw, Gal gadot is so adorable &lt;3
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGerriaction 2: Retiree Boogaloo
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaomg Michael Pitt and Gary Oldman in same movie omg
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitakevin ,gary and tommy best hollywood sensations
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaI never thought I&#39;d say this.  Maybe too intense?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson stuck in Kevin Costner&#39;s body?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S THE CLOSEST THING TO A DEADPOOL / WONDER WOMAN TEAM-UP WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET !
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaKevin Costner, Gary Oldman, and Tommy Lee Jones = It&#39;s a &quot;JFK&quot; reunion!! :)
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaI AM WAITING THIS FILM- LOOKED VERY COOL
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitavolte face remake
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitadid they seriously just make karl pilkington&#39;s movie idea?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t about Jimmy Darmody
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie. To those who have seen &quot;Selfless&quot; with Ryan Reynolds, this movie Mirrors that. Seems almost like the same plot..... Will watch it either way.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks deadly! Costner is the man, like a fine wine he gets better as the years pass by!!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGal looks incredible in this trailer.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaLooks professionally made, but, most of the sequences in this trailer have been seen in other films before. If you haven&#39;t watched those other action films then.....
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaWould everyone just stop with the stupid superhero jokes and just take a moment to look at the amazing cast this has and what a dramatic turn in roles this is for Kevin Costner?!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaHell yes this looks good
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer reminded me of Black Ops 1.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaJFK cast back together hahaha
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaliked
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaSo Green Lantern marries WonderWoman, then  he dies and his mind its put inside Pa Kent, went insane and Comisioner Gordon and Harvey Dent are hunting him?.<br><br>Edit: Wow, I just realized Faora its also on this  film!. How awesome its dat!
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaScott Adkins! :D
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitawowowow
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THE SOUNDTRACK TOWARDS THE END??!?!?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot can&#39;t act they say...<br><br>She is gonna kill it as Wonder Woman.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitascott adkins again:) i hope not too short on this film.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaseeing this movie
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer, looking forward to it! Gary Oldman, Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones reunited (JFK)
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaAmazing cast.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaIn an alternate universe, Deadpool is married to Wonder Woman
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s goin on with Costner&#39;s voice? Is the dude a heavy smoker?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaCan I just say that I&#39;m enjoying the second half of Costner&#39;s career?
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaNever thought Gal Gadot was that attractive but she looks absolutely beautiful in this trailer.
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot! &lt;3
3bvnoqsvY-MdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer! :)

R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaFnaf the movie ????????????
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaDepp will get the Oscar for this. The studio is already campaigning HARD for this one. Looks great.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaim really looking forward to seeing this, but the music in the trailers dont seem to fit the movie
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with the makeup used? They look so weird. The freckles and the powdered look :s and Johnny&#39;s eyes look fake and his face looks powdered. Seems like a good movie though.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yela">#yela</a>  da king
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaStupid song choice...keep the theme and feel of the movie right and stop tryin to be hip...I&#39;d fire who ever chose that song. It&#39;s a mafia movie ffs. Ruined the trailer for me. Good thing the other two trailers already made me jizz for this movie. can&#39;t wait for this movie
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaDo you think the guys who made this trailer saw the trailer for The Wolf of Wall Street? lol
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThe excellent Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Depp in the same film! Looking forward to this!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaNow that&#39;s a fucking trailer.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_F-lVhSfx8&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> Joker&#39;s laugh <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_F-lVhSfx8&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> Joker&#39;s slow clapping <br><br>No wonder why Christopher Nolan himself called Depp to play the joker in the dark Knight rises after Ledger&#39;s death, but Nolan thought it&#39;d be better not to make a joker in his movies again as a respect for his late freind Heath Ledger who has done one of the best classic performances of all time.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s wrong with these people saying wrong song choice? Are you here to judge the background song of this trailer or to see if the movie is wroth to watch? Smh 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s jhonny depp? 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhen I saw the link for this on machinima when they were talking about the DC universe, i thought they said this movie was called &quot;black mask&quot;. I was like &quot;wow, that would actually seem like a pretty interesting movie about him&quot;
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_F-lVhSfx8&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a>, Joker is that you ?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp is faceless man.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI want her<br>
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaLooks good. Excited to watch it
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaIs it just me or do the male characters got an injection of extra cheekbones in this movie?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaanyone know where i can find new trailers like this with closed captions? My dad has a hard time hearing but he loves to watch all the new trailers with me
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp, Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton. <br>All my favorite actor are in 1 film.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWe get it people you don&#39;t like the music 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer reveals more but it really should have kept the theme of the teaser trailers. They made it looked thrilling and dark and awesome. This trailer kind of makes it look like a wolf of Wall Street rap or something
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaOscars are coming…
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThe song is yelawolfs till it&#39;s gone, great song they chopped it for this trailer though 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaMeth Damon.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitalooks so fucking bad.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhy johnydeep didn&#39;t play as joker?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaeveryone and their mother is in this movies
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitadid they get froggy fresh to do the music?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitalooks great, shame about the shit track in the back of this trailer though... awful
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaBenedict Cumberbatch my good man, you&#39;re in the movie!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaGive him an Oscar! Johnny Depp♥ I am dying to see this film and more because the world&#39;s sexiest man Johnny Depp works.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWTF is up with that awful music, the marketing department really fucked up a second good trailer, I hope this trend dies, just to appeal to younger audiences, really? what a shame
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita Yelawolf! Moving on up in the world, just like he deserves ❤️
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaLeo thinks some face mask gonna get him an Oscar.<br>Maybe next time Leo
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI find this trailer redundant. The Teaser trailer was the best and all I needed to see.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis looks frightening!  I want to see Johnny D. slap some people around, gangster style!!  :D
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWow the music in this trailer is absolutely horrendous almost made it unwatchable, the movie looks Great.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitabentdick cuminsnatch is looking great
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaчто то с лицами не то...в этом фильме
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaOnce again, another all white cast.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWait a hot minute. Depp giving his performance of the year. After Mordecai in January this looks real good. Smell Oscar nom in the air too
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaRay Donovan told me!...<br>actually Micky*
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaClick like if you came from the black ops 3 multiplayer trailer 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitadamnit i thought it said Black Mesa lol.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaDAKOTA😍😍😍😍👌
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI liked the trailer however I didn&#39;t like how they stole the song from the Black Ops 3 Trailer called Til It&#39;s Gone
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for Benedict Cumberbatch :3
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaname of song?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic. Can&#39;t wait for it.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaSo..... is Depp really going to be in this Halloween costume the whole film?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhy does fucking Benedict Cumberbatch have to be in everything now? I hate the twat.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWow. This and Jobs are the movies I most look forward to the rest of this year. 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI see you Johnny Depp... reaching more than Leonardo since What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape lmao. I just can&#39;t see him with an Oscar. But keep trying mate!!! <br>Amazing cast!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s what i call a cast.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis is too awesome a movie for a hip hop pop song, looks incredible, please don&#39;t mix the tone of the movie with a song that doesn&#39;t quite feel the same. Still Can&#39;t wait to see this film!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThe story of every mob boss.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaCould this really be a good movie with Johnny Depp? After 2004?! Let&#39;s hope so
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SLUMERICAN">#SLUMERICAN</a>
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp&#39;s redemption
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaHow many movies has Johnny Depp been in where you don&#39;t recognize him, or don&#39;t know if its even him or not unless the trailer says so? Seriously, you&#39;d think Johnny Depp &amp; Tim Burton are working together again, but no, this film has a different director.<br><br>Makes me wonder why hasn&#39;t Johnny Depp ever been given the role as The Joker? Imagine if he was The Joker, he&#39;d steal the show, and you wouldn&#39;t know what kind of performance he&#39;d give.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like it is truly going to be awesome!<br>Too bad the music in the trailer is horrible
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhen You noticed this song is better the the original 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t know Benjamin Cucumberhatch was in this film.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI feel as Ray Liotta could play this role better. But that&#39;s my opinion.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhat was wrong with <b>The Departed</b>? :-\
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaMovie looks great!  What a horrible song for the trailer though. Completely detracts from the weight of the subject matter.  Hope they axe it.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI loved it when Corey Stoll said, &quot;Everything.&quot;
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaOMG I remember  “Whitey” Bulger... We live so near and I have heard stories that gives me nightmares about him... Especially throwing dead people in Marina Bay a Bay near my old house....
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp hats off love u benedict cumberbatch love u too much<br>
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWith all these different racial films coming out, it annoys the nerve out of me to know how many people treat racial discrimination as the only type of discrimination.  There are minorities even today (and I&#39;m one of them) who the law doesn&#39;t protect against discrimination and who activism doesn&#39;t support.  If race is all you think about, you don&#39;t deserve to be an activist.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaIMO The trailer without the music is WAAAAAY better than this one. This song cheapens the movie...
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhat a cast
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaGreat cast! 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaYELAWOLF!!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWe need to kick Depp out of Hollywood. He&#39;s no longer the actor he was in the 90&#39;s.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaWhats the song that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_F-lVhSfx8&amp;t=0m57s">0:57</a> anyone know?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis is the scariest Johnny Depp I have ever seen....
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI had to give you a dislike for using BO3 song... I know  I still lovez you!&gt; ...WB.P
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaIs that Todd from breaking bad? 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitayelawolf..
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaMeth Damon?!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaYelawolf - Till It&#39;s Gone
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaThis film looks brilliant. 
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaGood trailer but don&#39;t like the song they used.... Other than that can&#39;t wait to see it
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaKing Kong&#39;s dick is a Black Mass...<br><br><br>Sorry about that.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaTodd de Breaking Bad?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI love this song. I first heard it in Sons of Anarchy Season 7 Episode 2. I believe the song is Till It&#39;s Gone by Yelawolf.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaIf Johnny have made more movies like this in the past few years he&#39;d have won an Oscar by now 😔 it&#39;s sad he doesn&#39;t use his talent on his good.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp in the best performance of his career.... O.O
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaFinally Depp puts some effort. Mortdecai was an incredible low-point.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaI like the dinner scene from first trailer. Garlic powder.
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaNice
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshita This is the best trailer out of the three!! Johnny boy, here comes that Oscar nod!
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaTrailer Song?
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaIts good to see Johnny Depp putting in effort for the first time in years
R_F-lVhSfx8delimeterByIshitaOscar nomination Johnny Depp. 
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitasince when is WWE studios a thing?
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathe girl is Asami from Legend of Korra and Princess Yue from the last airbender movie
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThat was a good movie, I just saw full movie on Movieclips Trailers YouTube channel
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping it would be a magic movie D;
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Disney was making a Mace Windu Prequel!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaoh its a blumhouse produced film.......
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThis would make a much better tv show than movie.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaAs a magician, and a filmmaker... groan.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitado you know this movie is in theatres on 4.7.2017
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitastatics shock???????????????????????????
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitacould have just made a Static Shock movie.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s a Bang Baby
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshita&quot; use the force &quot;
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t heard about Jacob latimore in like 2 to 4 years, I barely recognized him.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThings that don&#39;t bode well for a movie: having the first two reviews come from the same source.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaSeeing all the dum ass comments people can&#39;t see this could actually be a good movie. The main actor has been in a lot of good movies. Looking at the plot and story it seems decent.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORL1d7GWoBc&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a> aw, the kiss of death for any movie....ever.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathis was a perfect chance to make a static shock movie
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThis is so gonna flop
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaMagneto was sleeping around the the hood I guess.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathese comments from these trolls are something else
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitatreyvon martin
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI really hope this is about slight of hand and not super powers.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitastatic shock
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThought this would have something wrestling related after seeing the WWE studios lol
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaFantastic 👍💪
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaBlack kid can do real magic/telekinesis stuff, and he still is stuck in a crappy lifestyle.   Should have been doing some David Blaine type of youtube, he&#39;d get picked up in a heartbeat.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI would say Carrie meets Lucky Number Slevin
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaDidnt think the boy from collateral beauty would actually get anywhere, im happy for him though
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the Iron Man aspect in this? Cuz I don&#39;t see it.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty shit.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaGangster Gus! Psych got dark.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaIt says WWE Studios. Noone in this movie is from WWE
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaFirst time I see superpowers in the hood
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaWatchable
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaStatic Shock&#39;s cousin got a movie.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitalooks as good as american hero
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaAnd his name was... The ShockMaster!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathis dude could play a pharrell williams autobio film
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathe force is strong with this one
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathis looks tight, I&#39;m liking this movie already way to go latimore!  😉👍
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaUh...Static shock much?
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitahow does someone with these abilities have money problems?!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaIs this the kid reincarnated who dies by getting struck by lightning in Chronicle?
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshita&quot;We can do whatever we want, if we could just believe we&#39;re able to&quot;<br><br>Inspiring
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaMore like &quot;Chronicle meet War Machine&quot; amirite ?
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathis move looks Alright i might watch it
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaISSA FLOP
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t they just make a Static Shock movie.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaARE THOSE FONTAINE CARDS?!? 😱 AHH THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE DECKS TO USE
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaFontaine cards
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaDoctor Strange (2016)
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaWwe can&#39;t make a good movie
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaso wwe do movie now
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist, he has electromagnetic powers and is a bang baby, this is a Static Shock Prequel
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI think it looks decent. It has an interesting enough concept to get my attention, so I&#39;ll probably see it.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like three different movies merged into one.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitastatic shock : The movie (also with a changed name plot and back story.......ya know, cuz copyright)
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThis is what happens when Shawn Spencer doesn&#39;t keep Gus in check
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaGus!!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaAW HAIL NAW BLACK MAGIC!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaidk but i like it,probablyyy gonna watch it in april
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaanother teenage hipster with magical powers always ends up in a failure movie
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitalol no one is ganna watch this crap
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s like a vigilante with powers
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaThese comments along with this trailer give me cancer.
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI think Magento had another child he didn&#39;t know about 😂
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitais he a superhero 😂
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaBlack Harry Potter
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaOne of those magnetic aluminium bats I see
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaChronicle meets Boys in the Hood
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitablack magic
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaChronicle meets Moonlight
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaSeems cute, would take my siblings to go see it
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaHood magneto
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitathe twist is that it was all just illusions, which you find out at the end. imo
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaBlack guy, drugs, gangs...YAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWN
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitais this magneto prequel? Then why he is black??
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll go see it. It can&#39;t be any worst than Fifty Shades Darker
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshita100th Like whoaaaa!!!!
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitatyrone messed with the wrong kiddo
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitablack chirnicled

ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaat least it isn&#39;t found footage
ORL1d7GWoBcdelimeterByIshitaStill waiting for Logan trailer #2

AwwbhhjQ9XkdelimeterByIshitaI love so much the fact that the maze is moving with Thomas and Minho inside! I know it&#39;s not in the book, but it looks amazing!<br>And so much Gally, so much Newt!!

AwwbhhjQ9XkdelimeterByIshitaTo whoever thinks that this is a hunger games rip off, read the book. Im pretty sure that nobody lost their memory in the hunger games. Or had a maze with robot slugs that kill people at night. 
AwwbhhjQ9XkdelimeterByIshitaHiring Dylan O&#39;Brien is the best thing they could&#39;ve done

AwwbhhjQ9XkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing! Although the one line from Minho&#39;s character worried me. He couldn&#39;t sound anymore serious? I thought Minho had a deep voice. Atleast, that&#39;s how I imagined it. Other than that, hope the other books get made into films.

4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t even seen the first two!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaDying to watch Ronda kick people&#39;s ass in this movie. 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI thought Jackie Chan would be in this :/
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaEPIC!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitai need this right now. 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaSo I wonder which of the new guys will die in the first 20 minutes again?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song???
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaFinally a real trailer! You have no idea how many times I seen the teaser trailer when I went to the movies.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita[Ignorance intensifies]
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitai bet jet li and arnold wont show up for more than 10 minutes
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna kick....MAJOR.....ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaEminem - Berzerk.

4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaberzerk soundtrack this film? very nice!!!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaYes it is Eminem yo motherfuuuuuuuuckers
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaMolon labe
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaNot enough good fast food movies these days, just art and shit trying to be art. If they keep this series going on until the day every action hero drops dead, I&#39;ll be a happy camper.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaLooks great but dislike that its only going to be a Rating of 12+ in the UK <del>.</del>...first was 18+ then it went down to 15+ now 12+ wtf lol
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitalooks class! how can someone not like stuff like this!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaYay!!!! Arnie and Mel in the same movie soooo excited=D
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita$100 says there is a young rookie who wants I go back to his wife and start a family but dies.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita0.08 what song is that ?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this in english. I feel like I&#39;d miss the &quot;nice blade&quot; joke in french.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait..
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI should have been in this movie since I had as much influence on your childhood development as Stallone
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitabadassssssss.......eminem i got an erection!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaExpendables is not about script, it is not about story well it is but not really, it is all about actors in movie like the Avengers i am Expendables Fan for 4 years can&#39;t wait until i get Unrated AKA Uncut
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita Director: Patrick Hughes will be doing the remake of The Raid..
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaIts PG-13 but it looks pretty decent fun
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaJackie chan?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaYESSS!!! This series could go on forever! :D
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaLooks wicked, definitely one to watch this summer 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitamusic?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaIf it being PG-13 weren&#39;t bad enough, it also looks just plain awful.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaChuck norris please i beg you :(
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaberzerk !
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaROnda ROusey can act?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaя бы назвал фильм &quot;Понты старичков&quot; ))) но все равно +
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita&quot;Last ride&quot;? Say it isn&#39;t so. I want to see these guys do this until they have to start wearing Depends. 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaNeeds michael jai white
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitalmaoo is that the fast and furious font? they just jacked the shit up
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a legend!!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaCan we get Vin &amp; Cube in fourth installment please!!!!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitayou see I knew that this would be better than the expendables 2
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song name? i think is eminem
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaReal movie go-ers will know that the end scene in the trailer with the knifes will be at the end of the movie xd
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing me most of a movie I wouldn&#39;t go watch anyway. 5/10 Not bad, not good
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaberzerk :)
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaBack again DAWG!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThese movies just get more and more retarded
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI think I had a heart attack, couldn&#39;t handle the awesome.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaYES!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson isn&#39;t really a villain filmography wise...why didn&#39;t they get Alan Rickman to make up for the lack of Willis.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWords cannot describe how excited I am for this to come out!!! 😳😃😃
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaHell yeah
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaLove love... who is tht girl..she looks hott
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitakinda looks worse when compared to the previous two movies but, totally looking forward to seeing some rhonda rousey action ;)
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWell it kinda spoiled the movie so yeah
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshita@Psych Bruce Wills surelly
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to it 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI could watch this forever
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaSpolier alert the title is expendables 3 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaОни вернулись)
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitathis looks like fun
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaDid Snipes just avoid prison?, unrealistic...
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI hope they encounter more resistance this time. It was way too easy for them in the two other movies and I didn&#39;t really worry if any of them was gonna die or not. 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaDillon! You Son of a bitch!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaOh oh oh thats awesome :)
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI wish they would get a bunch of badass villians to go up against all these &quot;heroes&quot;. I mean, I love seeing all these guys together, but there is some huge wasted potential here.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWait, &quot;one last ride&quot; is that this is the last expendables movie? nooooooooo
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaDespite how stupid it was, expendables 2 is one of my favorite action movies. I&#39;m not really sure it needed a sequel.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThat was the whole movie
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaGENIAL &lt;3 I can&#39;t wait
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitawhat happened to Jackie Chan&#39;s rumour?
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaI thought they took it to far with a 2nd and now i hear they are planning on a 4th before the 3rd has even released XD 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThe Expendables watch elderly awesome people kicks ass, Now with even more elderly people can&#39;t wait to see it!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaawesome, making historyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitamakes me horny .. and that comes not from dat girl  :D
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWhere is CHUCK NORRIS !!!!!!!!! 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaman it would of been much more better if Sly Stallone hired kurt russel and they drove in with that truck from  tango and cash. man that was a sweet ass movie
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaSo mel gibson will be the main villain ? 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaIs that Eminem singing? What song
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaCan somebody tell me who from the 1 and 2 one aren&#39;t in this movie? 
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaEminem
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaThe Expendables breaking Wesley Snipes out of prison. Now that&#39;s pretty funny...
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaso many legends. its too bad we can&#39;t get them together in a good movie.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaSHOOT AND BLOW EVERYTHING UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWould love to see Benicio Del Toro as the villain.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to.....
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitajizz in my pants, no homo
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaALTERNATE TITLE: &quot;Every Hollywood Actor Over 50 Blows Shit Up.&quot;
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaBerserk!!! &lt;3
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitathis sequal shouldve ended already...
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaNo Nicholas Cage. 0/10 worst movie ever........﻿
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaNot really a fan of the Expendables since they always lack interesting action, but this looks pretty good from the little snippets in the video. They said they are doing similar stuff like The Raid..lets see if they can nail that.
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaaction awesome,acting not so much
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaWant to see this movie so bad
4xD0junWlFcdelimeterByIshitaholy shit
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMoney
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible. New and fresh style mixed with a legendary history. Great rebirth.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThe one thing I can&#39;t help but think....all these movies where the protagonist is a black person....they all start out in the ghettos or in a &quot;rough&quot; neighborhood.....would there still be a movie if people actually came together to clean up their acts and neighborhoods? hmmm
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI was an extra in this movie! 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t an extra in this movie m I had to go to Aston pa. It was really cool. 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaOh FUCK yeah!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaVery epic.<br><br>Most chilling line&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know him [Apollo]. All that ain&#39;t got nothing to do with me.&quot;<br><br>To many, it was a plot device when Apollo died. To this guy it changed his entire life.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMBJordan is going to be Huge Star! 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMovie looks good, awesome song by one of the best rappers Lupe Fiasco! 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaGet them Oscars prepped. This looks amazing.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSTOKED!!!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaDamn they got the B-more Bikers in this too
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaGot chills watching this
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSo Warner Bros it confident in this movie to release it in November for award season if it were terrible they would have released in february where it could have still made decent money no matter the quality
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaWhen the trailer started I was hesitant, but towards the end I began to love it.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSo hyped.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaHow can this have any dislikes
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshita2015 - &quot;Bleed for This&quot; - Miles Teller plays a boxer<br><br>2015 - &quot;Creed&quot; - Michael B. Jordan plays a boxer<br><br>2015 - &quot;Fantastic 4&quot; with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan<br><br>2014 - &quot;That Awkward Moment&quot; with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan<br>
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaNow the just need a Rocky movie where Adrianne comes back as a guardian angel...or they could make her a ghost and go in the horror direction.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMusic is a remix of Fort Minor&#39;s Believe Me
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaanyone else recognize the music at the end from an old garageband loop?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SO HYPED
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaLooks great.  I love how they don&#39;t reveal who the movie is <b>really</b> about, until just a little over half-way through the trailer (though you get a brief glimpse of Mighty Mick&#39;s gym, and mild reference to Apollo&#39;s death in the ring), when they finally unveil the old-school connection.  This movie&#39;s called &quot;Creed&quot; for a reason.  Looking forward to it!  MBJ beefed up!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song around the middle of the trailer?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaLooks good
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv554B7YHk4&amp;t=1m48s">1:48</a> GABE ROSADO... man i bet the last guy he fights is DANNY GARCIA.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing, but those garage band loops though! Come on guys!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaOk so Avon moved to Philly after he got out of jail?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaA trailer that doesn&#39;t show everything in the movie...WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI dig this 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Wallace!?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED !!!!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThat moment when you realize this is a rocky movie.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSo pumped for this movie
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaInteresting! Tell me more! why is everyone talking about Rocky? Is it jsut because Sylvester Stallone is in this move?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaOscars called. Stallone about to get another one.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI love how Stallone&#39;s legacy has come full circle!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaNever thought i&#39;d be pumped to see a rocky movie.....damn
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHH YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>FUCK THE HATERS - ANY ROCKY MOVIE IS FUCKING EPIC !!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThis is going to be good!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23philly">#philly</a>
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI Can&#39;t Wait 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaOh shit, Avon Barksdale and Wallace!!!! I guess this is where the fuck Wallace went!!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait<br>
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThe cinematography, the acting, and the color pallets looks clean. I&#39;m excited for Michael B. Jordan&#39;s performance. The man has talent. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FlameOn">#FlameOn</a>
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI love it how they&#39;re honoring the Rocky lore, but also appear to be making a solid stand alone movie at the same time. 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaDOPE!!!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshita&quot;Life isn&#39;t about how hard you can hit. It&#39;s about how hard you get hit and keep moving forward&quot; That&#39;s honestly the quote I live by 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaChills, baby. Can&#39;t wait for this. 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaBetter have some actual boxing and not some corny ass fight scenes. We saw all the corny stuff in the rocky movies. 
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe they put Lupe Fiasco song on here from his last album Tetsuo &amp; Youth! FUCKING AWESOME!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMJ Can act excited to see him in Fantastic 4
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitab jordan is a great actor, should have been cyborg instead of the human torch
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaThis looks very different from the Rocky films in terms of tone, a lot grittier. I like it a lot!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaDefinitely watching this.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaHell yeah dude. This looks bad ass. And a great, perhaps only way, to tell the next chapter of the &quot;Rocky Universe&quot;.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaPqp que foda.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the song used in this trailer?
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI love Michael B. Jordan, but you should have casted Xavier Woods.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe this trailer showed 52nd Street! All kinds of awesome!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CREED">#CREED</a>

Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitathe movie looks great, but how would Michael B Jordons character know that &quot;how hard you can get hit&quot; line, rocky said that to his son outside a restaurant and nobody else was there!
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitalooks like shit

Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaMicheal B. Jordan is such a great actor. The trailer looks awesome! Finally a movie with some content instead of overhyped action movies.
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSong: Prisoner 1 &amp; 2 - Lupe Fiasco
Uv554B7YHk4delimeterByIshitaSong: Lupe Fiasco – Prisoner 1 &amp; 2 (feat. Ayesha Jaco)

yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaKino

yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaRedditors get it first

yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaNigga what the fuck?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaBy far one of the most different and interesting trailers I&#39;ve seen. But I&#39;ve never been so excited or intrigued for a movie to come out!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI like eggs.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI like eggs
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitathis is craziest trailer I have seen... holy mother of god!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaevery day he looks just a little bit more like Elijah wood
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaWTF! looks hilariously awesome
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaRadcliffe will never replace our army knives!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaoh i get it daniel radcliff is body is a tool that can do anything it wants.... right?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaWow. I can not wait to watch this. Looks brilliant!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaIt just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There&#39;s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitathis looks cool.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI assume radcliff is dead and the other has gone mad?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand what this is. But I want to see more of it.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been touched in places that I never knew existed.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaКТО ОТ ЧБ? МЫ ОТ ЧБ!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaYeah, just spoil everything, fucking idiots.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaThis shit looks hilarious!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m confused
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaWhat I just seen?!?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m like wtf! lol have to watch it
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking awful.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaso Emma Watson will be playing Belle in Beauty and the Beast and Daniel is playing...... a farting corpse. Welp, if he wanted to shake his Harry Potter persona....he uh...definitely succeeded.  Hmmmm... it looks terribly brilliant.  I&#39;ll give it a chance.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaThis is 3 days late...
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI want see this now, please.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaIncredible! Absolutely incredible.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitawhat
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitathis is the community&#39;s fault, we asked for more original movies, this is what happens people!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitalooks too weird.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaFunction number 48: natural fleshlight.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaDaniels! Nooo, there goes the series! Daniels had a second left and he didn&#39;t even throw it in? That&#39;s so sad for my team and me!
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI am so confused right now. A wizard who is dead but who is apparently not quite dead and farts alot. 10 points for Gryffindor.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaImagine pitching this movie as someone with no resume of success in the industry. Super challenge: do it with dreadlocks and flip flops
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck did i just watch
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Swiss&quot; and the opening shot is on an islanf bravo
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaТрэшачина
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaCast Away and Weekend at Bernie&#39;s had a baby
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI was like. WTF, But now I am going to watch it.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaSo I saw this movie at Sundance, and I can tell you that the entire soundtrack is a capella tracks composed by Manchester Orchestra and recorded on set by Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaOne of the weirdest fucking trailer I ever watched but looks fucking surreal and brilliantly filmed.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitalooks i forgot to take my medicine
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshita???
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshita3 days to late guys.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitawhen harry found dumbledore&#39;s lsd
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaLooks refreshing and adventurous
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitanew hope for the film industry
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitawah?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaHipster nonsense
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23OMG">#OMG</a> I do need to watch this movie, the trailer is awesome, I think Daniel Radcliffe&#39;s performance will be absolutely excellent as always. I&#39;m very interesed on this film, moreover <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Ej%C3%A9rcitoRadcliffe">#EjércitoRadcliffe</a> can&#39;t wait to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SwissArmyMan">#SwissArmyMan</a>
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaAll right. I&#39;m sixty... and I&#39;m pretty sure I just saw the weirdest trailer I&#39;ve ever seen. Possibly, the weirdest trailer that&#39;s ever been...been... been trailed.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaFrom the makers of the Turn Down For What video...comes a magical journey.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaLooks odd but I definitely wanna see it
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea how to feel about this.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaSundance movie not even trying to use something else than The Lumineers-ish pop-folk shitty music. I guess the poster will be yellow.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitathis has daniels written all over it no surprise there at the end:P
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaWhat the actual fuck?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaPaul Dano using Daniel Radcliffe as a jet ski and a machine gun.... WHERE DO I SIGN???
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Radcliff in his most magical role!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wingardium Leviosaaaa....

yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitawhat does that supposed to be?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitamusic?pls
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaThis is the type of movies people hate, and I love
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaHey grampa, where&#39;d you get that sled?
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaA farting corpse film has ended up in my most anticipated films of the year. This is literally be a breathe of fresh air.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitacant wait
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI am the first person to say First Comment,<br>but the third person to Comment here.<br>BTW this is weirdly awesome.
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaRelease it in India
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaWeird but awesome
yrK1f4TsQfMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what I just watched... But I like it.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaOscar.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSteven Spielberg + Tom Hank + 2015= Bridge of CGI(all looks so fake)
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaBig fan of tom hanks! Icant wait to see this!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshita...what the <i>hell</i> did I just watch?? I was <b>really</b> looking forward to this trailer. Steven Spielberg is a very important filmmaker in my life. But this...this &quot;America, f--k yeah/virginal american child crying during a newsreel of an atomic blast...I think I may throw up. I mean, sometimes the trailers <i>REALLY</i> get it wrong...but I have to say I&#39;m fairly crushed at just how bad this one really <b>was.</b>
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSpielberg is my favourite director of all time, I&#39;m going to be excited for any film he directs
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks movies are always worth watching, and it looks pretty good.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro&amp;t=0m16s">0:16</a> that bastard Todd lives again
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWhat a soundtrack, dreamworks...what a soundtrack. And I hope the trailer didn&#39;t show us a lot.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaBecause of Schedules...Since JJ Abrams and Kathy Kennedy are giving John Williams 3 plus Months to write the score and re score to the new Star Wars Film...This gave him zero time to write a score for Steven Spielberg film. The 2nd time. Color Purple being the first time. Thomas Newman...Who John Williams recommended to Spielberg to write this score to Bridge of Spies.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the first movie that has captured my interest for awhile
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitayeah amazing
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWas that alan alda in one of the scenes?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI want to see this just because part of it is filmed in my small town, where Beale Air Force is!! lol. I&#39;ve been to that base a million times and it was the talk of the town when Tom Hanks &amp; Steven Spielberg was here...in nowheresville USA. LOL 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaA Steven Spielberg Film = I&#39;m sold
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this! Tom Hanks is so amazing, I wonder how he produced such a terrible kid who thinks hes a gangster.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaIs this a sequel to Forrest Gump?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaso, another crap movie where USA is the good guy and RUSSIA the bad one = stupid<br><br>-1
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaDang! Tommy got oooold.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWaaait...<br>Music by Thomas Newman on a Steven Spielberg film??<br>Where is John Williams??
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaHey look Tom Hanks isn&#39;t dead!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaOscar Bait
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a le Carre story
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro&amp;t=0m16s">0:16</a> beefy blond guy, what&#39;s his name or what else has he played in?! can&#39;t remember and it&#39;s killing me T_T
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaA Cold War Movie starring Tom Hanks. As soon as I read Spielberg, I stopped watching the trailer with an absolute certitude that this is gonna be a great film !! 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaHope it&#39;s not to much &#39;murica, tho I doubt Spielberg would be so unimaginative, when was we last had a good war movie which was not another digital national parade? IDK maybe Stanley Kubrick&#39;s work ?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaLooks good. I admire the way he frames shots so much.  Does not seem as milky looking as his other movies of late. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaBased on a lot of the comments below, I guess it&#39;s considered morally wrong and low-brow for a movie to contain patriotism.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaباعرف شكللكم 🐸
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitamy fathers car is in this movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> 1951 mercury can&#39;t wait for this movie
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks always deliver
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI think we will see the rise of Ultra-nationalism and propaganda on both sides of Cold War. This isnt going to be  USvsUSSR type movie. This is going to be movie that shows how bad both sides really are, and man stuck in between
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaOmg! I think Spielberg has directed his next &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; everybody. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaHmmm...Could be good and hopefully not as hammy as &quot;War Horse&quot; was. It has that &quot;Give me the Oscar right now!&quot; vibe written all over it.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBuzHrZBro&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> looks like a recreation of the final scene of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold...
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good! I&#39;m glad Spielberg is back!  
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSPOILER ALERT the US and USSR dont go to war
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks, The Cohen Brothers, and Steven Spielberg? That alone piques my interest.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaGlad to see Spielberg back after having not releasing any movies since 2012 with Lincoln 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaBlah blah blah ..... had it on mute. Lol
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitawhen there is a movie joins tom and stevien in one movie .. you should know is an epic one
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThe Americans: Prequel movie
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaCan we take a minute and think about the tagline &quot;inspired by true events&quot;. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I get inspired by a true story, but true events? As opposed to what, pretend events? That makes no sense. It should say &quot;real events&quot; or &quot;a true story&quot;. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThe maestro is back!!!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks + Spielberg + Coen Brothers = EPICNESS
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaj adore de l action
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom is such a good actor I feel bad his son acts like a douche
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSo this is a war era movie based on true events with a cast of people popular in the film community, looks like Oscar bait to me.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaaside from the hair tom hanks doesn&#39;t look a day older than back in saving private ryan.  Some one ring magic going on.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThe Color Purple didn&#39;t have a John Williams score. You&#39;re welcome.  It&#39;s the first time. Do research. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWhy not name Steven Spielberg in the title? Would garner more views.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaGuys this is a STEVEN SPIELBERG film. It&#39;ll be great. I think he knows what he&#39;s doing. Don&#39;t bash a Spielberg movie. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaLooks like The Conspirator.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaNever been more excited for a Spielberg film in ages - and I love them all. <br><br>Do you think Michael Bay weeps when he sees a trailer like this, that is actually, really exciting? <br>
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI think Tom Hanks accepts the job.<br><br>But will have to wait to see the movie, the trailer wasn&#39;t specific.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaAre the comments in this video defending Russia?   It&#39;s almost as bad as defending Germany, or Vietnam. I said almost. We were at war with Russia, and they did some pretty terrible things, and they&#39;re doing some of the same stuff still...today. Yes, we did some pretty terrible things too, but what happened to when we were proud to be Americans?  <br><br>By the by....what was wrong with American sniper?  Honoring a man who helped this country from evil is a bad thing?  It&#39;s racist because he killed people who wanted to kill us?  I don&#39;t understand. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWilsoooooon!!!!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWe need mason woods and Hudson for this mission
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI wonder if Chez has a cameo and blows the whole deal?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom hanks <br>He can act in any film and it will be amazing 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshita...<br>So this will get Oscars.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThis reminds of To Kill a mockingbird a bit 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaOscars?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaMark Rylance is going to get nominated for his part in the film. He is this generations Olivier!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaYou know what kills this genre,,,yeah propaganda,,,,now tell me the difference between glorified nazi movies and murican sniper the prequel
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThis has Oscar written all over it!!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThis movie REEKS of awards.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaCan hanks pick a bad movie for once? Sheesh lol
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t win me over this trailer. And the CG does not look well
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaold trend- bad Russians
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s kind of a to kill a mockingbird theme in there
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTo be honest just because spielberg directed it,is the only reason i&#39;m going to see it.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t want to say damn....BUT DAMN!!!!!!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaIn my left ear &quot;this is looking like the next American Sniper&quot;<br><br>In my right ear &quot;Steven Spielberg, Coen Brothers and Tom Hanks. Recipe for awesome!&quot;
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t look good ...
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaso much thrilling!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaA REAL STEVEN SPIELBERG FILM HAS JOHN WILLIAMS&#39; MUSIC :(
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaPipocando
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSign me up!
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks is everything.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSpielberg still is and always will be the greatest !
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThe more things change the more they stay the same<br>The Americans just aren&#39;t the same unless they have someone to be afraid of<br>Then it was the communists and now it&#39;s terrorists <br>
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this movie when it comes out in theaters. Will this movie be available to watch in at least one theater in Dubai? Is it to early to ask?
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSomething tells me the next mistake their countries made wasn&#39;t the last one.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSo fuckin hyped. Been waiting forever for a trailer. Finally a new Spielberg directed movie. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaAlready you have a bunch of losers making propaganda accusations for a movie they didn&#39;t even watch or a historical event they probably know nothing about. Typical. 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSpielberg and Hanks instantly triggers my interest, but this looks a bit &#39;murrica for my taste.. As the innocent child cries as she watches a soviet nuke blow up. Really? Well, let&#39;s hope this film isn&#39;t patronizing soviet in any way. We don&#39;t need another American Sniper..
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaThat was a lot of info in one trailer.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSpielberg and hanx is this a dream!!!! 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaWAITED SOOOOO LONG FOR THIS!!! 🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitabla bla bla another AMERICAN movie made to impress the world...
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI know tom hanks is just doing this movie to get nominated but damn it looks good
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitax-men first class
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaSteven Spielberg + Tom Hanks = Legendary
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaIts really Tom Henks? OMFG IM SO OLD...................
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a contender for Best Picture in Oscars  Go Tom Hanks your the best looking forward for a nomination for the best actor
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaConsidering this film has both Spielberg and Hanks, it looks overwhelmingly cliche
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitafirst
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaTom hanks is a legend.
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitaI almost fell asleep watching this trailer. Boring boring 
mBBuzHrZBrodelimeterByIshitathis looks good
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaAll these comments are B.S. this movie sucks so much I want my money back
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaWhat I hate about this movie is that it&#39;s ruined all comedy movies for me forever. It has raised the bar so high that I don&#39;t believe I will ever laugh as hard as I did watching this. Funniest movie of all time. 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie in theatres yesterday, and it was hilarious! 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaAnd amazing that Stu steals the show
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaJust watched it in Chicago. &quot;Hilarious&quot; start to finish. Really funny, so many great characters.
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitajus finished this movie, it was funny, love it! recommended lol
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaIt must &quot;suck&quot; living forever in an exclusively male-inhabited world.
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitait was ok. the concept was funnier than the actual movie. i really liked the part when they met the werewolves. 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaI hope this gets a wider release, it looks great.
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitai loved this film - can anyone suggest more films as good as this one?
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshita&quot;It&#39;s their last moment alive so why not make it a nice experience&quot; I laughed so hard during this movie! 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaJermaine makes me laugh all the time&#39;
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME COMEDY!!!! BEST IN LAST 15 YEARS!!!!<br>Liked how Stu survive and became werewolf not a swearwolf......They definitely have to make a sequel!!!<br>10/10 :)
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaWhat a great movie! I strongly recommend it. It&#39;s way better than most of the high-budget-hollywood-crap out there.   
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaThe funniest movie i ever seen!  :D go watch it!
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaWe want more series ! We want more series ! We want more series ! We want more series ! We want more series !!! Please

IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaHow is this a horror?
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitahilarious movie!XD
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was surprisingly good... style reminds me of The Office. Really good... will watch it more in future... this should be actually series, I feel.
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was just great, so many incredibly hilarious moments to laugh about even after the movie has ended.  Such an original idea and brilliantly executed.  If you haven&#39;t seen it, definitely give it a go!
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitathe most funniest movie in years!!!!!
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious!
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitai just being honest i dont like this movie, and mean no harm to others thanks.  
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaFunniest movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time, so damn good
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshita&quot;i&#39;m supposed to pay the rent...but i don&#39;t :)) &quot; 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaHaha brill film 
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t seen such a funny flick in years! The only thing that bothers me is that I can&#39;t find the song they practised before going out. Brilliant soundtrack!  I hope someone helps. Thank you in advance
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of Spinal Tap but it&#39;s based on Vampires instead of rock stars. It&#39;s funny.

IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaI clicked on this video expecting to see a very poorly made attempt of a film, only because I had just watched 3 other trailers (of separate movies) that were.

IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaSo, just having seen the video about &quot;Vampire&#39;s guide to Vellington&quot;, I wondered, maybe they&#39;re meant to be called Wampires, given that they always say W&#39;s as V&#39;s.
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaSaw this last night at Melbourne International Film Festival, the whole cinema was laughing from start to end. Highly recommend this!
IAZEWtyhpesdelimeterByIshitaI really recommend this film, it was so good!

u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaMy absolute favorite Wolverine movie Mostly because i love Japanese culture and two because i had something to do with the movie promotion<br><br>I was contacted by BET video show 106 and PARK to create a group of rouge X MEN hip hop characters who consisted of KANYE WEST SERERRA PUFFY and LIL WANYE who would be used as a talking point for HUGH JACKMAN  on his guess spot of the show.<br>Each villian was endowed with a special.power that was indicative of their hip hop persona.  and Jackmans job was to tell how Wolverine would deal with each threat.<br>I had less than  24 hours to create those drawings and its the best work id ever done and led to MTV using me for a commercial spot drawing JUSTIN BEIBER JAY Z and other hip jop cjaracters

u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaI was excited to see this movie but after watching...it was major disappointment. A really stupid movie...the story line made no sense and the acting was just so ridiculously poor 
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaYou really would want to live forever? Wolverine was too strong. 
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaNo kidding

u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaMarvel needs to make a dead pool movie, show the movie studios what a real badass does
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re not making him mortal dumbasses, it&#39;s just that his healing factor will not work as well as before. Why? Well let&#39;s just say that he didn&#39;t choose to have it that way...
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaI can never forgive Hugh Jackman for the misery of Les Miserables. 
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaAfter two centuries of being used as a mindless killing machine by some, a pawn by others, and watching everyone you know and love die, usually by your hand, yeah, you&#39;d want to be mortal. You&#39;d eventually run out of things to live for.
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaMaybe it&#39;ll be like Superman 2 where he loses his powers and chooses to get them back.
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaNo one can really judge this movie, for all we know its edited like this so its preserving its good moments
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaSo now he can get AIDS.
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaThis looks soooo bad..... Like laughably bad
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaI guess the writers of this movie forgot to cover that if Wolverine loses his power to heal, he also loses his power to have claws that come from his BONES.
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaasian lady looks like the mortal kombat asian dude from the 1st movie : / n looks like a insect
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaUm.....no.
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this the basic plot to Superman II?
u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaTo add some cheap dramma.

u1VCP3O8wG0delimeterByIshitaWhy are they making him mortal? That&#39;s a bummer!

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaI really wanted Keira to be one of the climbers because her cheekbones would have been so great in the cold.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaFor all who r watching this trailer, Everest lies in NEPAL I m from Nepal!! 
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaBy all means, just show the whole movie in the trailer. :/
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitai am very proud of having Mt.Everest in my country.... i am waiting for this movie in NEPAL.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaHow did they get up there without the Sherpas ? Didn&#39;t see any on the trailer ?
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaStill Optimistic!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaI read Into Thin Air back in the day. I hope this is excellent. 
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitasucks that they dont just make teasers. Trailers shows too much
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaa thought came to me about 6 months that there should be a film about climbing mountain everest. now there is
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitawhat a cast! WOW
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! Just finished reading After the Wind - by one of the survivors, Lou Kasischke. He gave a different perspective from Krakauer&#39;s Into Thin Air...will be interesting to see how the movie compares.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaЕбланы, опять показали весь фильм в трейлере.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaIt looks great! I can&#39;t wait to see it.

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think Frank Underwood will be too happy when he finds out Claire is with Doug.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be an epic movie, can&#39;t wait!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaCool. But get rid of the fucking Inception horns. NOW.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaIf the Avengers were in this situation, would they survive?
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaLooks like Sylvester Stallone and John Lithgow will be in their next trailer.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaNice trailer!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaEVEREST MOVIE - SKYPE MOVIE[UNFRIENDED] - WHAT&#39;S NEXT
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaSPOILER ALERT INCOMING TO THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE THIS FILM!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Most likely the 8 characters are all going to die because the event it is based on shows that all 8 hikers die.

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaPlease let &quot;Imagine Dragons -  On Top Of The World&quot; be the soundtrack..
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaKeira Knightley&#39;s accent sounds less than accurate.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaNeeds more Gyllenhaal
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaholy shit.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitahmmm looks suspiciously fake with no nitroglycerin canisters in sight
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaanyone else thought of family guy?

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaJust listened to the audiobook version of this narrated by a climber, forgot his name... awesome that its coming to the big screen
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaLooks intense.  Good cast too. 
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshita&quot;Human Bodies aren&#39;t meant to function at the altitude of a 747&quot; UM Ever heard of Red Bull. You grow wings and shiz
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaTrailer shows not a single Sherpa. Without them, affluent westerners could not climb Everest. It really should be shown as a team effort.<br><br><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130501-mount-everest-fight-sherpas-sahibs-world-mountain-climbing/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130501-mount-everest-fight-sherpas-sahibs-world-mountain-climbing/</a><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster</a>

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaLots of movies coming out on September 18...
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaFor climbers, this is a harrowing experience. For the sherpas that escort them it&#39;s Tuesday.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaGyllenhaal with only cameo?
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaNew movie again. Hmmm
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaHow had I not heard about this before? Definitely on the watchlist now :)
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaПонравился!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaLarger than life!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshita...this trailer seems to follow faithfully Jon Krakeur’s best-selling book Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster ...
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitakathmandu
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaReally, why are there always American dickhead superheroes in every movie. (thumps down)
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaMan, is the music at the end an actual song? Sounds real epic, would love to know what the song&#39;s called. AND I LOVE the trailer, can&#39;t wait to see this in the cinemas!
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitamy watchlist
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be awesome.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it. Why can&#39;t they just fly up in a helicopter?
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitathanks for the  awesome movie
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaBrasil pohaa
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaJason Clarke is always giving long ass speeches in trailers
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaThat cast is dope. I&#39;ll watch.
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaFunny how the trailer reminds me so much of Gravity. The power of editing...
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZQVpPiOji0&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a>

5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaIo ho avuto anche la fortuna di vedere una parte del set di Roma 
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be high when i watch this
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitayou could say this film is high up on my watchlist
5ZQVpPiOji0delimeterByIshitaFirst!!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TEKITOcreations by that logic this is an ET ripoff
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TEKITOcreations by that logic this is an ET ripoff
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@hyacinthdibley see, this is the ignorance that is okay, you think that these things coming togetehr are a good thing

so I am not goign to bother to correct you :D
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@hyacinthdibley That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. People are claiming it&#39;s like avatar because it has a human fighting aliens, but story is completely different. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TEKITOcreations lol. Every movie that has humans and aliens kinda look the same. It&#39;s the story line that has to make each stand out.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaThis is like &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; meets &quot;StarWars&quot; meets &quot;Avatar&quot; kinda meets &quot;StarGate&quot;.
The graphics looks amazing. It keeps getting better.
He is Ugly, but he is Beautiful. lol
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@MaatDaaamon How? What similarities does this have with Avatar? Just because it has a human surrounded by CGI aliens doesn&#39;t mean it copied Avatar. The stories are nothing alike. Plus this is based on a book that game out 100 years before Avatar.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait...
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitai always imagined the aliens (green ones) as huge muscular and scary not skinny and regular sized
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Aprinsa Glad to see you&#39;re not immature about his.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@AndyRantz Mind explaining how this movie is anything like the movies you mentioned? This movie has no environmental message.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaUgh I can&#39;t believe they used that song!!! &gt;:(
other than that, great!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@AndyRantz except it is none of those things at all!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@kmccarney88 Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote that scene in 1912 in the book this movie is based off!

that scene is taken right out of the book!


nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a STUPID TITLE!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@AndyRantz The problem with that is is that John Carter came out in 1912 wich would mean that all of those movies you just mentioned were rip offs of John Carter.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitawow, it&#39;s all Movie Cliches put into one movie! 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaThat Arena scene couldn&#39;t possibly be any more of a rip-off of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones if you tried. It&#39;s the EXACT same! An arena made from natural formation of brown/clay-colored rock on a totally desert-like planet with hundreds of thousands of brown &amp; green aliens cheering on the massacre by an oversized, white-colored, harry alien creature....with the main character forced to resort to primitive but extreme escape methods. Jesus Christ, they could have at least TRIED to hide it. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaHey look, it&#39;s Avatar!! And Pocahontas!! And Dances With Wolves!! And Ferngully!! And Dune!!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaAre you kidding me? On my birthday, this very stupid movie will premiere? Thanks for nothing, Hollywood! I never get any birthday presents.

The lines are cheesy as could be, and the acting looks cringe-worthy. I could easily find acting a thousands time better at a local stage theatre where the actors probably make diddly squat... I hope this film is a box office flop!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaAvatar wasn&#39;t original in the first place, so if you&#39;re going to compare, leave Avatar off that list!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Cha4k This movie is nothing like those movies, aside from having aliens. This is based on a book that came out long before star wars.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@RonJammin Nothing&#39;s wrong with using a lot of CGI as long as it&#39;s necessary. When a movie takes place on mars with with lots of hi-tech and 12 foot tall aliens with green skin and four arms, and think CGI is a given. And how is it similar to Avatar. The stories are nothing alike.  Also, what&#39;s wrong with using an already made song for the trailer. Movies do that all the time. As long it&#39;s used well in the trailer, it&#39;s fine. Now you&#39;re reaching for see something negative,.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@vain911 John Carter predates both hulk and avatar
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@dougmoerhoffman actually no. the aliens were described perfectly well in the 1912 novel. So if anything, it&#39;s the other way round.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Ralokone I was going to say planey hulk with alittle avatar.Anyway,disney owns marvel so
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Honeygmod Planet Hulk was highly influenced by ERB&#39;s mars
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@LordJess1987 Okay . . . you need help, they didnt rip off the song they just used it bro!

They acquired the license for the song, and played it during the trailer!

that is not ripping it off
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita&quot;Oh Shangri-La beneath a summer moon....&quot;
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@anispor Mummy and lord of the rings . . . . . do either of those have any of the science fiction concepts being portrayed in this?

and those were good movies
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaoh sweet Tarzan goes to mars on vacation .
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaThe Mummy meets Lord of the Rings. Another loud headache pretending to be a film.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a decent mix of Avatar and Star Wars.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TheBrewchief Yeah, I quickly corrected myself. Unfortunately, the correction is buried in a sea of past comments. I need to slow down when typing. Thanks, man.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in it for the girl.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaHere we go with knee-jerk YouTube comments again. They&#39;re alien and a different color in the desert. Cue up every movie you ever saw that did one of those and decry  how unoriginal it is. &#39;Cause, you know, now that we have Avatar, we can&#39;t have a movie about aliens ever again.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@MonkersX none, it is john carter, it is before avatar, before carter, and before the 300 comic (horribly innacurate to real life events)
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@dougmoerhoffman seriously people . . .. star wars had an arena so they now own arenas


are you guys stupid

what about the movie gladiator?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaKashmir&#39;d
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@RonJammin I dont think a story written eighty years before avatar wars conceived can rip off avatar!


nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@dougmoerhoffman So  Edgar Rice Burroughs guessed in 1912 what George Lucas would do in 2002?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaAttack of the clones 2.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaCall me crazy.. but I think some CGI effects were used in this. Seems like the story is ripping off Avatar a bit (which also ripped off other storylines). And what&#39;s with the Kashmir song, can&#39;t they come up with original recordings anymore? Pass.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TheKSProduction when I started reading your comment, I automatically switched to singing it to the of that Kashmir rendition
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaBut where is Nemo?!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@TheGame2493 dear god i love you. you simply enjoy the movie for what it is. you didn&#39;t say anything negative. you didn&#39;t even compare this to another movie. we need more comments like this man. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaLooks a fun Sci-Fi-Fantasy-Movie.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaWow. An upcoming movie I can actually be excited about.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaFODA FODA FODA!!!! PIRANDO LOUCAMENTE!!! NÃO ESPERAVA ISSO TUDO DESSE FILME!!!! *O*
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitadisney, do us all a favor and put an annotation on the video (you know the kind, the kind that can be turned off) saying

&quot;Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; first published in 1912&quot;

Just put that right at the top of the video, because people apparently need to be told that this has nothing to do with avatar other than avatar having some influence from it!

right at the top, in that black space so it doesnt interfere with the video
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@stdTrancR in case you cannot tell, that blue is the blood of his enemies!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaLooks kinda poo. Like a sort of Green Lantern quality mix of Attack of the Clones and Prince of Persia. I should say &quot;I could be wrong&quot; but everytime I say that I&#39;m right. So yea I&#39;m pretty sure this is going to suck.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaNice. Looks like we&#39;ll have a new Star Wars&#39; sci-fi style. It&#39;s gonna be great!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaWhat? Zeppelin in the background? Figuring it&#39;s Disney, you figure they&#39;d spring some more &quot;chesse&quot; for original music.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@sshuisken - totally agree with u mate,comparing is pointless,u either watch it if u like the trailer or dont,rather than comparing n wasting time 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m blue da ba dee
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaRead the book, loved it, i am very curious about this movie. Nice to see they did it.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaHoly shiiiiiiiiiiit that was epic! and Kashmir from Led Zeppelin in the background? MORE EPICNESS
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaGee...what great acting....
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitawell thats cool,it doesnt give me &quot;must watch&quot; vibe,but neither did avatar and in the end it turned out to be great,this looks good as well. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaAvatar?  Seriously.  John Carter- Warlord of Mars is nearly a century older than Avatar...This is old pulp tales by Edgar Rice Burroughs from the early 1910&#39;s.  If anyone ripped anything off of anyone it was Avatar (which once you get past the visuals, was complete crap).
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this, trailer sure looks epic, very beautiful scenes indeed
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaAvatar sucked dick, complete shit of a movie!! 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaThe setup reminds me of Prince Of Persia.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@lordioris This novel is over 100 years old.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI honestly don&#39;t see the similarities between this and Avatar. Avatar was about a group of people traveling to another planet to dig up a rare mineral, one of the solders disguise themselves as one of the aliens and he ends up falling in love with the world fights against the humans. This movie is about a civil war vet. being taken to a war torn mars to help a group of aliens fight another group of aliens. Am I missing something?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Ralokone yes but i also saw a green leader calling him beautiful. whats your point?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@owlking I read this, then moved on with my life. 20 minutes later, I laughed at how childish this statement was. Well done. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI only have only thing to say: This is going to be an awesome level in Kingdom Hearts 3!
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@MatthewMcPheeZ Puff Daddy borrowed the beat from Led Zeppelin&#39;s song Kashmir.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about time.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about time.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaGreat work everyone, looks awesome. :)
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaI AM EXCITED FOR THIS.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@J91122 It&#39;s not a documentary dude.........
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@Ralokone +1. still, Bobwanable managed to top this...
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitawow really amazing work from VFX studio&#39;s who worked this project  
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaIs John Carter a James Cameron&#39;s Avatar Prequel ?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@xASYxLUMx my god, the first comment here is stupid beyond measure D:
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@nikehike did you not see him being chained up in a green martian arena at the beginning?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@tmxadvertising it&#39;s an orchestral version of &quot;Kashmir&quot; from Led Zeppelin. P. Diddy made a hip-hop remix called &quot;come with me&quot; for the American Godzilla movie. But Led Zep rulz over all ;-)
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaFYI James Cameron ripped off EVERYTHING from the first book in the John Carter series and mixed it with Dances with Wolves and called it Avatar. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@handsomerobots thanks for the heads up. so basically some green guys are good and some are bad.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaprince of perisa goes to Mars.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@nikehike In the books there are different warring tribes of the green martians.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@J91122 it&#39;s based on a series of fictional books written nearly a century ago. Real Martian conditions aren&#39;t really relevant.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitawhy is he killing the green guys at the end? i thought he was friends with them.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@sshuisken Please, for the love of GOD ignore the major grammar mistake I made. I typed &quot;irreverent&quot; when I meant to type &quot;irrelevant.&quot;
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@J91122 Been to Mars personally, have you? Keep in mind, this is a time when the planet had a breathable atmosphere and actual oceans. So the sky can look different as a result.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaProblem 1. Daytime on Mars is a pink-ish red sky. The sun setting on Mars makes the sky appear blue until the sun is no longer visible. 

Problem 2. Daytime high temperatures on Mars can exceed 100 C. Nightime lows can go down to -110 C. 

Imagining this movie is on Mars is like playing Mass Effect without space. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaCool but I like Jake Sully not John Carter -.-
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ people. Avatar was Avatar. John Carter is John Carter. Whether or not they are similar or different is irreverent. I enjoyed Avatar and I&#39;m a huge fan of the Barsoom novels - because you CAN like both. Start enjoying a film for what it is rather than comparing it with others. If all we did was compare, every movie made since Citizen Kane would be garbage - arguably. This looks like an immensely fun film. Kudos to Pixar.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaEhh.. whats the plot?
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like an amazing movie.  I know where I&#39;ll be on March 9th.  With Andrew Stanton directing, it looks like it&#39;ll be a blast, even if the plot somehow doesn&#39;t live up to what we&#39;ve seen in these previews. 
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitai can wait to see
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, I&#39;m liking this version of Kashmir.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@xASYxLUMx Your point being? Considering Avatar copied the hell out of Burroughs&#39; novels. This looks amazing.
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitaKinda liking the looks of this!

nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshitagraphics look cool....but the acting might be total shit....im still gonna see it though
nlvYKl1fjBIdelimeterByIshita@xASYxLUMx  Do your research, kiddo.

Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhy Is It Called Southpaw If He Fights Orthodox??
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThe Next Rocky &lt;3
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWOW!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be a heartbreak 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks like such a downer.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaDaaamn!!!!NOO! IM GETTING ANGRY WITH THESE TRAILERS!they show too much... :((((
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaReal steel with real people :P  But Jake is still an awesome actor this trailer just shows how much effort he has put in this movie. Good luck. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaBut why 50 cent?.....
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThe pacing of this movie looks very strange, but DAMN do I want to believe this will be good! The casting for this seems top-notch. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake wins .. duh.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhat eminem song is this?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI wonder who dies in this movie.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s Rocky 8, is that what it is?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitajake gyllenhaal is the actor of the moment, nightcrawler, enemy, prisoners, zodiac and now this. i can&#39;t not hype this movie, even though the trailer was shitty 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitadoes anybody know the name of the song at the end?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThe many faces of jake ......yeah storys old but... looks cool..<br>
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaSo he wins the fight, gets his daughter goes home and sleeps happily in his bed. Minutes later, a huge jet engines crashes through the roof, killing him.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaA little bit of Rocky where he goes back to his old gym and the trainer tells him he didn&#39;t listen before haha. Still gonna watch it 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it&#39;s going to be a Rocky road for The Fighter in this film unless he spends a Million Dollars on his Baby.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaLooks good nd this is a kurt sutter movie? Isnt he the one who did sons of anarchy?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaOH YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jake Gyllenhaal again delivers another great performance. He keeps just getting better and better and shows no signs of stopping. Well Done Jake Gyllenhaal. No doubt one of this generation&#39;s greatest actors that deserve a lot of attention.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaCool 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaIt must be almost impossible for actors to breakthrough in hollywood when filmmakers insist on recycling the same actors over and over again and casts non-actor celebs like 50 cent! there must be thousand of unused actors more qualified or at least people who can act that could have occupied his role. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThis is as predictable as Warrior, that didn&#39;t stop Warrior to be a great movie. Looking forward for this one, Jake deserves like 2 Oscars already, he has been one of the best actors quite a while now.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaFrom Nightcrawler to this, that must have been a huge change in body weight. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit this looks fantastic. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJust a heads up: The trailer spoils the entire movie.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWell that escalated quickly.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome 😍
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaOona Laurence as the daughter is stunning <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Matilda5ever">#Matilda5ever</a>
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaRegina Gorge!!!!!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake looks BEAST!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhat a drastic change physically from Nightcrawler. Good on you Jake!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitamodern day rocky movie ??
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitamy body.....wasnt ready.....for jake&#39;s...........awesome acting.so gonna watch this.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaFfs just watched the whole movie
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they have to spoil the movie!!? It would have been awesome
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or Jake resembles Cm Punk?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaRocky wanna be 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaSo many spoilers in this trailer... It ruined the movie.. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaGeez show the whole movie why don&#39;t ya
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaeverything just seems so overblown dont you guys tihnk i love jake but this seems like a mediocre work of his
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaNever before was I shocked by a trailer this much!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaOk now i definitely see why they wanted Eminem originally for the role
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitawasnt eminem suppose to be in it
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI calls him Fiddy!<br>Movie looks promising. Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s career is REALLY taking off. Great actor.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaTrailers are supposed ti make people curious not give away the whole story
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaNever back down plus real steel together!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaHis body in nightcrawler to the body in this is so impressive
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie is written by Kurt Sutter, it will be phenomenal 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake is a straight beast 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaDay 1, they even got the wannabe gangsta asshole from the Strain who deserves to get his ass whooped. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI hope the movie offers more than that... i feel like i&#39;ve seen the movie already.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitawell, I already know the end of the movie.  And so do you. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome! Definitly gonna watch it
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaMeh I was hoping for a movie about a struggling boxer trying to make ends meet for his family while trying to become big. And in that struggle he those but wealth begins to change him and so his boxing career begins to spiral out of control with drugs, crime and his own downfall and rise. <br><br>This just a movie about a hot head who gets his wife killed because of his temper and tries to get redemption from his daughter by boxing? Dafuq? 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaso this is rocky 8, i guess?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaAYDRIIIIIIIANNE!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaTypical oscar bait movie
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t whait!!!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaSo different to his role in nightcrawler.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshita50 cent!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThis role was originally for Eminem. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely a must see! Jakes transformation is very impressive 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh2ebPxhoLs&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a> Rita Ora?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaDear Oscars, give Jake Gyllenhaal the Oscar he deserves for this movie! Thanks! - The fans.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer spoils way too much that I would&#39;ve waited to see in the movie, but it does look like a good tear jerker. And Jake Gyllenhall has proof at this point, that whatever movie he is in, he&#39;ll be great. He hasn&#39;t been in that many bad movies really. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaPREDICTION: He trains he sobers up gets his life back on track wins the fight gets custody of his daughter! Typical American bullshit, want to make the movie realistic he goes into a depression loses the fight probably died somehow
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI want to see it!
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like another great movie with jake gyllenhaal I swear he&#39;s becoming one of my favorite actors.I like the movie&#39;s he&#39;s been in lately he&#39;s making good choices nightcrawler,enemy,prisoners,end of watch and source code I might be forgetting a couple more but he&#39;s a great actor and at this rate he will win a oscar soon.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhat accent is Jake doing in this movie? 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaGreat actors, great director, GREAT
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m very willing to give this movie a shot because of the fantastic actors, but an &#39;atmospheric&#39; trailer would have been much better in this case, without spoiling her death and the whole story. :/
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI would definitely watch this but stop putting the entire story in the trailer. The trailer is supposed to keep us guessing.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhy put Rachel McAdams in the movie and kill her right in the beginning? 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThis showed a little too much..
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaFresh cycle of PEDs Jake on for this movie
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshita
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaUntil the shot I was thinking it was Rock III revisited.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitadramatic movie with brilliant director. 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake is a phenomenal actor. This is going to be a top class performance. He Fecking deserves an Oscar.  
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake was so skinny in nightcrawler and now he looks like a wwe wrestler.. he&#39;s an actor
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaTrailers now a days reveal way too much of the movie. This seems really good though. I am definitely going to see this movie for sure.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake and Eminem. Doesn&#39;t get much better. hell yeah! 
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhen is it comming out ?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>.......
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaeminem song on the soundtrack... yeah im watching the shit out of this
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I just saw the whole movie.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaGyllenhaal is getting better and better. The movie looks fine. I&#39;m very interested now.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhat the song?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaWhats that EMINEM song??
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaAll i need to see is the ending...since i just saw 80% of it.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer reveal too much. I&#39;m excited about the movie don&#39;t get me wrong. This is the movie Jake Gyllenhaal will be nominated for Academy Awards.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitawho shot his wife?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cliche, but I&#39;ll give it the benefit of doubt only because Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s last movie was great.
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal better not get snubbed for this! He looks great and so does the movie overall
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good but why show significant portions of the movie? where&#39;s the mystery?
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitaOMG  i&#39;m so excited
Mh2ebPxhoLsdelimeterByIshitafirst
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaAs long as there is some bad ass archery in this movie I’m happy.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitableah...looks like shit....not to mention the friggin riot shields killed it...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOn one hand, it&#39;s hard to complain about a modern take on Robin Hood - the legend has been altered numerous times to adapt to changing times, tastes, audiences etc. Much, if not most of what we take for granted as part of the story was introduced to it centuries after it originated. On the other hand, what&#39;s the point of taking a medieval legend and making it exactly like a modern day action heist film? I don&#39;t despise innovation, but if you change too much you might as well drop ther pretense of making a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; movie.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaMeh :(
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be AWESOME! Why can&#39;t it be released sooner. This looks like that King Arthur movie, which deserved a sequel as it was a solid B flick, if they were apart of the same world, that would be a crossover event that I would make me super hyped.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaNothing will ever top Kevin Costner&#39;s Robin Hood...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaugh i&#39;m so sick of movies having a political message!! &quot;we need to steal from the rich and give to the poor&quot; what like in socialist venezuela? ha! stupid libs
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks good
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhy are the leather jackets so modern
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThe cringe is strong with this one. The Three Musketeers (2011) and King Arthur (2017), anyone? What kind of modern hipster clothes are they wearing? Too much short hair. Black Little John? What are Jamie F. and Taron E. doing? Give me Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Robin Hood (1973).
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaCrusader, Moorish Commander, in a different dimension?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOhhhh baby!! This is gonna be good!!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaNot sure what time period or world this is supposed to take place in but.........<br><br><br><br><br>TARON EDGERTON LOOKS SO HOT AND BADASS I CAN&#39;T EVEN!!! 😃❤️
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaAnother blockbuster flop because Hollywood can&#39;t be original. 5 more months of reboots and sequels here we go
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaJamie Dornan!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLadies and gentlemen, welcome to communism!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhy is this exists?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks fun but that soundtrack sounds almost exactly like Pirates of the Caribbean&#39;s
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaYeah, sell the lie! <br>Sell the drug! <br>Take from the poor and give to the rich!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks like shit.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitathis looks so good! taron is looking amazing as always and i can’t wait to see him back in action 😍 and him + jamie = incredible movie!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOk so Little John trains Robin instead of them finding each other and being partners.... What?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwPn9ZnbCo0&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> ❤😍
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhy costumes they look modern!? They should be medieval !!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JamieDornan">#JamieDornan</a> as Will Scarlet 😍😍😍😍🙌🙌🙌🙌🤘
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI will watch this only for Tim Minchin
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaTim Minchin!!!!!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitawheres the johnny depp jack sparrow cameo
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaNot really Robin Hood. They could have called it something else and it still would have made money.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re not Robin of Loxley anymore<br>You &#39;re a Hidden One.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaSo basically Marcus in Detroit: Becoming Human
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaso this is basically Arrow in the 16th Century
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer has so many confusing/conflicting elements that is not even funny...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaKevin Costner was the best robin hood, then Russell crowe
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis... looks... weird...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaUgh.... sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo dumb.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI don’t even have anything bad to say.. this looks good
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaAssassins Creed meets every other mentor movie since the original Karate Kid.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaRobin hood<br>They gave a new meaning for the name <br>I like that
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaSpeaking of putting the entire movie in the trailer...

zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhen I main sniper with the huntsman
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWho else recognizes the actor for the main villain? I may be wrong but I think he played <b>Nolan Sorrento</b> from <b>Ready Player One.</b>
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitahere before 300k views🤗🤗🤗🤗
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaHorrible costumes too clean,too modern. it seems like a James Bond movie with a little of wild wild west touch. Don&#39;t like it. Not at all what i expect from a Robin Hood movie.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good... also is that Christian Grey?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaNope.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaIt looks like they turned Robin Hood into antifa.

zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI smell a recent King Arthur-destiny for this flick. Both financially and critically.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitasweet jesus this looks absolutely awful. anyone that thinks that looks good is a fking idiot. I mean, everyones entitled to their own opinion, no matter how blatantly wrong it is.  just like to thank all those idiots for being the reason hollywood keeps churning out trash movies like this....
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis is NOT Robin Hood!<br><br>Where&#39;s Prince John, where&#39;s Sir Guy of Gisborne, where&#39;s Marion...where&#39;s the pageantry?!<br><br>Here I thought Hollywood molested King Arthur&#39;s name in the worst way possible. Now, it seems they&#39;re screwing up Robin!<br><br>Who&#39;s next, Joan of Arc...or what about the Musketeers? Seriously, how is it that they got these characters right in the old days. But today, with all our &quot;special&quot; effects and computers, people can&#39;t do these stories right
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a lot of fun, but not like Robin Hood.  Actually, this looks like a better concept for the failed Assassin&#39;s Creed movie.  Also, the costumes remind me of A Knight&#39;s Tale, in that they are not period appropriate in the slightest.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaPair of Taron and Jamie Foxx will blow your mind in theatre this November...<br>Be ready...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOMG!!! THIS LOOKS AMAZING! I am definitely seeing this when it comes out to theaters.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaAm I the only one that thought he was Tom holland
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaShooting a bow from a region 100, 000 miles away.  Englishman shooting a composite horn bow? I don’t think so.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s not even close..., IMDb ~5.2 (at best)<br><br>It would be OK if the title was Robin Re-loaded or something...<br><br>My opinion
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaIs no one going to talk about how Tim Minchin is in this movie. He is a comedian and song writer how did something like this come to be? I am going to see it just for him.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThe clothing doesn&#39;t look medieval to me, but what do I know this looks great anyways
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaso Robin Hood wearing a 21st century jacket? lol the outfits look so wrong for this era
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaJust change the title end everything will be ok. :D
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwPn9ZnbCo0&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> when Taron Egerton bounce on Hugh Jackman&#39;s dick
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaBro am most definitely watching this
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitacant wait just cause it has eggsy from kingsman and Jamie foxx
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaGonna go see it only for Jamie Dornan reason
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaARE WE BLIND??? DEPLOY THE GARRISON!!!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWill Lil John be raping? <br>What 4  some people make 100 versions of the same story. <br>PS - their costumes... oh my...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis looks way better than I expected
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna watch it just for eggsy
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t you let the whites have their culture? Why does Robinhood need the guidance of a Blackman who was not in England at the time? I suppose it&#39;s better than that early 2000&#39;s Kong Arthur which portrayed Gwenivere as a leather bikini-clad Forest warrior.<br><br>Anything that hints SJW, I avoid.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be one of those movies that ya whip out when you wanna watch a simple action movie when nothing else is on.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaDirector Krennic
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaMeh... I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll make a good rainy day movie night rental at home :P
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWow Wow Wow Awesome<br>Please Release In Hindi🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWtf is this casino?!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaNovember is still too loooong~ can&#39;t wait!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaJamie Foxx the 🐐
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks better than assassins creed
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaWhat on earth is the time period here?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis is fuckin awesome 🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅🙅
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaGreen Arrow (?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m probably in the minority here, but I think this looks great!<br><br>Also I came into this comment section prepared to make fun of Jamie Foxx&#39;s fake English accent, but... I like it? A lot? How did that happen?
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaand even more goofy action packed remake, I&#39;d rather they just make another with Russel crowe
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaFeels like it&#39;s in the same universe as King Arthur: Legend of the Sword
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks awful... I like Jamie Foxx, but i just don&#39;t prefer the type of production. No one in those times wore those type of outfits. If you&#39;re gonna do a modern take, film it like the 1998 version of Romeo and Juliet movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaAnother modern remake that literally nobody asked for
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be the movie that will be the impetus for revolution here in America.
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still prefer the Disney version...
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaPlease don’t sucks!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaBefore the Kingsman era, Eggsy&#39;s great-great-great-great grandfather is a Crusader!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaTypical
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaLooks awasome
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaPlz dub in hindi
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOMG! I can&#39;t wait to see the movie and Jamie
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaOooo I&#39;m so excited for this movie!!!  Can&#39;t waitttt
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaTaron is so perfect 💜😍
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaCan wait looks good
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaThis....looks good!
zwPn9ZnbCo0delimeterByIshitaDamnnnnn
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaDid anyone noticed the hidden frame in the video?<br><br>Try to watch on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHprLW48no&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a>
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaYou guys think this movie is shit? May I remind you of The Super Mario Bros movie, Need For Speed, Street Fighter: Something about Chun-Li and so on. Yeah, calm your tits this movie looks pretty great.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThank you Sony 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThe Iwatani part was pretty funny but I don&#39;t know about the rest of the movie. 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitalooks entertaining
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaAn Adam Sandler movie? no, thanks
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitai was interested on this until i saw Adam Sandler as main character
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI am hyped up for this movie right now 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI like the looks of this .......... but being a PAC-MAN fan is the only thing holding me back. I do understand why they made him a main villain (what is a better wepeons than a giant yellow ball that eats EVERYTHING)
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaPaul Blart, Tyrion Lannister and Olaf saving the world against classic video game characters? Count...Me...In!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaDont you know Adam Sandler is bad luck, this movie is going to be terrible just because hes in it, its only saving grace is Peter Dinklage, personally i would switch Adam Sandler out with Chris Pratt because hes also known for starring in 3 movies in one year, anyway honestly it looks intriguing but don&#39;t get your hopes up.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaFUTURAMA !!!!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLooks like an expensive MINI commercial,
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis could work. It may actually be good. The trailer was good, at least.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna be like every nerd&#39;s dreams.<br><br>for all of you who think that christopher columbus is such shitty director. remember, he&#39;s the one who direct harry potter 1,2,4. if you expect this one to be perfect, then you were wrong, but i think this should fun at least. keep your expectation as low as possible..<br><br>and stop saying something stupid..
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else see a flash of like a poster with a girl on it at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHprLW48no&amp;t=1m36s">1:36</a>
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLMAO. Hilarious. Cant wait to see this. Genius idea.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitashut up and take my money!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitawat even lul
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLooks EPICCCCCCCCC!!!!!! I absolutely love video games so I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this in the theater. 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitatriggered
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be a weird movie...<br><br>hopefully good weird, but weird is inevitable. We could do so much better with video game movies....
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitastupidninja6 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshita<b>jaw drops</b>
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaAhaha this movie actually looks like fun :)
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaUgh Josh Gad and Kevin James and Adam Sandler? Ruined.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI know it&#39;s Sony&#39;s movie division, but it&#39;s still weird seeing a nintendo product in a sony product.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaOmg Yes.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThe best game movie ever~
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaFinally a Adam sandler movie that looks good
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaPeter Dinklage?!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaDonkey Kong?....DONKEY KONG!?!?!?!? - JonTron.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis is so weird... I LOVE IT.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaSe ve tan estupida que tienen mi boleto 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaUnlock Lady Lisa at dojoquest.com...huh ok?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaAlso, I demand a Mario appearance on this!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaSONY sorry,  Adam Sandler is fail.......
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWow, This Wreck It Ralph sequel looks good!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitathis movie looks really bad
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaINCREIBLE VOLVEMOS A LOS VIEJOS TIEMPOS 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaYES. yes yes oh my god
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaanybody know who&#39;s the guy at the end of this video ?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaBenis
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaOf course the are the only gamers in  the world 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Wreck It Ralph? LOL
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaOK, I think I&#39;m gonna love this movie.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis looks really stupid i just want to watch it to see how crap it is
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis looks insanely stupid and insanely fun. I&#39;m going to cautiously look forward to it, expecting nothing.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitathis will either be really good or complete dogshit
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLooks good. 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLol
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll admit it looks like it can be good. I&#39;m definitely going to watch it.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI honestly did not expect this to be Adam Sandler..... Can&#39;t wait to see this.... On the movie channel..... on a dull night.... with literally nothing better to do.... And nothing good on youtube.... after watching the right amount of porn....
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaso many crappy cliches
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaAt least the part Adam Sandler is playing here seems to fit him.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaIn the last 15 years,Sandler movies have been crap...could this be the one to bring him back to a decent level?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaYes
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis is either gonna be the best thing ever or the worst thing ever.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is probably going to suck because of Adam Sandler. 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks amazing!!! 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a parody trailer from the Simpsons... 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaHoly shit why aren&#39;t i in it?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitafuturama plzzzz!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis honestly looks like the coolest movie ever...
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s up with the subliminal message insert for Dojo Quest at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHprLW48no&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a>? I can&#39;t be the only one seeing this...<br>Anyhow, movie looks pretty neat so far! Let&#39;s hope this is better than most of what Sandler&#39;s been doing for the last couple years...
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI feel as if it would&#39;ve been better if  the probe was sent in 2010 or so, or maybe be set in the future instead
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got a two liter bottle of Shasta, and my all Rush mixtape.  Let&#39;s do this.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitano haters for adam.. he is my favorite comedy actor so excited to watch this so fun...!!!!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWOOOOHHHH!!!!!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAHprLW48no&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> UNLOCK Lady Lisa at <a href="http://dojoquest.com">dojoquest.com</a> Anyone saw that ?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLoved the original short video from a few years ago, and I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this.<br><br>Let&#39;s hope Sandler doesn&#39;t &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; this up.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaSo other then the cool visual effects and concept, the execution looks terrible. Also this is the most generic trailer in the world. BLAH BLAH meant for peace, BWAW, we were wrong, BWAW, EXPLOSIONS, BWAW, more explotions, BWAW, were serious, just kidding it&#39;s funny towards the end (even though it&#39;s not). Why is it so serious? It&#39;s a movie about video characters coming to life and invading earth. This should&#39;ve been the Ghost Busters of video games movies but it already looks awful.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaIt looks like Ghostbusters with video game characters.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThe concept is awesome, plus it&#39;s also directed by Chris Columbus although the screenplay is written by Tim Herlihy who wrote the stupid Grown Ups 2 with Adam Sandler. It can go either way. 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaOMG OMG OMG, FUCK YES!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaFUTURAMA DID IT! <br><br>Sorry, had to.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaOh my god this movie looks so stupid I love it
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis looks meh, but Iwatani meeting Pacman was awesome. Hopefully there&#39;s more character development to Pacman and Donkey Kong than Sandler&#39;s character.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks pretty stupid. I just wanna sew how many references are in it
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaWhat is this? The Lego Movie 2? Omg...
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaMeh, it looks OK.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaEverytime i get excited i remember Sandler, Kevin James and Gadd are in it and i get sad... but then Pac-Man so yay... but Sandler... but Pac-Man...
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaHere comes to Adam Sandler haters
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome ;)
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaMy body is ready!
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaLol okay, what the fuck did I just watch?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitalooks decent, but why is sandler here?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaNo thanks.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThat looks dreadful 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaIs this movie supposed to be taken seriously ?
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaActually looks pretty cool. Not awesome or perfect, but definetly enjoyable. We&#39;ll just have to see though :) 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaNot gonna lie, this looks pretty dumb.  I mean, all I saw was Pac man and donkey kong
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaId watch that but only if its free
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/XAHprLW48no?t=2m17s">2:17</a> Poor daddy.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaPlease Stop Adam Sandler! 
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaThis could be Adam Sandler&#39;s best movie in years.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaCant wait
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshita &quot;somebody annihilate this stupid thing&quot; my exact thoughts on this film.
XAHprLW48nodelimeterByIshitaAye that looks....<br>Pretty cool actually
