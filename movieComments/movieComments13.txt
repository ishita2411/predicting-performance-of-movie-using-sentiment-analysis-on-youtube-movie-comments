lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitaThey should have give Brian Cox more credit for these films.
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitaIf you&#39;ve never seen the movie,  it&#39;s still a must see !!!  An all star cast and each one funny as hell !!  John Malkovich&#39;s character is outrageously funny.  Gotta see this one.
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitaI love the spinning cop car bit

lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshita@Airbus294 even better =)
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshita@Airbus294 WTF? they dont look 65. they look more like 45
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitaa little bit to the left ...oh just perfect
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitaRED retired elderly double agents OMG Hollywood really shouldn&#39;t supply it&#39;s writers with Drugs.
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitawow, Hollywood is getting better :), very impressed!
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshitais like the Old People version of the Expandables...
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshita@AMGV0119 No, no. I was just saying the movie itself is portraying Bruce as an old person. That is funny I think.
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshita@AMGV0119 Well but Bruce Willis is now playing an &quot;old person&quot; ?????
lwjn6sLl4U8delimeterByIshita@DjDarkArby Yes, it is him. He plays &quot;VP Stanton&quot; Der are usually only a few top names in the end credits of any trailer.

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaWhat‚Äôs the name of the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a>
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaAdore esa pel√≠cula la extra√±o mucho
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI laughed throughout this movie..üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br>And the ending it just killed meüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitais this seriously a movie? a boring guy gets a girl out of his league. she starts disenchanting him with the fact that she&#39;s human and farts or whatever. he sees flaws and immediately likes the next woman he comes across. who is also out of his league. and his wife is burned really bad and he just cares for banging this other chick. if the movie doesn&#39;t end with both women finding out and kicking his butt, this movie sucks hairy balls.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is funny (technically) but the message behind is awful. He didn&#39;t even take his time to know the girl well and rushed into marriage to end up hating her for her imperfections and for who she really is then hitting on another woman with less imperfections while still married !
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI feel like he&#39;s the kind of guy who doesn&#39;t fall in love with the girls, but the idealized versions of them. And once they start showing flaws or parts he doesn&#39;t like, he bounces and finds a new more perfect girl. In the end, it&#39;ll always be how the girlfriends were crazy or monsters or whatever and not how he can&#39;t keep a partnership with a truly human person, that isn&#39;t a doll.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitai thought this was shawn michaels movie...LoL
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaLmaoo im dead af at when she says I love you and hes like I love love love love üòÇ
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis is by far one of the best comedies of this decade. Watched it again. 12 years later, it still holds up !
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a> should&#39;ve been in the car

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=2m18s">2:18</a> too bad they put it in trailer , i saw the movie without seeing the trailer and i laughed from the bottom of my heart , i think people wont laugh it out when they see it first here

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaLua de mel no M√©xico, Cancun.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThe original was so much better with Cybill Shepherd and Charles Griffin. Why is Hollywood always doing remakes? Are they running out of ideas?
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s annoying me is that she nearly dropped the puppy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a>
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is awesome.  So funny

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaTypical over acting
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie, seen it so many times.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaWould have been epic to see a cameo of Shawn Michaels
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks soo messed up.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaSince when did Shawn Michaels make a movie

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaEver since i felt for her, i havent cheated on her with my wife. This killed me.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis is a tragic romantic comedy not a simple romantic comedy like show this trailer
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite comedy movie i ever see
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaJulieta Venegas &lt;3 <br><br>Song name is Canciones de Amor
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaEverything was great until the ending. Should have stuck with the romantic ending.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaSuprised Shawn Michaels isn&#39;t in the movie
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaFirst time in a while that I regret watching something. Should&#39;ve stuck with Pearl Harbor.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitalove love love  love this moovie  :-D
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a remake from a 1972 film with Charles Grodin - which is much better!
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaAwesome Movie

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaWhere the fuck&#39;s Shawn Michaels?
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think 2007 should be considered classic bad call...
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitathe trailer is so funny!
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie üé• it&#39;s so funny.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitagreat movie.

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaname of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a>
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThis is great movie, very funny but this trailer reveals too much, i am glad i haven&#39;t seen it before watching the movie.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitathumbs up ¬†whoever watched this movie because the directors did &quot;something about mary&quot;!
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaOne of ben stillers funnniest movies
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaHb
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON1-SohDqDg&amp;t=02m02s">02:02</a> that part kills me everytime! And it&#39;s even funnier if you speak spanish lol
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaUgh Ben stillers character is such an arsehole in this film ._.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI liked the movie, but hated the main character. I wished him all the shit that&#39;s been happening to him. And more, after seeing how the movie ended. That guy was trash, a girl like Lila was all that he deserved.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaGreat and funny, Five of Five Stars. Ben Stiller The Best !.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaHorrible and ugly movie. Not funny and dirty I lost my time for watch this crap.Ôªø

ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaI hated this movie! ¬† It was one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen! ¬† The ending is horrible.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaThat looks really funny!
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaIf you need a laugh - you can&#39;t go wrong with this film. ¬† It is really funny so enjoy....
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaMost trailers these days give away the whole plot.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaFor now on people when they comment on youtube should automatically put the date in. We need to show our strength.¬†<br>A great Idea i just came up with, seriously.
ON1-SohDqDgdelimeterByIshitaweird ass movie

XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitathis movie makes me cut my veins for watching too many straights, cars, vroomvroom, etc
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaFor me, this is the worst movie of Dwayne.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaJack Reacher Prequel
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaA must watch movie!
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaHis revolver is the infamous Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan chambered in .454 casullüí•üò±
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaPile of shite
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis November, the fate of the country will be decided. We must all act faster than the Democrats who will try to enslave and/or kill us.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaGood film
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaEn la parte donde jhonson va con su carro se encuentra con el sicario al final del video pero no se ve cuando jhonson lo mataaa .....
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaŸÖÿßÿ¥Ÿä ÿØÿ∫ÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ≥
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaAm I in the simulation? This movie is hilarious dog shit, am I getting whooshed?
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaYup... During that era Rock take acting seriously. Now he&#39;s just trying so hard to show off his muscles and do comedy movies
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie!
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis is actually still the best Dwayne Johnson film.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis is a very nice movie
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis movie teaches about revenge and forgiving better than TLOU2.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWait a minute this isnt dax his new song
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaDwayne did the killing like no other action movies ever did, little dialogue, not wordy just straight to the point: murder. Unlike other movies that involves the protagonists to talk a lot before killing the villain which is unnecessary and absurd.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaTop
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes little justice to the actual movie, the amount of tension that the movie portrays is kind of underwhelmed by this trailer that makes it look like an action film with that music and the edits, when in reality is a slow, unnervingly paced movie where blood pumps because shit gets extremely tense at moments (Judas scene for example or the old man&#39;s killing).
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWhy did none of the characters have any names?
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWho is here while lockdown....
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaLove the twist ending!! This is üî•üî•üî•
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why this movie is so underrated ..
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaGood movie...apart from the awful english actor involved
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWell did Mafia 3 developers att least payed the authors of this script?
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWatch this film !
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaNice Chevelle.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaTHE ROCK was brilliant, Thorton was so-so, some supporting actors were also great, but what fucks up this movie is unnecessary &quot;James Bond wannabe&quot; assassin with his idiotic childish actor who completely ruins it for me.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaOh, how I have missed this trailer.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitarented this at some point a VERY long time ago, good movie. I may have downloaded it also or streamed it not sure.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitagreat movie
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWatch it
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitastrong start.... weak middle part... ending got better.<br>still i prefer movies with at least one good guy... but there is basically none.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaI hate ‚Äö‚Äò‚Äòthe cop ‚Äû
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaüëåüèªüî•üîû
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaHell yeah cannot stop watching this movie
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaLooks cheesy
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis man said 11 words in the whole movie and this trailer made it seem a lot better than it was
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song plz?
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaCriminally underrated movie
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitagregory from the walking dead shitt
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaNever even heard of it until today when I saw it on Amazon Prime Video. Which is weird, cause I thought I&#39;d seen all of his movies. Not to mention, this is the kind of movie I like. They must have not marketed this at all!ü§Ø
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaOne of his best movies
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWhy doesn&#39;t Novak Djokovic act anymore??? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDBeFAlgjio&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a>
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitavery recognizable cast
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis deserved a lot more
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaWtf , why is yt recommend this now in 2019
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaDwayan jackon
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaBlessed and Unstoppable
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaBilly bob Thornton and the epic track short change hero  üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaDwayne ‚ù§
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is criminally underrated. Beautifully filmed, iconic camera angles (namley the one from the speedometers point if view), fantastic soundtrack, stand out performances from Dwayne Johnson and The Preacher (don&#39;t know his name), and some of the best car chase/getaway sequences of all time. Especially the shot of the Pontiac GTO doing a 180¬∞ reversal turnaround.<br><br>It&#39;s the best 1970&#39;s action/revenge/muscle car movie that was made in the 21st century.
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaNice trailer
XDBeFAlgjiodelimeterByIshitaBad plot not one of The Rock&#39;s best movies

KrAf5ALLxGIdelimeterByIshitahahaha
KrAf5ALLxGIdelimeterByIshitalooks fun
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshita&quot;Men need to be pushed?&quot;<br>Umm, yea, nope.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJust watched the whole movie thanks to the trailer. I can tell josh groban really fits the part here.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaEmily blunt husband is directing. this could be interesting. I thought that John krasinski was terrific in 13 hours earlier this year.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitastupid and gay
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is <b>everywhere</b> and I&#39;m okay with that. :)  This film looks great!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaok, i will see this.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitathis looks bad. this is where I leave you is better.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitamore pretentious Hollywood crap chalk full of overrated and untalented actors that belong working at Burger King
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer for almost a year! Finally it&#39;s here! John Krasiniski and Anna Kendrick‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèº
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJohn Krasinski.  :)
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJohn Krasinsky, Josh Groban, that Sharlto guy I don&#39;t know but is hot, Richard Jenkins - nice cast !
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThe feels tho.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaLost in my Mind - The Head and the Heart
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty funny.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Jim &amp; Asian JimüòÇ
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaToo... Much...Kendrick!!!!!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitathis looks better than La La Land
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else notice how Anna Kendrick is in almost every single 2016 movie? She&#39;s unstoppable.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitathis looks really solid
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitahow does anna kendrick have the time?? I feel like she&#39;s in 7 new movies??
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJim &amp; Asian Jim :)
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI love feel good movies, John Krasinski definitely got some inspiration from working with Cameron Crowe. Can&#39;t wait to see this and add it to my movie collection so I can watch it multiple times
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick.. How does she even have time to do all these movies?!?
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJim baby I love you but this movie doesn&#39;t look good
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaFWP level 10
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaReal Jim and Asian Jim together. Jims friend is also an actor and a doctor really pushing the Asian stereotype there
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThe title of this movie should be &quot;no one cares&quot;
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t take john serious anymore after watching 13 hours and the office
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaIs Anna Kendrick the only young actress in the planet? Too much of her lately! I like her, but I&#39;m getting tired of seeing her.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaSo the monster destroys everything the boy doesn&#39;t like? Oh wait, wrong trailer.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitayou had me at Charlie Day
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitacharacter actor Margo Martindale!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThis looks good!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick&#39;s agent is amazing...
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaanything with John I&#39;ll watch!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaPregnant Anna Kendrik<br><br><br><br><br>MOOOOMMM!!!!! my tingle wingle feels funny
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaDecent cast but this movie looks lame
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaCharacter Actress Margo Martindale!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitainstantly hooked because of John
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is in it - so I&#39;ll watch it.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick again? ?
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWHAT HAPPENED TO PAM, JIM?!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitadamnnn,anna kendrick is like female nicholas cage now, she&#39;s everywhere
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaLooks like Charlie gave up on bird law and became a doctor!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaMARY ELIZABETH I LOVE YOU! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Venezuela">#Venezuela</a>
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Kim Jun UGHHHHH!!!!!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaPretty solid cast of B list actors. Should be good. btw the song is &quot;Lost In My Mind&quot; by The Head and The Heart! Great band
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI like these actors a lot, but all these movies about these boring families are just that BORING! Stop making them!!!!!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAll i can think about is.... Where&#39;s pam
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awful
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitawow so Jim and asian Jim in the same movie
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI had high expectations for this, especially since it&#39;s John Krasinski&#39;s directorial debut, but it looks a bit TV movie-ish. <br>Still optimistic though!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M TELLING PAM ON YOU!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI like the cast
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaIt looks alright but I&#39;m literally never gonna see this movie ngl lol
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWhat a great cast. gonna watch it for sure..
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshita13 hours of Benghazi to this??????
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitawhy the hell does that pointy faced ginger troll keep popping up in every damn movie trailer that looks like it may be good? doesn&#39;t she ever sleep?
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWhat a cast
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWow, this is the calmest I&#39;ve seen Charlie Day‚Ä¶ and Sharlto Copley.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitawow another john krazinski family comedy movie....
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWritten and Directed by John Krasinski himself. Looks like a pretty well put together movie for his first one.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWatching it for Charlie day
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWow this cast is insane! Hope this is good, looks incredibly mediocre..
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaOh hey Anna Kendrick, haven&#39;t seen you in a while..<br>...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>...<br>dsfkjasjda<br>jfsdj
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnybody else just watch whatever John Krasinski is in? As long as he&#39;s in it, they have my money
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJust gonna say this now , not a huge fan on Anna kendrick, john krasinksi however i am.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDm-hMnvB44&amp;t=1m29s">1:29</a> reminds me of The Office when Jim is spying on his ex with Dwight and Michael
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitahahaha hardcore henry
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJim is that you? JIIIIIIIIMMMM!!!!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to watch it only for Mary Elizabeth Winstead plus Anna Kendrick is having such a year with movies
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThis looks cute
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI love how Jim is with that actor friend of his hahahahaha
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAyyyy Jim
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshita(Sees this in my subscription) (squints) is that....Jim?
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWow daredevil isn&#39;t daredevil!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaomg its wikus van de merwe &lt;3
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny all people are going to talk about is &quot;The office&quot;. Did you hear that guys? He&#39;s having twins just like in the office with pam
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaFokkin prawn!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitasup Jim
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaLooks very cliche. But I&#39;m intrigued because of the cast.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaSharlto Copley cannot get rid of his accent haha
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJIM!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitameh
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaThats not Pam? Where&#39;s Michael and Dwight? Wth?
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI like Mary Elizabeth winstead more than Anna Kendrick
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitalooks a bit like me
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaEven without watching a movie i can say it&#39;s very touching. Margo&#39;s example just proves that have to spend more time with out parents until it&#39;s too late. Regarding the busyness and other aspects that we use as a point not to visit hometown and your parents, we are to remember that family is the most precious gift in the world.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaEARLY
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJim halpert and Ramona flowers? I&#39;m sold
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaDefinitely watching this one!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is in everything now...
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJIM
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaI clicked on this so damn fast ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I love John
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaAnyone noticed the doctor was &quot;the fake Jim&quot; in the office prank against Dwight
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaOk I&#39;m calling it. Year of the Kendrick.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaJim and Asian Jim?? Whaaaat?!?!
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshita1st
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaWow. That&#39;s a great cast.
gDm-hMnvB44delimeterByIshitaHi
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaTHE BEST ¬†UNDERRATED MOVIE IN 2014!!!!!!¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaBy definition, something spiritual can&#39;t proof anythings. It&#39;s bullshit, a lie, a myth, a fairy tale, a false conclusion.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWEAK¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaIs it worth watching‚Äîfor philosophical reasons?
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaOh it&#39;s from the director that made Another Earth. Good to know, so I don&#39;t watch it.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis is not a trailer - it&#39;s closer to a 3 min version of the entire movie
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis was a great film and very emotionally involving. I&#39;m glad I watched it before seeing this trailer as it gives away a lot of important scenes and kinda spoils it. If you liked this you should watch Cafe De Flore and also Upstream Colour (by the genius director/writer Shane Carruth), which is very abstract and has been called pretentious, but I found it to be very profound and it really affected me in a deep way.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaOh look.....another new age wack job movie.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a trailer, it&#39;s a supercut of the movie. Spoils nearly everything.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaAs a cognitive science student, I found this movie extremely interesting. Do recommend.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitalooks sad, I mean really bad¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaJajaja un chiste el trailer, te cuenta toda la pel√≠cula.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie but a terrible trailer.<br><br>If you can switch off and watch the movie before the trailer.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaNew-Age Bullshit: The Motion Picture
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaIm looking for the title of the song ! I cant find it, any help guys ??
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing i took from this movie was that Brit Marling has the appearance of a female who experiences a lot of vaginal problems.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaComo puede tener una pelicula tan hermosa 100 no me gusta ?
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI loved it, I loved the concept, the meaning and symbolism, and the equal representation of science and spirituality in the movie. The trailer partially gives away what happens, but not at all everything. If you&#39;re looking for action though, you should go watch The Avengers or something (which totally kicks ass too btw).
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWorst trailer ever!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis same tired story again - ¬†&quot;foolish scientists, so obsessed with facts and proof that they&#39;re blind to the REAL truth, the spiritual truth...&quot; blah fucking blah. Yawn
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshita2 turds 11/11
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitai did a shit 11/11
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitathank god I watched the movie already, the trailer would&#39;ve ruined it.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI keep thinking this is some artsy photographer&#39;s essay and then smacks you with a cliche children&#39;s love story. wait.. it is exactly that.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaNot amazing movie, but at least you wont feel like your money and time is wasted. First 50 min are kinda boring with a lot of love aspects and two scenes that keeps you watching past the 50 min mark ( without those i would&#39;ve &quot;left the cinema&quot; ). After that movie becomes more thrilling.<br><br>Oh, and do not watch this Trailer.<br><br>Man&#39;s Work guy will not surprise :)
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitathis one looks even worse than Another Earth. I feel sorry for Brit Marling,
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaGood thing this movie is labeled as science fiction, exactly how it should be...
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s another one of these Christian things trying to co-opt science and make a &quot;proof&quot; in the form of a silly movie?
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshita......... That&#39;s it? That&#39;s the movie? Wow!! Amazing and it ought to wins some kind of award for boredom and being a piece of crap - remember The Secret, the book? People get real, the real world doesn&#39;t work like that.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaSynchronicity and reincarnation. ...Welcome to my world
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitavery good film
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaIt was a good movie all the comment saying shit about it are jusy talking out there ass stick to watching teenaged mutant nija turtles
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitawhat if the kid in india is a boy?<br>that&#39;d be some interesting plot twist :D
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaits got the chinese guy from walking dead...movie looks dead tbh
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaMovie is very poetic and really is much much more than the trailer would suggest.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitayeiiii more propaganda from holly wood..... blue eyes and green eyes people are better.... yep keep trying...
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaScientists don&#39;t want to disprove god they want to find answers. Religious people accuse scientists of attempt to disprove god because they are afraid of answers. It&#39;s easer to be ignorant and believe without a proof it&#39;s also terrifying to have a proof that your faith in meaningless.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWtf!? That ugly b!tch at the end scared the hell out of me!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaGreat another eyeball movie
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaSame girl from Another Earth.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> name of song?¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaShe is so beautiful
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaglenn!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWhy did they just tell us that Sofi dies...
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaHey glenns in this movie
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis is the worst trailer of a potentially good movie ever....
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaOnly people with a VERY superficial knowledge of science could believe the premises of this movie. At the very least the author should‚Äôve dig into Social Sciences for a helping hand. This movie is like comparing what a elementary schoolboy knows about Mathematics with what a Mathematician handle; from the perspective of those who don‚Äôt know, the schoolboy ‚Äúseems to know‚Äù; no, he doesn‚Äôt. But then, the need to feel certain emotions overcomes whatever that seems to disprove or disable those emotions. Science is not against feelings, science by the methods that builds its structure, is prepared to test assertions and discard lies, even the pretty ones; but there is still room for pretty truths. Sometimes art is used as a healing instrument to recover validation (to ignite certain reassuring emotions), this is an example and this is beyond the quality of the product.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie tries to come across as an existential journey into the soul whereas it is actually just a predictable snore-fest, and I didn&#39;t even see the trailer beforehand, that is how ridiculously predictable this is. The first half of this movie sets up plot points which disappear in an instant and then the movie goes off on a tangent and begins to make you question, was it worth sitting through that past hour of exposition when it could have been summarised in a flashback or any other means of visual storytelling. Lackluster acting, cinematography, direction, soundtrack and everything in between. Just a horrendous pile of garbage. Yep, I hated this movie, down to my core, and by extension, I hate the Cardiff branch of Cineworld Cinemas.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitawhere can i download this?!!?!?!?
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaloved the movie. its different and good.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitawhere can i watch this??
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty great. In the beginning of the trailer I thought about The Number 23 and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=11h11m11s">11:11:11</a> but quickly the trailer moved into a different direction. A better one (not saying The Number 23 is bad)! I will definitely watch this. Another Earth was breathtaking and if this one is even half as good it will still be great.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the point to watch the entire movie now after this trailer? :D
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitawhat a fucking horrid movie if the director was in front of me right now id fucking turkey slap their fucking eye
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a let down like Another Earth...great concept but slow build up to nothing
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was a prequel to I,robot 
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should be called &quot;Dem Eyes Tho...&quot;
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen this movie, and I am only here to say: Do not watch this fucking terrible trailer. You will ruin an otherwise amazing movie. Watch the movie. Skip the trailer.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why everyone is taking issue with or insulting this movie. I saw it today with a friend and I absolutely loved it. &lt;3 I wish I could see it again honestly - I wonder if/when it&#39;ll be released on DVD. I ended this movie in tears, it really touched me and I thought it was pretty interesting. And to me it was a breath of fresh air with its originality. :) Plus I really adore Michael Pitt and his acting.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaBrit Marling!!!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI am a person who believes in science aswell... But i do believe in supernatural things aswell... Because as much as i like that there is proof of what exists then i think that there are things that we can&#39;t prove exist too but yet they still kind of are there... Like Bigfoot... Unfortunately my country dont show this movie at the cinema but i will gladly pay full price for the DVD when it comes out
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaAmazing
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWow, is this The Do I hear? I loove this band :3, SOLD ! (event if the sudo-science bullshit will probably piss me off &gt;_&lt;...)
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I wanna see this movie is because for almost 3 years I see 1111 or 111 EVERYWHERE. I need to know wtf it means because this is far from being a coincidence. .. It&#39;s on license plates, video games, movies, clocks, receipts, credit cards.. like wth?
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWell. This was retarded.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitai think i just saw the whole movie in the trailer... wtf
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI have felt deeply connected to someone I barely knew before and it seems to happen to me all the time.¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaBasically 90 minutes to idiots doing stupid things and talking about nothing. Of course lots of people will say &quot;It&#39;s artistic so it&#39;s genius.&quot; *Yawn
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s looks so cool
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWhen does this movie come out? 
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m waiting for the other side of this movie to be made. The one that doesn&#39;t plug god into the areas in which science can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t understand yet. 
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaJust watch whole movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=3m01s">3:01</a>
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI belive in afterlife, this looks like an good movie :)
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitabravi,belli!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaHeh. He looks like Pewds lol
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitadiaturbing
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie should end with the quotation by Ambrose Beirce:<br><br>&quot;Love:¬† Temporary insanity either curable by the removal of the afflicted from the source of the affliction or by marriage.&quot;¬†<br><br>As to the question, &quot;What would you do if something spiritual disproved your scientific beliefs?&quot;¬† First thing, recheck evidence and test it to see if it can happen again.¬† Otherwise it&#39;s just coincidence or wish-fulfillment following wishful thinking.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitascientific beliefs? kidding me dawg
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitathis trailer kind of ruined the movie. they didn&#39;t have to show her dying or the guy finding the girl¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaGlenn!!! 
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshita&quot;maybe the eye really is some kind of window to the soul&quot; i fucking threw up all over my keyboard thanks
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaSo...what&#39;s the pointe of this movie? 
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> &#39;what&#39;s behind the door?&#39; - list of emotions, and lollipops, and rainbows and unicorns!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaFrom watching this trailer this is what I got. He met the Devonne girl in the ad. They feel in love. She dies. Then, he meet an Indian girl with the same pair of eyes as his gf. He&#39;s blown away. Some realization. End of movie. Am I correct?Ôªø
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaJesus said &quot;So it will be at the end of the age,the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;Matthew <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=13m49s">13:49</a>-50. Jesus also said &quot;You are my friends if you do what I command you.&quot; John <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk4briOLrTQ&amp;t=15m14s">15:14</a>. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaA book called &quot;the stones cry out&quot; by archaeologist Randall Price shows a lot of archaeology that supports the Bible.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaYes, the trailer does show a lot, but there is a whole lot more to this movie. I saw it the other day and it was pretty good!¬†
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaLooks good ty movie trailers.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t believe in any gods especially as portrayed in any so called holy book. However reincarnation is still more plausible than heaven hell scenario since energy never dies. What if the light you see at the end of the tunnel is you being reborn. Lol  :)
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know which is more retarded, the plot, or these two acting as scientists
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaWe just basically watched the whole movie in 3 minutes. wtf..
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaFulthy christian reincarnation propaganda shite. Just like noahs ark.
Mk4briOLrTQdelimeterByIshitaFulthy christian reincarnation propaganda shite. Just like noahs ark.

SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitai wonder if they got in touch with yogi (the guy who made the song in the background) because he sampled entourage in the first song he ever released..... that would be cool ^^
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitadefinitely better as TV Drama.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaFrance Can&#39;t wait too ! Vive Entourage !¬†
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitathis looks even worse than I expected.¬†
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson in another movie damn he is like a White Kevin Hart
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a movie which is supposed to be interesting and entertaining and the best bits are shown here?¬†¬† Good luck with that.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaLeave Ari and Drama,you can get rid of everyone else :D
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaHOLYYYYYYY SHIIIIIIITTTTTTTTT

SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaCameo: The Movie
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaFuck me!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!!!!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaQuality. 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWill Nina Agdal be naked in this? 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWhat is song when start trailer.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song in trailer?
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaShit just got real, can&#39;t wait to watch it 1st day 1st show. 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaAll those cameo appearances just to get people to watch the movie. What will they come up w/ next, smh
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song?
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaperfect!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitagod I cant wait to see this! :D
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaI saw rob gronkowski twerking in a black tank top during the boat scene
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaRussel Wilson and Tom Brady! \\m//
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis looks damn good and a proper sendoff for the show. ¬†I have to admit the Warren Buffett cameo surprised me. ¬†
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaNo Alice Eve?
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is gonna be awesome...like everyone u guys know is in this movie .....LITERALLY 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshita¬°Holy shit! Entourage + Ronda Rousey = I can&#39;t wait dude.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awful but I&#39;ll probably watch it 5 times opening weekend
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaIve waited 4 years for this,I hope this aint the only movie there making
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaHahaha, can&#39;t wait!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaTHERE BAAACCCKKKKK!!!!¬†
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaOh, man...what a cameo reel!¬† Fucking EPIC.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWHAT ON EARTH IS CALVIN HARRIS DOING THERE?!?!?!üò±üò±üò±
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaUnfortunately, the high usage of profanity in this movie will not allow me to watch this as how I watched every single Entourage episode before I recommitted my life to Christ. May the good Lord be with Vince, E, Turtle, Drama and only Jesus Himself... can save Ari.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna be priceless
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaMy body is ready.¬†
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaWarren Buffet is in this? Holy crap that&#39;s impressive! He&#39;s only worth about $60,000,000,000
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis whole film could have been condensed into a 10-minute SNL or Funny or Die sketch.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaSex Tape: Oh god<br>Getting married: oh god<br>We need more money: Oh god!<br><br>Ladies and gents, Arie getting fucked more ways then one
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaI had somewhat of a reluctance going into this after hearing from various sources that after a certain point the episodes start to suck horribly. Now that I&#39;ve finished the show, all those sources have been proven wrong. This is the fastest I&#39;ve watched any TV show old or new. On a side note compared to other series finales for HBO shows, such as Boardwalk Empire, Oz, and The Sopranos, the one for Entourage was a bit rushed but it wasn&#39;t a cop out in anyway, shape, or form.<br><br>Hopefully the movie is worth it. After 8 seasons and a long ass gap, nearly everybody from the show back in front/behind the camera, it has to be good.Ôªø
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaLooks SICK Vince!<br><br>Real good work Vinny
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitabeen waiting so long
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is looking like the last season we deserved but never got. Everyone&#39;s where they should be in the progression of their life. No rush and seems to look like entourage. I&#39;m impressed. 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaGET DANA GORDON ON THE LINE I GOT A MOVIE THAT VINCE CANT REFU...oh wait 
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be good!!!!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie better be five Hours Long!...
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaYes... I hope it&#39;s good!!
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaI love Entourage it reminds me of me and my friends we love to eat Taco Bell and stay up late like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGSE_XPF4_g&amp;t=11m30s">11:30</a> playing GTA and we sometimes flirt with other players that seem like they might be a girl.
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaBurial- yogi
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshita&#39;You hear me smiling? This trailer&#39;s got &#39;my balls tingling, man!&#39;
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never watched an episode but I read a synopsis on the series and I feel like I&#39;d like it now that I&#39;m 25... should I binge watch it? This movie looks pretty good. Like humorous, dark witty and slick all in one, I want to see it...
SGSE_XPF4_gdelimeterByIshitaRUSSELL WILSON SIGHTING!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GOHAWKS">#GOHAWKS</a> ¬†

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis is the first Die Hard film I was old enough to see at the theater.  No, it&#39;s not anywhere near as good as the first Die Hard (what is?), but I saw this at a Midnight screening after a Prince concert back in 2007, and after the high of that concert this was one of my favourite filmgoing experiences.  Yes, some of the set-pieces are very silly and it lacks the relative credibility of the first Die Hard or even Die Hard with a Vengeance, but this is still fun, the Willis and Justin Long interplay is highly enjoyable, and Timothy Olyphant is arguably the best Die Hard villain after the brilliant Alan Rickman (Jeremy Irons was good too, but I don&#39;t think he was quite as nasty as Rickman and Olyphant&#39;s characters).

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a steaming pile of propaganda bullshit disguised as an action flick. What a joke.

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaSoooo disappointing. You really think John will bring the hurt when its suggested that they have Lucy, his daughter. But NO. The movie falls so flat on its face it&#39;s embarrassing. It&#39;s like WTF am I watching?? It&#39;s John McClane. That&#39;s John McClane&#39;s daughter. Do you assholes know anything about the character or this franchise??
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard 1-4 are did very great pure 100% action thriller movies escapilly part 1 and 4 but Die Hard 5 what happened that! Why the filmmaker did this one like B- movie. The Fourth one was awesome. good casting, good script and storyline and good in the action scenes but Die Hard 5 oh no! John Moore I love you in your movie before in Behind Enemy Lines but this one was terrible movie. I love all of four Die Hard expect Die Hard 5 I hate it so much. I hope If Die Hard movie make the new one don&#39;t take John Moore to direct this legend film again. Only Len Wiseman and John McTiernan make this movie so great.

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis was the beginning of the end for R rated McClane films. PG-13 and another whiny comedy sidekick in tow with even more ludicrous stunts that could seriously injure a Terminator. It&#39;s still good compared to the fifth one but a bigger haul at the box office doesn&#39;t mean a better film, just greedy studio exes filling their boots while sanitizing an all time movie character icon.

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThe stunts in here were too over the top in this one
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI love this Die Hard because John McClane is at such a huge disadvantage, everything about this movie is technological and his knowledge of it is little to none. Plus, he gets the shit kicked out of him plenty and he pulls off some insane stunts. Although there were a few way over the top scenes, it was pretty good for the most part. Plus some of the humor in this movie is great.

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI remember this movie, I liked it. &quot;Yipee Ki-yay, mother(fucker),&quot; That was my favorite line of the movie, though I don&#39;t know if I spelled it right. It was a very good movie, it had Justin Long, and Kevin Smith too. Though I liked Justin Long in &quot;Waiting,&quot; better. I also think that Kevin Smith&#39;s &quot;Silent Bob&quot; is good also. I only remember him saying two words, &quot;No Ticket.&quot;
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThey used my high school in a part of the movie
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaBefore things got politically correct this franchise was good
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaIs this where kevin smith learned to hate bruce willis?
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitahe is kind of a vin diesel wanna be<br>Respect for bruce tho
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was good wouldve been better if rated R. Now part 5 was shit.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jz-8UcCiws&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> yipee ki yay not in the movie damn trailers !!!
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe this movie is almost 10 years old. Where did the time go?
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaS√©rgio Baranita Soares
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThe fact he said &quot;Killed&quot; a helicopter annoys me.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaomg why couldnt they kill justin long with a helicopter
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaHello good night could you tell me what cyber crimes committed in the movie please i need it
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis is still one of the best, if not THE best action movies I&#39;ve seen to this date.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitathis is one of the best die hards I&#39;ve seen I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI think if this movie was rated r much die hard fans would appreciate it more.Its such a underrated movie
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaEven though this movie doesnt have the r rated violence of the originals it captures the feel of die hard unlike die hard 5 which had an r rating but didnt have the feel of die hard
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaGood 4th of July movie.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie!! My favorite of all the die hard films! One thing I don&#39;t understand, is what exactly did John do to piss off his family so much
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitalove the die hard films.... wish they wouldn&#39;t of waited so long for another one . third best film in the series behind part 1 &amp; 2
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitabest DH sequel by far; better than 2 (same film as 1, just worse and on a different setting), than 3 (good action but horrible script) and 5 (unwatchable crap)<br>Die Hard 4 finds an older/bitter McClane in a crash course on new technologies, all while fighting against the most prepared-efficient villians yet (not very charismatic, though); good sidekick (and useful) and the kidnapped daughter was a nice update on the original &quot;wife held hostage&quot; concept
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaYou just killed a helicopter with a car! <br>I was out of bullets. <br>One of the  best action movie lines ever 
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshita1 &amp; 2 were excellent. I guess he just wanted to revisit the movie on 3 &amp; 4 they suck. Ôªø
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaA good day to die hard was so trash
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaBest Die Hard since the original. McClane was back to being a bad ass, real stunts, and who doesnt like an invincible John McClane. It&#39;s a movie, enjoy a throwback bad ass hero
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard deserved better than this.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitacan  someone  tell  me  the  name  of  the   music  at  0:53
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaHeart this movie
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI get why some people didn&#39;t like this die hard, but this is not a bad die hard,and the unrated cut is even better.  Yes this movie has a different feel and it should, John McClaine isn&#39;t the young guy that he was prior.  For a 4th movie taking place 12 years since the third, It was pretty well done.  The action, though at times over the top, was extremely entertaining and the story was engaging.  For all the haters watch die hard 5, and you will never complain about this one again. 
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitajust watched the movie, &amp; it was nice...
but, why did his wife left him after he saved her ass 2x??????
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshita2nd best die hard
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaOMG! June 27th is my birthday! Dang!
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThose were the days...
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad you agree!
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaLike your grammar? No, your grammar is in a league of it&#39;s own.

Live Free or Die Hard is not half as bad as people make it out to be.
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitasee the first one and you will think twice about that

8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaboth were terrible
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaDecent film. Terrible trailer!
8Jz-8UcCiwsdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life! &lt;3333333
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the title/artist of the song playing in the trailer?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaDallas Buyers Club director?¬†<br><br>SOLD.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaStupid
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome,¬†really like these kind of Movies.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this! Amazing and beautiful. Who doesn&#39;t eventually reach this stage at one point or another in their lives?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t read the book, but I&#39;m all about backpacking, so the movie better have lots of it.¬† I can take or leave the drama off the trail.¬† I&#39;m hopeful this is going to be good.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaThe book was phenomenal, so high hopes for this film. Beautiful trailer.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitagarden state much?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshita
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitafor some reason i had cowboys and horses and marriages that went wrong/sex lol<br>when i heard Wild + Reese<br>but i was wrong<br>this is a Emile Hirsch movie into the wild thingy<br>yet i&#39;m gonna givve it a chance cos i love Reese who knows<br>maybe it&#39;s the trailer that sucks ;)
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m incredibly excited for this film. I think it speaks to how amazing Cheryl Strayed&#39;s book was that Reese optioned the film rights before the book was even published. That also leads me to believe that she put her best effort into creating the character of Cheryl for the big screen. Truly an inspiring, challenging, heart warming, and sometimes tragic story and I recommend the book to anyone who hasn&#39;t read it.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaInto the Wild with Reese Witherspoon? Looks interesting :)
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhy am I living ?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI have a feeling this is going to be good! I smell an Oscar nomination for Reese Witherspoon!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhy are people saying &quot;she&#39;ll take any role she can get?&quot; Excuse me this is by an amazing director who got matthew and jared leto to win their first ever oscars and This movie looks as good. This is probably one of the best roles she&#39;s even got on.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaa female version of Aron Ralston
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaNice
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaAlmost done reading this book! It is so good. Cheryl Strayed is an amazing woman, and what she went through took a lot of strength and courage to become who she did. Hopefully they show that in the movie. ¬†Cant wait to see this.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaReese took a role from a best-selling book. Why are people here so confused about this?¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitato all these negativities out there...this is from the book &quot;wild&quot;, which is based on a true story and is about a woman who decides to walk a thousand miles on the pacific crest trail. I&#39;ve just finished the book and it was an awesome experience.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaThis looks good, I love Reese movies :) 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaOMG that&#39;s mendez from Orange is the New Black, did any OITNB fan noticed it too?!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI would have named this movie &quot;out there&quot;  Looks interesting!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaGod, what happened to her? 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaDef Oscar nomination
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaIf I could do anything differently then I would do almost everything differently. I&#39;ve stomped on hopes and dreams, physically and emotionally scarred people, lied, cheated etc. So have you. Anyone who wouldn&#39;t change anything because they are contempt with their current state of being is a selfish pig.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhy is everyone comparing this to into the wild? They&#39;re two completely different true stories based on completely different people. Nature is allowed to be significant in more than one person&#39;s life, its allowed to be the subject of more than one movie- it belongs to us all. Broaden yo minds.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaSimilar to Into the wild
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaSexsi vidio
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitadon keefer!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaLooks really pretentious.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaYes!

tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaReese Witherspoon ¬†is boring charisma-lacking actress
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitalooks like a great movie but i wouldnt have chosen reese witherspoon¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaProlly the best actress right now..¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI walk to the store everyday. It&#39;s a mile. Hot too. Shes&#39;s an animal. 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaThis is just into the wild female version
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a really good movie.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaIn to the wild, female version ???¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaCan you say Oscar Bait?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshita  Uso       .  
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaThis basically Into The Wild with a girl instead of a guy¬†

tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWatch &quot;Into the Wild&quot; instead
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaIs this the prequel to &quot;Into the Wild&quot;?¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaummm &quot;Into the wild&quot;...
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshita&quot;Reese Witherspoon wants an Oscar&quot;, coming soon.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaIf you like the look of this, you should check out a film called &#39;tracks&#39; with¬†Mia Wasikowska - really beautiful film set in Australia with a ¬†similar tone.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaRe, Fiston, retour √† la nature!!!; dernier film de Reese Witherspoon, superbe actrice, que j/irais voir tr√®s volontiers, bonne journ√©e, A+, PAPA.

tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaOscar written all over it. Happy for Reese!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhen your desperate and america has forgotton you as the terrible actor you are....you take any role you can get...thats why
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhen your desperate...take any roll you can get
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaInto the Wild, This movie will never surpass that master piece¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaInto the Wild 2
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaLoved the book by Cheryl Strayed.Waiting for the release to relive those moments visually.

tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitais this the femenist version of &quot;into the wild&quot;?

tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaname of song?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaUn bel trailer
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaJust looks like more pretentious Hollywood¬†bullsh*t¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitai love reese but she doesn&#39;t deserve an oscar, Felicity Huffman was just so amazing and give an oscar worthy performance in Transamerica :)
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaBeno√Æt de Spizona 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaAshland! &lt;3
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie with feminist bullshit at it&#39;s core.¬† Shame.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t ¬†know but I consider this gonna be another oscar nomination for Resse
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaFemale version of &quot;Into the Wild&quot;?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitabullshit.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaA self discovery film.  I smell an Oscar nominee. 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaI feel like a shitty cgi wolf would put an inexpungible mark on the movie.¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaReminds me of Eat Pray Love. Self-discovery journey
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaInteresting looking flick. I doubt it&#39;ll get much interest but could be good.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWHERE&#39;S THE MARLEY SHIRT?????¬†
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaShe filmed in ashland oregon where I reside and the streets were closed and I couldn&#39;t go to the liquor store for some magic juice...
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitasuch a talented actress looks like a good movie
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaHis looks so, so lovely. 
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song playing in the trailer?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaOSCARS HERE WE COME,,,!!!!!!
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaBeautifully shot. It looks like Reese really committed herself to this role.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaIts a book, a rather good book at that, &quot;Wild: Lost and Found on the Pacific Crest Trail&quot; by Cheryl Strayed.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWell this looks boring.
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s up, with Reese and these weird ass roles she been taking?
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitasuccccccck
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshita3rd
tn2-GSqPyl0delimeterByIshitaSo this is a female version of &quot;Into the Wild?&quot;¬† Let me guess, she dies of starvation at the end too?
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitai like cack
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaOmg this trailer is solid af. Truly represents the tone and core of the film. Even though it spoils the best part of this film
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaOkay this one is way better than the new movie hands down
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaTraumatic
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s easy to make a horror movie nowadays but this is truly one of a kind. The creep factor is on 1,000! The psychotic dialogue and torment from the killers, plus the fact that we never saw their faces! Still gives me the heeby jeebies! One of my all time faves!
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaYou can tell their liberals; they have no guns.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer was very weak in my opinion.. But both movies were fantastic
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen the movie it still is pretty terrifying and it is underrated as one of the scariest movies ever made
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitain gonna be honest. I sleep better at night with my gun next to me because of this movie lol 10 years later still
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWHOS HERE AFTER WATCHING THE STRANGERS 2 TRAILER??
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis is like rainbow six seige 2 v 3
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie itself was only decent, but seeing this trailer before Juno the entire audience gasped when the masked guy stepped out of the shadows at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a>.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this for the first time. I missed the beginning but I want to know WHY the masked people are after them. Can someone PLEASE tell me why because I was so confused watching it
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look scary I&#39;m only here because of the sequel I look forward to watching this
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaChe b movie , non si capisce un cazzo dall inizio alla fine.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaFinally part 2 is on it&#39;s way
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaCannot believe people can be so stupid. Leaving doors open or unlocked. Going off to buy cigarettes and leaving his girlfriend alone in the house. Opening the door at 4 am to a total stranger who knocks on the door. All in all rather silly.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWho else is here from no through road?
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> Hester Prynne
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI just realized every scene in the movie. The camera moves around, it&#39;s never steady
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaOh lovely, it&#39;s Tusk all over again. I was only trying to find the song but nope, just had to watch the trailer didn&#39;t you you idiot
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWhat a trailer!
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a total nonsense, bad guys have no motive, there is no explanation. At the end they remove their masks but we can&#39;t see their faces and frankly we don&#39;t care because no other characters are introduced. Save your time, watch starship troopers, again.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely one of the best horror movies that I see. An horror movie is better when the facts can happen in the real life.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> Thumbs up for Dennis Reynolds
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaMaybe I just wasn¬¥t in the right mood when I watched this movie - but I found it rather boring. We have seen storylines like these a fuckload of times in other movies already. It¬¥s not a bad movie - but if you want to see something you haven¬¥t seen before - then this is not the movie to go for in my opinion.<br>I would give the movie 4 out of 10
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is really well done 10/10 would recommend üëç
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitahow old is the age rating for this movie
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI was scared out of my mind of this movie. I had one eye closed the whole time. I will never live in the book dock country.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based on Charles Manson
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis was an okay movie.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaO M Güò®
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie. It fucken sucked. <br><br><br>If I were a married man and my wife and I are in a horrible dangerous crisis situation like this, last thing I would ever do is leave her all alone in a unsecured household while I run outside to look for a radio to call for help. <br><br><br>And another thing, if you are a friend and you&#39;re picking up someone and you can&#39;t get a hold of it by phone, what sense does it make to still walk inside the house alone when you see suspicious activity has occurred? Your friend&#39;s car was smashed up and lit on fire and the front door is wide open, why not just call the police when your cell phone actually works? <br><br><br>Dumbest horror movie ever
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitadef up there with on of the scariest movies ive seen.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaOne of the scariest I&#39;ve ever seen love it
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI watched this when I was like 11. Biggest mistake üò≠. Never have I been so afraid to be alone in my house.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie poster brought me here.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitabecause you were home üò≥
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t watch at night
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitathe record player music intensified the chills in the movie even more.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitamovie is so good
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaHonestly my favourite scene was the wide shot of her in the lounge room and one of the strangers just slowly walks into view and looks at her. It&#39;s so creepy and tense, and even though nothing happens in that moment and she doesn&#39;t see him it&#39;s just so CREEPY!
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s probably an Underrated Horror Film to say the least. I cannot wait for their Sequel this Year.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI came from Shane Dawson&#39;s recent video...
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t imagine people that went thru this in real life üò≠üò≠üò≠
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie with my best friend at the time when I was like anywhere from 9 to 11. (I&#39;m 18 now and too lazy to do the math)<br><br>Story:<br>It was me, my best friend, her parents, her two brothers, their friends, and one of their girlfriends. We also had a neighbor that was friends with my bff and I but we didn&#39;t really like her because of her attitude and how she always pushed us around. Well, she was crying in the kitchen because she didn&#39;t want to watch that movie. And they had already started the movie since before she got there. She ended up going into the bff&#39;s room and one of the brother&#39;s friends decided to go outside and hit the window to freak her out a bit. He slipped back into the room and acted like nothing happened and she went back into the kitchen. My bff&#39;s mom said, &quot;On the count of three, lets all scream.&quot; So that&#39;s exactly what we did and she finally went home (which was the house right beside hers). I felt bad, but it was also our revenge considering she was so rude to us.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie ever
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitame saw it at the movie theater
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaPLEASE BE CAREFULLY EVERYBODY BLESS U ALL AMENNN !!!!
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see it so bad but i&#39;m too young that&#39;s not the main reason it&#39;s because i believe this is based on real events and my parents say i can&#39;t get these images in my head, but i already did when i saw the cover
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaScared the fuck out of me
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaSuch scary
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitathis was the first video I ever watched on YouTube I&#39;m not kidding
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie No Bloody But its so scaryyy
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitawtf?? why do people say this is a good movie?? <br>- the two main characters did nothing except running and crying WTF?<br>- at the end the stupid director didnt even show us the face of killers WTF?!<br>DONT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH!!!<br>my rate: 0/10 üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitathe strangers 2?
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitathis film should have had more characters character development  but still a good film
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitai dont know why people think this movie is scary... i was mostly  laughing during this movie xD i did like it though it just wasnt scary
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI really don&#39;t know why some people like this movie T.T is freaking boring... Its like they killed those two just for the lolz. Im waiting for a plot twist but lol anyway this was based on a true story i don&#39;t like to see a sequel xD
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaive never understood why people split in horror moviesüòÇüòÇ
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitai saw this shit when i was seven i was fucking petrified
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaReally really well done film. Could&#39;ve been a little better. But one of the better recent horror films
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was inspired by the keddie cabin murders
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaSuch an amazing movie.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI remember my dad making me see this movie when i was 6 to me it wasn&#39;t scary at all
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaif that&#39;s not zooey deschannel&#39;s voice in the end ladies and gentlemen than I don&#39;t know what is
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaits sounds so sacry
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI watched this by myself in my room at night and honestly it was the scariest movie I&#39;ve ever seen
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based on the true story: the Keddie Murders.These murders took place in some kind of resort in California 1981, in April. There were two slaughtered bodies in the cabin, and the skull of a missing girl in the area. No one knows for sure who conducted these murders nor why. Two people(a middle aged man and woman) with glasses were suspects of the murders. <br>After the murders, people have claimed to hear strange noises in the cabin. Noises like moaning in irony or something. Then they burned down the cabin to the ground like in 2004. <br>The cabin&#39;s number was 28, and it was in a very remote area. No one heard the screams, noises or anything from the cabin. Modernly, the murder labyrinth is still unsolved, and considered one of the greatest murder mystery in history. They&#39;re probabyly still out there...waiting for another evident person to murder...
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaMark was right lol
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaTalk about one hell of an effective horror trailer.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a><br>Is that a sound effect from warcraft 3?
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaOh hell noooo ohhhhahhhh
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWhat if they were 3 black or latino guys thou üòÇüòÖ? They prolly wouldve been shot right on the spot ^_^
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was very gripping in the beginning and started in a manner much different from most horror movies. It built slowly, the actual story starting after over twenty minutes and from then onward, there were a lot of creepy moments.<br><br>For me, the movie started to get annoying when Kristen ran out of the house, fell on her face and injured her ankle. Cliche much? After that it was just a series of stupid decision and stupid decision like every other horror movie protagonist.<br>I realize why it has a 6.1/10 on IMDB.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaBest. Trailer. Ever.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWorse horror movie! No story 
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaone of the only movies that terrified me and my family
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaThey are making a second one based in a deserted trailer park!
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI love it 
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaWatched this alone in the cinema years ago. Sat right in front swear I shat my pants very intense. You never know what&#39;s gonna happen next not scary but definitely had me jumping when I least expected it 
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI ain&#39;t gonna open no door for no whore in the middle of the night when that bitch don&#39;t seem right especially with two other people outta sight. Three people trying to come into my home, cutting the lines to my phone and trying to end my wife and my life while they&#39;re only armed with knives. That&#39;s why I answer with a gun, I ain&#39;t gonna let them have any fun. Ain&#39;t gonna let them enter my house without a fee, maybe I should charge them 2 bullets each so six for all three.¬†<br>Just live by some rules and you won&#39;t die like a fool.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaStupid movie but it is based on a true story right? So I guess they only made the movie to what really happened. It&#39;s ridiculous that a couple in a house can&#39;t fight off TWO GIRLS and ONE GUY in mask with knives? It&#39;s like being robbed by a 10 year old with a knife. That would be the scariest robbery ever and be really hard to fight back. They have a house with a whole lot of things they can use as weapons, use all the knives in the kitchen as throwing knives, turn on the gas and fill up the house so once they walk in hold a lighter and tell those mofos &quot;If i&#39;m gonna die tonight i&#39;m taking you and your two hoes with me&quot;. Ohwells they couldn&#39;t fight so they died, survival of the fittest and I guess their instincts weren&#39;t fight or flight but run, hide and die.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI love the theme song
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitacreepy writing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbqELQHpmQM&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a>

BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI actually liked it. It has alot of originality to it
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaCrap film! not worth watching. so unrealistic.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaMint film<br>
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI heard this film is shite.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaI would run far away‚Ä¶
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitai would just play dead.
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit I would turn off all the lights and kill them in the dark
BbqELQHpmQMdelimeterByIshitaHoly s**t! If I was in that situation I would get like a ak-47 and take them down!

e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshitai wanna watch this!! lols...
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshita@Taps1995 Yes i am. In the Water Wizz part of this movie. When theyre at the water park. Met Adam Sandler, guys pretty cool
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshitathis movie shouldven been different plot and rated r
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like something Chris Farley would be in and that&#39;s a good thing.
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshita@SweetGehenna No you&#39;re not
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshita@joubert431 How you gonna tell me?
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshitaA lot of this movie was shot in Essex MA, which is quite near where I live. Many people who live nearby would run into Kevin James and Adam Sandler, as they would often be seen in restaurants in the surrounding area. From what I heard, Sandler and James were really nice to the fans that they met here. Apparently, those two great comedians are top notch decent people. By the way, this movie looks like it&#39;s going to be great.
e01NVCveGkgdelimeterByIshitaIm in this movie (:

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI used to watch a TV series like 11 years ago called Dark Shadows about vampires, it was great!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitashould of made it darker but hey i mean TIM BURTON, JOHNNY DEPP AND MICHELLE PFEIFFER, it can&#39;t be a bad film. michelle pfeiffer should of played snowwhite in snowwhite &amp; the huntsman 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaAs a fan of the original Dark Shadows series, a truly awesome Victorian gothic horror, I&#39;m very disappointed they turned this into a comedy
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWhat sorcery is this? *Tears out back of T.V. with haste* REVEAL YOURSELF! TINY SONGSTRESS! &gt;8U
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaThis is so going to fucking rock!!!! Who agrees with me on this??
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitathis really seems nothing like the original series...
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI saw this trailer while watching the hunger games.....
&lt;3
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitathe witch is like so pretty right!

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaF... Must watch ! 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve only heard about the original series but i think this might actually be the one time it comes across better!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter!! &lt;3 &lt;3 

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t listen to the haters!
This is gonna be a good movie! &lt;3
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWhy does tim burton only do emo/dark movies?

He ruined alice in wonderland.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaFuck Twilight, fuck your theory, fuck Tim Burton, fuck Johnny &#39;&#39;Midlife Crisis&#39;&#39; Depp.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaFuck your shit.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaAnd FUCK vampires!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaGod damn it not again, I am getting so fucking sick and tired of Tim Burton / Johnny Depp things. OHHH LET&#39;S RELEASE ANOTHER GRIM DARK FAIRYTAAALE OUHHH I CAN&#39;T ACCEPT THE FACT I AM HTTING 50 PLEASE CALL ME &#39;JOHNNY&#39; Hi I&#39;m Tim Burton I am desperate to maintain my image, watch my shitty generic BS movies!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaHolding out hope Tim Burton will maybe...finally...have a good movie after many years of crap.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaJonny Depp best ACTOR EVER got to agree!! The witch is also very pretty.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita1:15 for Convertible Plymouth Barracuda :D 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitathey have a room... it&#39;s called AWESOME.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaBarry White: You are the first, my last, my everything
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaMr &amp; Mss Dark! (Burton &amp; Depp)
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that starts in the minute 1:41  ??
please... answer me !
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaA good movie.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaahh, I cannot wait!! I&#39;m currently watching the old television show on netflix. :) I love Tim Burton , so its bound to be amazing!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaYes, all those other ones have homosexual parings.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a movie after my own heart. BTW, Depp and Michelle P. must have made some Dorian Grey type deal, they were in movies when I was in 1st grade, but they don&#39;t look old enough to be my parents.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaSong?
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaHelena Bonham Carter, is in this movie! OMG, Bellatrix! Whoo :D
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever! :D

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this !!!!!!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaalright from now on, if i see any movie details that involve johnny Depp, i will expect the movie to be directed or produced by Tim Burton and vice versa
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitalol Tim Burton and Johnny Depp makes the best movies together XD 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M TOTALLY GOING TO SEE THIS!!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song at 1:41? 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaThis was obviously filmed in digital. The cinematography looks bad.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita&quot;Are you stoned?&quot;
&quot;They tried stoning me, it didn&#39;t work.&quot;
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaFinally A vampire movie thats not Gay

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWeird
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWow, I actually don&#39;t know what to make of this.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI must have lost my sense of humor because I didn&#39;t find this funny.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me of the adam family 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@Lord6of9Uk What about Corpse bride? What about Sweeney Todd? Those were excellent films! You can&#39;t ignore those. 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaThis is exactly what we need. A vampire that doesn&#39;t sparkle and doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s stoned (lol not a reference to this movie) all the time. 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaa vampire that will not sparkle..
this will redeem the word vampire..

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitafinally a vampire love story worth of being called a Love Story..
fuck Twilight and their gay vampires..
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaso this is how cloe mortez became a vampire... lol
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita&quot;What sorcery is this !! REVEAL YOUR SELF TINY SONG-TRESS&quot; LMAOOO !! XD oh Johnny .. you are awesome ..

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s seem cute. :)
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaStill better than twilight. 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitastrange but interesting 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaThis is going be a crazy and entertaining film of Tim Burton since Sleepy Hollow.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaIs it safe to say depp and downey jr are this generations deniro and pacino
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI also like having sex on the ceiling
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaShit!!! the only descent collaboration of Timmy Burton and Johnny Deppedy is Sleepy fucken Holloooww. end of.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitafuck
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaEvery thing Johnny touches turns to gold
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaEvery thing johnny touvhes turns yo gold
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaOh Johnny, What have you just done.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitawhen i looked at the pic of the video i thought it was that gay teen zombie movie. then i saw it was tim burton and johnny depp. i love the movies that they do together, they all make me laugh uncontrollably
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@Mr54M 
Careful. Youtube doesn&#39;t take kindly to critics...
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@TEKITOcreations 
So why don&#39;t they suck? Because you&#39;re willing to accept anything? Because you have no standards? Because you laugh at how terrible they are?
I have objective reasons for disliking today&#39;s films. 
What are your reasons for liking them? Just because?
How close minded and silly.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitacurse Johnny Depp for being funny!!!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaUtterly crap, that&#39;s what it looks like.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@bloodrunsclear Oh look, another wanna be movie buff who think they have better taste than everybody else because they don&#39;t have the same generic and silly complaints. I&#39;m sorry, but the complaint that &quot;all movies suck&quot; these days&#39; is closed minded and pretty silly imho.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@MorningsideTV Wouldn&#39;t it be more unimaginative if they just made the movie an exact carbon copy of the original show? Changing things up is not a sign of laziness. It&#39;s what they have to do to make this movie modern and have a greater appeal. This movie is based on a soap opera, which in of itself is melodramatic, so a humorous approach is not that odd. It certainly didn&#39;t the 21 Jump Street remake.    
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@dxfroscot45 :D the movie sucks indeed
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitajohnny depp?!!.... yes ofc. 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaEva Green &lt;3 !!

N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitais it michelle pfeiffer in it? GREAT!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! XD I can&#39;t wait!! &lt;3
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitahaahahahhha this is awesome!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@dxfroscot45 
Me too.
But then again movies have sucked for so long people will accept this movie as good by now.
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaI sort of wish this took place in another time period, but this still looks good. 
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@ChromicGfx That&#39;s absolutely perfect!
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWTF
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshita@dxfroscot45 ONLY you
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitaWho thinks the movie&#39;s gonna suck???
N6tVdffCr_MdelimeterByIshitacool
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshita&quot;You can&#39;t afford me.&quot;<br>An rdj classic. Lol love that man!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLooks like a somewhat smart movie ,the type hollywood doesn&#39;t make often, I wouldn&#39;t mind driving to the theater &amp; spend my $ on a ticket for this
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaSomething&#39;s wrong when Vincent D&#39;Onofrio looks the same age as Robert Duvall
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaI am waiting for the punchline..¬†
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaCould be good. Could be formulaic and sappy.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaOh Man! This is goin&#39; to be great!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaI smell an Oscarrr! :)
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaGreat to see Downey in a non marvel role..
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaOscar nominated movie! Oct. Release date? Oh yeah most definitely 
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaCan I just gush over how HAPPY I am for David Krumholtz right now? He has always been my most favorite actor and this role might be the one that gets him the recognition he deserves. It is kinda weird how awkward Tony Stark is being in this movie tho.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaRobert Downey, Jr. is the best!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitai&#39;m not a big fan of drama and stuff but i&#39;m going to watch this movie anw just for robert dawney jr :)
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitawell he is a lawyer this time not Tony Stark!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaWow, this looks really good, and that cast! This has Oscar written all over it!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLooks good
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLooks good
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks good
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitawow looking forward.....<br>Heavy cast.....<br>RDJ looking classic.....love him
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLooks great 
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaGive the people a former stone cold lawyer turned soft after his mother&#39;s death and everybody is screaming for an Oscar. I should start writing scripts for Hollywood, because they sure have a limited amount of stories and characters.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaNow this!<br>This looks promising!
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaThat cast doe
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaTony Stark still drunk as fuck, thinks he is a lawyer and shit...
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaNice to see robert getting to his roots I love iron man and tony stark but I love robert when he dosent play a narcissist. 
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaThe academy better nominate him for this......
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaWish they did overdo this trailer.¬†
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBvK6ni97W8&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> Metallica T-shirt
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLooks good I really like duval (sp?)
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaIs this a movie about an accused judge or a teen angst, book to film adaptation. Worst score for a film like this thereby making the actors look very manilla rather than firm. Not a good trailer.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaLorne Malvo FTW.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaRDJ..&lt;3.&lt;3
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaIs Downey going to wear a Metal band shirt in most of his movie ?<br><br>I&#39;m fine with that.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaWill someone give this man a damn Oscar...based on this trailer alone...
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaSposami.
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitawait what? did iron man quit his job ?
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaGotta love Rdj‚ô•
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaPerfectooooooo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• robert downey te amo <br>Duckling ‚ô•
ZBvK6ni97W8delimeterByIshitaAye people keep forgetting that Downey Jnr is more than just a one Character Actor! (hence the Tony Starkisms)  but he WILL be back as Stark! in both Age Of Ultron &amp; Iron Man 4

VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@Jasumi I&#39;m a christian too , myself , but i can&#39;t take any of the religious bullshit as true and believable :)
Sorry if i often people by saying that , but there&#39;s a looot of absurdities in the line of religion , sadly :(

VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@alexpanait Because he/she is a christian, I take it? It&#39;s not like wranger called you personally a &quot;fudgepacker&quot; or something. Tired of seeing all this hate on youtube...
VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@Jasumi No offence meant , but he should have replied if he felt disturbed by my post ! 
On a 2nd thought - take a good look at his post and decide whether he was worth the effort of defending him or not :)
I&#39;d say it&#39;s not....it&#39;s just a waste of time and patience
VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@alexpanait Really? And calling someone a douchebag for having an opinion is perfectly fine? 
VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@Jasumi No i ain&#39;t , but i&#39;m hoping you enjoy your time there , in the deep depths of hell itself :)
Calling someone you don&#39;t know names is a faggety-purpose so...enjoy your miserable life :)
VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshita@TheAlyssamoss yeah im guessing that too
VzXg-Vr1sMAdelimeterByIshitathis is kinda just like... no strings attached?

ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaRule Britannia
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaIs people really dumb to not understand the story or they just want to act dumb to blame middle east? Everyone with a little brain knows, that US created terrorists and Europe supports US. Al qaida, Taliban, Isis.... all of them are trained by US.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaLooks like typical dull, stiff and boring British acting.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI have a big crush on Julia stiles so even if this movie is shit it will still get 100 percent from me
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the attorney General is eating for breakfast at the ending of the movie when he is explaining the likely outcome of the case?
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI think its a good movie
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitavery good¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaItayfaak, considence¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaInter arma enim silent leges.( cicero) ..the age old cry of the oppressor
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaYeah........ that&#39;s idd boring.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaanother movie added to my watch-list!
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitabulgarien plezzz
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaStraight illuminati 
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaIt has similar storyline as Princess Di assassination.. in a bit different context, but same cover-up.. nice work MI5-6 (to clarify this is Sarcastic notion..)
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaawesomeeee
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshita¬†Rebecca Hall is lovely! in this. Story is good. liked it. Very practical.¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaRotten Tomatoes ranks this at 40%, with an overall consensus that seems to be more confused than definitive, praising it for being slick and well acted but not quite good enough.<br><br>Honestly... Closed Circuit is a movie that carries a great spy vibe to it. This is in part because it is a thriller but also in part to some of the plots characters. Bana and Hall are average at best, i mean its no Munich...thats for sure. But i found myself more approving of Bana than Hall, but thats just favoritism. Cirian Hinds has a nice minor supporting role as well as Broadbent, but ultimately are not enough to bring the movie home.<br>It has a great plot, it has great thriller elements to it, its suspenseful and somewhat plausible but i think what really hampers this film is its abrupt stop.<br>There is a point in the film, about a quarter of the way through, where one character mentions something that if it were enacted in the film, could easily stop the movie in its tracks, but for our sake allows it to continue on right up untill the climax.<br>when said event finally does take place you feel sort of duped. In a sense it was as if the movie told us the multiple ways it could end and the for some reason chose the least interesting way for it to end.<br>It is for sure worth a redbox at the least. check it out
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitayou all missed the point, this shows that it was not the middle east guy that did it but the government entrapping him, and they¬† are getting to close to the truth and that is why they are running for their life! but yeh its fear mongering like people say, people will not kill other people if they knew that they just want to be left alone! its the leaders that push people to war! and they never fight it! we should tell them if they want war to go and fight them!¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaquite booring. watch it only if u like this kind of movies
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI am looking for a british movie where a pakistani girl was forced marriage in pakistani and she runs away &amp; joins some terrorist group and like in the end she blows up at a public place in london. I watched this movie in 2009 &amp; forgot its name ever since i searched it but couldn&#39;t find...<br>if any1 knows...pls leave me a msg..thnx
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sick of seeing terrorist story about middle-east people and US.....
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of actress in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktiMVKeA9QM&amp;t=00m45s">00:45</a> :p

ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaYIFY¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie isn&#39;t good, but¬†what ruined it the most is the ending. The ending sucked really really bad.¬†
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitais it just me or is this a low budget movie which I don&#39;t need to see?
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaNice movie,with lots of Western &quot;democracy&quot; methods.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t about you guys but to me this feels like a spin off or side story of The Bourne Indentity haha
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaPersonal opinion don&#39;t need to care about it, but I think this movie was to damn long and horrible ending meh.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitamore fear mongering
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI just watched the Beginning and the End, give me one Reason to Watch the Movie now! :)
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitawatch chopper its eric banas best movie
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaeric bana is great. he lifts the movie with his acting
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t need to see the movie now.
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitamovies sucks but Rebecca Hall is awesome as always..
ktiMVKeA9QMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so fucking paranoid I just shit a CCTV camera

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaE&#39; lo spettro del potere, quale esso sia radicato. L&#39;Austria, l&#39;Ungheria e la Cecoslovacchia sono la culla della teosofia con le sue liturgie. Ma poi la teosofia si radic√≤ in usa con george whashington e in uk col museo delle cere di madame trouffot e il mesmerismo. L&#39;italia fino ad ora fu colpita con lo zodiaco e il ponte del diavolo, ma ora sar√° colpita di pi√∫. Il principio √© semplice, tutto ci√≥ che non √© Vita, √© uno specchio della vita e lo specchio ha da subito un costo. Anche essere molto ricchi ha un costo, se la vita non √© altrettanto ricca. Tutto ha un costo. E&#39; la regola.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThat is one great trailer.... for one great film.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIt was a good movie, but it was predictable
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaAnyone noticed tha old man and doctor,...
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie!<br>The thing is, there was an &quot;illusion&quot; we all believed in but it is only revealed in the end.<br>Great story.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThis is one outstanding movie, great writing and fantastic cast of characters too
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is one of my favorites
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaWatching this movie almost ever year since it was out. A masterpiece. ‚ú®üëç
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaMuch better than that overrated The Prestige.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies!!! My first watch I was 11-12 and became hypnotized by the characters and the story üíú Edward was probably one of my first crushes ü•≤
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe Illusionist my best by far with all the appeal of a handsome sexy Edward Norton.  See him Pride and Glory.  Wow!!! What gritty handsome cop!!!  Excellent acting.  I can say so much, but I won&#39;t.  The mustache and beard knocks me out - superb acting Edward.

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI was pretty disappointed in this movie, but maybe I&#39;d like it a lot more if I give it another shot. That being said, this trailer is trash lol
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe Illusionist (2006) should be watched with The Prestige (2006).
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve always enjoyed what magicians can do &amp; though i have had plenty of chances to see how these illusions have been done them i prefer not to know as your spoiling the whole object of what the magician is doing &amp; thats trying to entertain you all the while you are left to try &amp; figure out how those tricks were done...<br><br>I &amp; 2 of my friends went to see a scottish mentalist who could hypnotize those who were susceptible to this &amp; i&#39;ll stress that it was the audience complete choice to take part in this as you had to clasp your hands together &amp; after he said what he wanted &amp; you if couldn&#39;t separate your hands this showed you were susceptible to being hypnotized &amp; even then you didnt need to participate unless you wanted to as once he had his volunteers as if by magic your hands were now free &amp; i&#39;ll also point out that you had the option to not even clasps your hands &amp; therefore you weren&#39;t forced into doing this whatsoever &amp; it was completely up to those audience members if they wanted to participate or not at every opportunity...<br><br>If you havent gone to a show like this i recommend doing so as your have one hell of a laugh at the comical antics taking place on stage by volunteers from the audience...<br><br>That aside i always preferred &quot; The Illusionist &quot; to &quot; The Prestige &quot; &amp; though both had great actor&#39;s who put convincing performances i preferred this film because the overall narrative was more compelling &amp; to me had the better overall story...<br><br>If you haven&#39;t watched them or you&#39;ve only watched one of them then i recommend watching both &amp; then make up your own opinion as to what movie you liked the best...<br><br>In light of this still ongoing coronavirus stay safe &amp; healthy wherever you are in this world...<br><br><br>.....<br><br>He played to a packed audience everytime he went on tour &amp; it wasn&#39;t until i spotted another group of my friends at the same show that i wondered if any of them would participate &amp; 1 of my friends did...<br><br>This was a man like myself who wasnt open to these things &amp; therefore didn&#39;t have the usual attitude that its staged but hes also like myself in that he wouldnt willingly go up on stage &amp; kid on that he was hypnotized...<br><br>What i can tell you is he went up on stage with other member&#39;s of the audience &amp; i sat there &amp; watched my friend do things he wouldnt do for a laugh if he was drunk &amp; we left that show later on in absolute stitches as we couldnt stop laughing at how this mentalist managed to make these people perform such hilarious acts at his request &amp; all those who took part were given free tickets to back &amp; watched the show just as a viewer as they missed it because they were the show &amp; couldnt remember anything...

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI can sense the smell of a gret movie just watching his trailer and now I will watch it
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshita2020..???
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just a friggin advert. Not Illusion but a Con!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitahere in 2020
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaHaving watched the film, it&#39;s funny to see how the guy was right all along and they are indeed proved to be a bunch of foolish incompetents, while the bitch pretending to be victim all along was in fact the biggest villain that faked everything and planted falsified evidence with malice forethought so that the illusionist could play his biggest illusion on himself... that illusionist is gonna have to sleep on the bed he&#39;s made for himself and he&#39;s in for a rude disillusion now.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaW                 O                             W            MOVIE IS GREAT !

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI guess this is the movie that I watched years ago with my sister at night. Never finished it cause I fell asleep, but it&#39;s been at the back of my mind all these &amp; I now know the name
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe pianist... The illusionist... Perfume...  what will you suggest the fourth one?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIs fucking awesome movie üòçüëå
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaPrestige &gt; Whatever this movie claims to be.. it&#39;s just some sappy stupid love story between two people who had no chemistry.. with a small side of magic that&#39;s really just CGI lol
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitasorry this is a shit movie.. Go watch The Prestige instead.. one of my favorites
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaWho else here noticed Eisenheim were a combination of both names of Heisenberg + Oppenheimer = two scientists rivals that raced to create the first atomic bomb???
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshita2019?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaPrestige has more logic but illusionist has great story

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI HAVE SOMETHING COMPLETELY SEPARATE TO SAY INVOLVING ACTOR STAR (EDWARD NORTON)<br><br>Now I heard that actor (Edward Norton) had run into trouble when it comes to no longer being allowed to act in anymore (MARVEL) movies; That is after a few intense situations had happened behind a small number of scenes of in the making of a few movies after (The Incredible Hulk)movie.<br><br><br>But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it might not be out of the question for (Edward Norton) to be allowed to act in any (DC ComicBook) movies character roles; An so I strongly think that he should deserve the right to be given the chance to try out in acting in playing a character role in a future movie project.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI was in Las Vegas , staying at the Plaza while I was being followed . I had a ticket for a rock show but it was cancelled . So I went to a comedy show instead . I walked into the shop and saw my movie poster , mocking me.

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI have seen this movie like 20 times and I love it so much.  Should I see The prestige?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe Prestige: I have an army of Batman and Wolverine<br>The Illusionist: We have a HULK. <br>                             Do not f**k with us because <br>                             In Tyler, we trust
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe Prestige: &quot;I have Batman and the Wolverine&quot;<br>The Illusionist: &quot;We have a Hulk&quot;
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie. It was surprisingly historically accurate language-wise. I&#39;m czech and I speak a bit of german and the accents were pretty decent. Subtle, not over the top, just right. I even noticed a random guy in Vienna at Eisenheim&#39;s arrest yelling in a czech accent. Not sure if intentional, or if the actor just rolled the &#39;R&#39;s too much for the accent to sound austrian-german, but historically plausible nonetheless as what whould later become the Czech republic was part of the Austrian-hungarian empire.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaTo whom it may concern,<br>If you are someone like myself, Scrolling through one of many directories of movies offered by a popular service, Perhaps Netflix, Or maybe Amazon Prime, And now you&#39;ve come to see the trailer here on YouTube to see if this is a movie you want to watch, Please read this.<br>You MUST watch this movie, Do not let this poor trailer convince you otherwise, It does not serve the movie justice. Yes the movie is 12 years old, But Im telling you, It feels like it could have came out today, And still be a hit. It&#39;s a beautiful piece, And i feel even if this message convinces a single person to watch this movie who might not have because they thought the trailer was a accurate representation, Ill have satisfaction. Im a avid movie lover, And after finding this, Im so glad i didn&#39;t skip over it because of the trailer, Which i have done many times before. <br>Please just click play, You will not regret it.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaprestige or this
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitathis movie is FANTASTIC I highly recoment to watch it. 5/5
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie!!

i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitathe trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaLoved the Prestige so saw this right after and was completely disappointed. Didn&#39;t connect to the characters at all in this and guessed the &quot;twist&quot; right away.  Such a let down
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaDerrick rose&#39;s favorite movie haha
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshita2018?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitabehold ! the magic show !
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton Edward Norton Edward Nortooooon!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaüëçüëçnice
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a masterpiece by Christopher nolan! Wait! What!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only here for Ed Norton
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshita&quot;The Illusionist&quot; - Incredible cinematography creates a big screen experience even on your home TV. Beautifully tricked-up film about a fantastic trickster.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaNolan would have made it 10x better
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitathe best movie
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitai like both...
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshita...and in the end it was all just an ILLUSION!!!!  Well, except for the innocent guy they put in jail, oh and the Prince shooting himself in the head, but aside from those minor details.. just and ILLUSION!!!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaMy only question of this movie is why did they not show how the ghost trick works?<br>By the way this movie is good.,, but THE PRESTIGE is way better.,,
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t realize that this story was built around a fictionalized version of a real incident (there really was an Austrian crown prince who killed his lover and then killed himself, although his name was not Leopold).  Kudos to the original story writer and screenwriters who took an obscure historical incident and made a very entertaining story/film out of it!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIf you liked this watch a film called The Prestige by Christopher Nolan. Great film.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI watched the moive and I really loved it... Can anyone recommend me this type of great moives..plz.. I love the genre of mystery and thriller..
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI watched the full movie  and I rate  7/10 .  not bad .good movie.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t understand how he done <br>Can anybody say plz
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaExcellent movie! A must see!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI love Ed Norton but this beard really looks sharpied on his chin...
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI so loved that movie! Just discovered it about 10 years after its release. The way the tricks were presented made me feel like i was watching a stage show and i really enjoyed it, felt entranced, fully absorbed in the enchantment. What i like about this movie is that people, who love to enjoy magic for the sake of it, will feel the pure sense of fascination, and people, who want to find out the trick, lift the enchantment, will find out. It works in both directions, because it never claimed to be real magic, but an illusion.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitashit trailer, great movie.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaMINDFREAK
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI have seen the Illusionist and I am interested in magic.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t know why but seeing thinks makes me think of Edward Norton as Dr strange
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThis is on my list as one of the best movies ever.  The trailer does not even measure to the quality of the film.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI honestly think that this was more like the prestige, and amazed they were released the same year. Downloading... :D
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIt is pretty crazy back in those less enlightened era, when they arrested an illusionist for raising a few souls from the dead. Go back a few more centuries they probably burn you at the steak in witch trials for something like that.<br>It&#39;s just an &quot;illusion&quot;, I think u need an permit or something??<br>&gt;.&gt;<br>&lt;.&lt;
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaIt was so inspiring to me, When I was a teen and drowned in jugglery world.<br>well now I&#39;m not a Juggler! but this movie will always be in my mind ...
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitai saw the movie an d ...... WOW it was awesome<br>a big clap to the director
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaSorry, what does this have to do with the Mayerling Incident?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaA classic magic movie. One of my favorites!!! &lt;3
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies!
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI like both Prestige and this.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe mind is its own place, and by itself can turn fried chicken into ecstasy.
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaFind it very interesting that this an &quot;The Prestige&quot; came out in the same year!!<br>who copied who?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve always loved this movie ;u;
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaWorth watching?
i0xO64icGSYdelimeterByIshitaThe Prestige was much better...

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaA decade ago, an elite commando unit was sent to prison for a crime they didn&#39;t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security facility. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers for hire. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire.... the A-Team.

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaAll that bullshit, and not one shot of Biel in a bikini!......luckily Netflix has provided me with Sinners.
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaLove that Civic &lt;3
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaYou have violated the name of the original show!

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitastupid and shitty movie
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaif anyone was wodnerign about da song in the beggining of the movie,

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaI hate it when trailers have so many fade to blacks. it makes me feel like im blinking involuntarily
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitathe series was better
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitathere not being chased by col. lynch, not by col. decker, not by gen. fullbright.
&quot;lynch&quot; is now cia??
B.A. becomes a pacifist??????
i like the movie but, there&#39;s a lot of differance between the movie and the series.. 
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaTHAT WAS ONE AWSOME EPIC MOVIE!!!
though my mom ruin it for calling in the cell in the best part :P
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is fun and Murdoc is hilarious.  Jump starting a car with a defibrillator cracked me up.

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell are you guys on? how stupid would it be if they used mr-t as the only original menber???? he would look too old in conparison with the rest of the cast, hes like 60, u guys are not making any sense.
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaSometimes these re-workings of original TV shows work, when attempted as big-screen flicks 20 yrs later. SOMETIMES NOT !!  The weekly plots &amp; the underlying premise of this entire original TV Series were paper-thin, at best.  And so .. sorry to say .. I don&#39;t think this sleazy opportunistic re-work of the 1980s TV Show isn&#39;t going to cut it ...
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaso how come his name isnt Mr T anymore?
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaanyone else think 50 should have been B.A.? Was he even considered?
exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitaiam not sure if i like the new Mr T .

exyzEFrmLuMdelimeterByIshitayou don&#39;t think the movie world has to move with the times ?

fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaGod is so great
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaoh you people don&#39;t make this type movies. Noah (as) he is a messenger of Allah
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI hope Hollywood will make a faith-based movie from the book Paradise Lost by John Milton.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaCeritanya di ambil dari cerita nabi nuh
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just a movie guys...just enjoy the movie
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaSince this was mankind‚Äôs first deviation from the correct worship of God as taught by Prophet Adam, God, in his infinite Kindness and Mercy, fulfilled His promise to Adam to send messengers as guidance for mankind.  God sent Noah(Nuh), the first of His Messengers.[4]  Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad said:<br><br>‚ÄúOn the day of Judgement, the people will come to Noah and say ‚ÄòOh Noah, you are the first of the Messengers sent to earth, and God called you a thankful slave.‚Äô‚Äù(Saheeh Al-Bukhari)<br><br>Worshipping anything other than God has grave consequences, the least of which is a lack of freedom; for Satan enslaves man, destroys his mind and renders him unable to distinguish between right and wrong.  When Noah warned his people of the torment that awaited them if they did not give up their idolatry, his warning fell mostly on deaf ears.  Noah explained Satan‚Äôs deceit, but his people turned away and refused to listen.  Noah warned them day and night; he announced his message in public and he spoke quietly to people privately; yet all, but a few, denied his words.  Noah cried out to God.<br><br>‚ÄúHe said: ‚ÄòO my Lord!  Verily, I have called my people night and day (secretly and openly to accept the doctrine of Islamic Monotheism), but all my calling added nothing but to their flight from the truth.  Verily!  Every time I called unto them that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, and persisted (in their refusal), and magnified themselves in pride.‚Äù (Quran 71:5-7)<br><br>Those who responded to Noah‚Äôs call were the weakest and poorest of his people; the leaders and those with power responded arrogantly and rejected the call.  They said:<br><br>‚ÄúVerily we see you in plain error‚Äù (Quran 7:60)<br><br>Noah continued to appeal to his people, day after day and year after year.

fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaThey  don&#39;t look like Semitic people from South west Asia ( Middle East). Is this telling set in ancient Europe ? Lol.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorites. Totally misunderstood.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaAre u really think it is same what God told us in the Holy Quran or Holy Bible.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s fake story
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaFor they deliberately ignore this fact, that long ago there were heavens and an earth standing firmly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God;+ 6  and that by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was flooded with water.+ 7  But by the same word the heavens and the earth that now exist are reserved for fire and are being kept until the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly people.+<br>8  However, do not let this escape your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah* as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.+ 9  Jehovah* is not slow concerning his promise,+ as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.<br><br>(2 Peter 3:5 / Galatians <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdu10cX3pWA&amp;t=5m19s">5:19</a> thru 26 / Romans <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdu10cX3pWA&amp;t=7m24s">7:24</a>/John <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdu10cX3pWA&amp;t=3m16s">3:16</a>)<br><br><a href="https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/bible-teach/#?insight[search_id]=328dcb0b-0d60-48ac-a40a-e53d9a7098fc&amp;insight[search_result_index]=3">https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/bible-teach/#?insight[search_id]=328dcb0b-0d60-48ac-a40a-e53d9a7098fc&amp;insight[search_result_index]=3</a>
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaits Prophet Nuh üò°
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitawe all knew this was not the biblical version, Hollywood has to have its 2 cents thrown in it, only thing is that they threw 99 cents instead...
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaThey said: &quot;O Noah! Thou hast disputed with us, and you have the dispute with us, therefore bring to us what you threaten us, if what you say is true. <br><br>And Noah began to make the ark. And every time the leader of his people passed by him, they mocked him. He said: &quot;If ye ridicule us, then indeed we (were) mock you as you all mock (us).<br><br>Verse Hud : 32-38
-----------------------------------------<br>And it sailed with them in waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son was in a far-flung: &quot;My son, take (the ship) with us and be not with the disbelievers.&quot; He said: &quot;I will seek refuge in the mountain that will save me from the water&quot;. He said: &quot;There is no protector today from the command of Allah (Alone), the All-Merciful&quot;. And the waves came between them; and the son was among those who drowned.<br><br>Verse Hud: 42-43
-----------------------------------------<br><br>But We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. <br><br>Verse Asy-Shu&#39;ara: 119<br>-----------------------------------------<br>So we saved him and the passengers on the ark, and we make it a lesson for all mankind.<br><br>Verse Al-Ankabut: 15
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaWe sent Noah to his people and he said: &quot;O my people! Ye have no other god but Him.&quot; Indeed (if you do not worship Allah), I fear for you the torment of a Great Day (of Judgment) , The chieftains of his people said: &quot;Verily, we see you in clear error.&quot; He said: &quot;O my people, there is no error in me, but I am a messenger of the Lord of hosts.&quot; &quot;I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and give good advice, and I know from Allah what you know not.&quot; And if you (do not believe) and wonder that come to you from your Lord through a man from amongst you, that he may warn you and that you may be cautious, and that you may receive mercy? But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ark, and We drowned those who denied Our revelations. They were indeed a blind (wander).<br><br>Verse Al-A&#39;raf : 59-64
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitagoing back on his promise now.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaIts amazing how¬†this 500 year old man¬†got 7 million animals¬† on a small boat all made by himself ....while god was killing all those innocent young children and mothers with a flood...
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshita&quot;The thing that&#39;s disturbing about the Noah story is not that it&#39;s silly, it&#39;s immoral! It&#39;s about a psychotic mass-murderer who gets away with it, and his name is God.&quot;<br><br>-Bill Maher
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitanice movie
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI was born a christian and am now an atheist, I enjoyed the movie when I watched it some time ago. This is entertainment, i did not see any disclaimer saying its based on what bible or any other book says so calm your tits people. When it comes to movies I believe you should just go ahead and watch whatever you want instead of listening to others. Many of the movies, also underrated ones were actually pretty amazing even though some people told me they were not.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaA unica coisa legal do filme foi a emma
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaYou know, just because it doesn&#39;t follow the Bible completely, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. I haven&#39;t watched it myself yet, but I believe in not having prejudices. Also, even though I&#39;m Christian, it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t be satisfied watching a non biblical (correct) movie.. Get over yourselves, it&#39;s just a movie.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitawawawawawa
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitahahahaha fuckin jerks
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaThe film insulting Islam
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitathe film is badly
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaGod can&#39;t make anything right. LOL<br>God&#39;s Ctrl+Alt+Del fails again and again.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t give a shit if people say it&#39;s a bad move because it doesn&#39;t follow the bible
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitajangan ditonton filmnya menghina nabi nuh alaihisalam!
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitafor people who don&#39;t get it ==&gt; this movie is to christians what the new &quot;Jem and the hologramms&quot; is to the fans of the old cartoon : a pile of donk
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI was so close to paying $26.00 to see this in Gold Class but after watching the BluRay and seeing those rock monsters and how unevenly passed the movie was I&#39;m glad I saw something else.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI noticed they left out the stone creatures/ transformers, cuz they know nobody would have gone to see it, those ridiculous stone creatures killed this movie and what&#39;s will Russell crowes buzz cut and beard look, come on Noah with a stylish buzz cut? This movie pretty much sucked, did anyone even see Robin Hood? Russel Crowe is a liability to any movie he&#39;s in, he&#39;s not bankable anymore.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaFolks, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM;¬† this movie goes way against Biblical belief, faith and understanding. I went into this movie wanting to believe it was an updated version, of the life and times of one the greatest men who walked the earth. Instead, it was used to try and¬† completely confuse the average person. With no real reference to the one and only GOD, and Jesus Christ. I would not recommend this movie at all.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaHollywood is going to far. It&#39;s trying to  rewrite the bible to its own image of lies. 
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitahabe den film eben gesehen, meiner meinung zwar gute schauspieler, aber der film / die story bzw. die geschichte von noah und seiner arche ist vollich √ºberzogen dargestellt und ist auch irgendwie voll verwirrend, irgendwelche unrealistischen steinmonster, die nichtmal so gut animiert sind, das zerst√∂rt irgendwie den film. Schade hatte mich so darauf gefreut :/
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaYour story completely not true
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaNew bullshit to support old bullshit?? Niiiice!
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitawhoever doesnt like this could literally go to hell. XD
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaIn the beginning there was adam and eve. They had 2 sons kain and abel... Then kain and abel got married... Because apparently women just appeared out of thin air in the bible. How the hell did they get married? Lol
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was different from the way I pictured it.   BUT NO MATTER  WHAT I STILL BELIEVE!!! IN GOD.  AND THE STORY OF  Noah and the bible version!!!  D.K.   
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure exactly what I expected, but I sure as hell didn&#39;t expect something that entertaining! The Fountain, but with rock monsters and Crowe kicking ass with an axe!
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaOnce again I question the acceptance of incest during those days cause look, if we all started from one man and one woman (Adam &amp; Eve), some how some way, son+mom, dad+daughter, incest upon incest and fucked up genetics!!!<br><br>So, then we reach yet ANOTHER genetic &quot;bottleneck&quot; with Noah cause if there&#39;s only his family left, and now there&#39;s billions....umm....you do the math!! icky
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaWhat is music names?
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshita(Gladiator Voice):¬†You can call me Noah, and I will save these animals in this life or the next.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaThere should be a fiction label on this movie¬†
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaYes, commit mass genocide to stamp out the human nature he supposedly gave us. God is either really stupid or a complete asshole. I think both.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaNever mind the pointless religious debate. Lets just focus on the movie for now.¬†<br>IT WAS PURE SHITE!!!
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitathe christians wanted to ban Harry Potter because the children are being taught witch craft. <br><br>the christians/jews also claim this movie did not match the actual story from their bible/torah. meanwhile the christian and jews are arguing that their story is the actual account.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaI had such high hopes for this movie, the trailer seemed amazing indeed. Unfortunately the movie itself was utter garbage overall and also contains a major subliminal evil feature.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshita
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaGod took 2 animals of each species and put them on a boat. It said that in the Quran
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaEvan Almighty. Anyone?¬†
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaAll land was one mass.  The flood, the earth opened up and released all water and rain fell. Science has proved this with drilling.  Also they have proved the shift in land.  It also proves why people don&#39;t live 200+ years since the the environment changed at that point.  So why is it impossible to have happened.  They found the ark.  Do your research before you make yourself look foolish.

fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaHow funny , these so called &quot;Christians&quot; and their fairy tales. The foolish idea that 2 of every animal in the entire world could fit on one single hand made boat is completely ILLOGICAL, let alone IMPOSSIBLE. How did the animals get there ? The sloths ? Did they swim all the way across the ocean from Australia ? What about the insects ??? There are no details , just lies on top of lies. What a bullshit story. for fucks sake , I&#39;ve read children&#39;s story&#39;s that make more sense than this fairy tale does. Anyone who believe this is a gullible fool. 
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaWonderful movie!  An amazing historical chapter from the minds of men.
fdu10cX3pWAdelimeterByIshitaWow! That is really awesone.  I love it. It&#39;s great movies everyone.   Let&#39;s watch it.  It is real.  Thank you.  I like it a lot.

96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitajesus mary and joseph. do you expect me to believe it&#39;s the &quot;official&quot; trailer at 240p?
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is awful
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshita4k
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaI kept thinking Banshee was a sequel üòë
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaomg this trailer sucks! but the movie is awesome
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaHow politically incorrect is that?
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitawow Fiennes looks really good, interesting. He can do an accent alright!
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaFeels like a play which is interesting.
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know these two worked together before!
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaMooie stad Brugge üíõüñ§
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaPeople, please, stop spreading nonsense about 240p. Most trailers on YouTube 13 years ago were at least 720p.

96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshita... Ahorita la voy a ver. Linda noche, mami üçìüíñ
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaTrailer sucks comparing to movie
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitatrailer had Pixies song, that&#39;s about all good there is about this &quot;comedy&quot;
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaPercival Graves, Mad-eye Moody, Voldemort, and Fleur Delacour all in one place lol
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaMy home town :-)
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer doesn&#39;t fit the movie at all, the movie is 100 times better than the trailer, why did you make a comedy trailer of such a serious  movie üò†? The background music of this film is very tragic, while watching this film, in the end i cried ü•∫.
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshita240p? Come on Focus Features, surely you can do better!
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitamy mom grew up in brugge from 8 to 15 years old and apparently this movie represents bruges well... touristy, and gray and depressing...
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshita240p? are you kidding?
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaHow is a trailer on an official channel 240p?
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitathe trailer is so horribly edited omg
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitahorrible trailer, excellent movie
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitanow you do :-P
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaYour loss.
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a Belgian and we never heard of this movie...
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshita1 guy do not like the fairytale xD
96harmMOyiYdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s with all the f*ing censoring oO
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaWitherspoon..sweet home Alabama...fear...cruel intentions..
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t she say before she liked tucks accent and then she says it&#39;s a flaw and stuff like make up your mind
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaShown in:<br>The Big Year<br>In Time<br>Tower Heist <br>Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol<br>The Grey<br>Chronicle
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYkbJMX0d_w&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> so you&#39;re not backing off?<br>Nope<br>HILARIOUS
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaThis was an masterful treat of spy comedy.<br><br>Just awesome.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%2310yearsago">#10yearsago</a>üíéüéû
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaShit mOvie
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitai love this film seen it about 3 times twice online and 3rd on dvd but must admit online is bad quality but the most funny i can remember is when she in house and the FDR and tuck sneak into her house without her know oh and the panitball scene
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitathis is like the males version of a romantic comedy lol
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Capt. KIRK you dumbass
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitawho cares? me... and maybe 6 more that like my comment... 
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitawho care&#39;s
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshita@videoeta ushhh....i hope not! :S
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaSo lemme get this straight. Two guys realize they&#39;re dating the same woman, and their first reaction ISN&#39;T to immediately dump that cheating bitch on the curb?

Sounds like a horrible movie and a horrible plot.
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitareese witherspoon makes this worth watching!
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaMustang! woohoo! 
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaI dont like this cuz Bux Bunny did not feature.
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitawhat a piece of this
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaIt should&#39;ve been Tom Hardy versus Ryan Gosling, now that would&#39;ve been an epic battle!
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitaAt the end of this movie, I have a weird feeling that Tom Hardy and Chris Pine&#39;s characters will realize their true love for each other.
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitalook good
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitalol, i miss chris pine xD
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitahey guys lets go watch this!
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitalooks like fun :) ...but i think the woman shouldn&#39;t Reese... i dunno.. pick someone else that gorgeous ;p
iYkbJMX0d_wdelimeterByIshitawhen when when?

gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaIf there&#39;s one surefire way out of the recession, it&#39;s to follow your dreams. I&#39;m an ice-sculptor, but instead of using ice, I use the frozen blood of twenty-something,¬†pseudo-alpha-male¬†hipsters.

gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gave me cancer.<br>We europeans have been partying for years, enjoying great music and amazing clubs. Then you americans arrived and turned everything into the usual sold out shit (EDM)<br>.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaOnly watching for zac efron
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaonly came for some Ratajkowski
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitathis will be fucking AWESOME !! I will sure to watch this shit. and I will check out those tracks!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!! Zac is amazing.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaAgain, whole movie in the trailer. Just give me a delusion that this story could be different
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThe guy from red riding hood is so fuckkng hot. The girl looks like Kendall Jenner. And obviously the most inportany person in the movie ZAC SEXY EFRON!!!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaF a c e p a l m x1000000000
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitai like how people can probably relate to this movie but for real this just gives always the whole movie like why even watch if i seen the whole thing in 3 mins. trailers should really just be less than a minute seriously
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaAmm, i dont get it
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait for this movie :o
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLame...

gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait for that !
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty decent, I d watch it even without this cast but having Zac Efron ( one of my fav young actors atm ) and the smoking hot Emily Ratajkowski ( and yes I did check her surname again to make sure I wont make a fool out of myself ) it sure is a plus..
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLove you WB but..... Im gonna skip this  shit
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaFYI the first song is Hellbent by Mystery Skulls.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was a joke. Nope!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be awesome! Can&#39;t wait
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaWorst.movie.ever 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshita can&#39;t wait for the movie üòç
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaWhat people don&#39;t understand is that this is a movie ABOUT Electronic Dance Music. The rave scene &amp; DJs. It&#39;s not suppose to be an action, etc. it&#39;s a movie about a genre of music &amp; this movie features famous DJs such as Dillon Francis, Alesso &amp; Nicky Romero. I can&#39;t wait to see this movie!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaEmily Ratajkowski enough said  
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaEmily Ratajkowski&#39;s dance moves are on point.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaüòç can&#39;t wait!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaI WILL ONLY SEE THIS FUCKING MOVIE TO SEE MY LOVE EMRATA!!!!! IN LOVE WITH HER
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here just for Emily. I&#39;d pay the cinema ticket even if she was starring in a bug documentary
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitalittle late for april fools isn&#39;t it?!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaAt first I was like oh man this relates to me cause its all about my high school and college struggles but then they were like FUCK SCHOOL AND JOBS BRO, SELL SHIT ON EBAY AND PARTY SON. Then I was like aw yeah THESE guys know how to throw a party and probably are gonna get laid bring on the good times! But then Zac reveals the complicated science of DJing and I was like YO BRO you are blowing my mind right now, and if you have xray vision you should use that power to look at chicks naked. But then its like HOW BIG do they REALLY wanna go? Like all the way? What if they sell out? What if they have to clean pools? What if they fall in love with a hot chick in a bikini that like finally gets Zac for Zac you know? Like the real Zac underneath all the DJing. And like what if they have to get like regular office jobs for some reason, idk it could happen! One things for sure, their totally gonna jump in pools in slow motion which is what life is all about! Can&#39;t wait to see this in IMAX 3D
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaabsolutely loved the trailer! looks like it&#39;s gonna be a great movie, can&#39;t wait to see it!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaI love Zac Efron though so I&#39;ll be seeing it
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaToo many hot guys. Help
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaA film to learn that everyone can do some shitty EDM and be a star.¬†<br>Emily seems to be the only interest of this movie
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaMuch better than Jem and the Holograms 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThe song is called &quot;You and me&quot; by Bassnectar
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaOmg that was amazing! Was hot af. Love u Zac!! üòç
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaamazing cant wait 2 c it , wish u all the best to all of u x

gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaBrittany Furlan! Haha
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThis is disgusting. EDM Crap wrapped up in a Zac Efron Teenie Romance. The High School Musical Kids will love it
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitanot a trailer but a fucking summary!¬†<br>Note to myself : videos&#39;title always lie
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song that finishes out the trailer?
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song called starting at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZzAeYWXFpk&amp;t=01m35s">01:35</a>? 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! üòÅ
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really bad, EDM sucks, give me real house and techno artists any day of the week over David guetta and co.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThis stinks!
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaSeems like an awesome movie I&#39;ll definitely give it a watch. 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks preety good to me..
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLove this trailer! This movie is gonna be amazing! 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaReally, the dj life üòí<br>
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaSo Project X but with a good message?  Not sure if it will be an inspirational film or another comedy or maybe  both. At least it inspired me to follow my dreams
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaWe Are Your Friends...Wowwww
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaDoes not look that bad. I&#39;ll watch it.
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaLol
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThe title for the movie is not that good. When watching this trailwr, it completely slipped my mind as to what the movie was called. <br>Looks somewhat interesting,  has my attention.  
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song in the end?? 
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaZac Efron ¬† = BAD BAD BAD :/
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThink this looks amazing, Emliy Ratajowski isn&#39;t even real tho, she can&#39;t be

gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaThird
gZzAeYWXFpkdelimeterByIshitaSecond!! 
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks funny.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI swear that guy sounds just like brian griffin from family guy
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan somebody PLEASE link the version of this with the Christopher Lloyd scene?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitadid I just see Jackie chan?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitacharlize theron! &lt;3
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see this!!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> How can you not laugh at that?!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if Seth MacFarlane is reading these comments?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThe book is better. It is actually very funny.¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> &quot;Mila Kunis, Mila Kunis!&quot;
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s good to see some of the cast from Family Guy and Ted. I think the plot line that I have read online is decent. I am wanting to see it this summer.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be hilarious
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThe Ted trailer was funny, and the movie was hilarious. So nothing against Seth MacFarlane, but this looks like crap and is probably going to be crap, but with a few funny moments
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason none of this made me laugh. Its like they are trying too hard.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaWhen they are sitting round the fire and he says says gibberish that is translated to &quot;Okay, Okay&quot; he says Mila Kunis, Mila Kunis. Fun Easter Egg &gt;:D
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI am going to watch the HELL out of this movie.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitai think this looks like a winner but seth shouldnt be acting hes freaking awful¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson is such a great actor. Schindler&#39;s List, Michael Collins.. why is he doing this shit now? Although this is funny its still a fucking shitload of bullshit, same level as Scary Movie III.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaLol when he said mila kunis for fine XD
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaExcept the actual wild west wasn&#39;t really that wild or dangerous at all. Crime rate was actually much lower than most modern cities and over all fatalities were not much worse than now. But you know...HOLLYWOOD!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaHey they voice-casted Brian from Family Guy to dub over the main character.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks better than I expected. It&#39;s retarded, but it looks retarded in the Naked Gun sense and not in the Epic Movie sense. I will see this.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitathe sarah silverman part was hot as fuck.¬†

2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaPretty excited about this movie.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI guess if you like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies, you&#39;ll probably like this.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitagonna be thinking brian griffin the whole time.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaOne Way To Die In The Movie Theatre¬†¬†Ôªø
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaEven if this movie wasn&#39;t that funny when it comes out, it still looks like a well made movie. Keep up the good work Seth but seriously, listen to @jon Richards, we need a¬†Family Guy movie¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaDamn Seth you did it again.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCharlize is so perfect tho
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitawhat . the . fuck . O.O

2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI love how he said mila kunis to say fine to the Indian 
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitacant wait
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaHELL YEAH THE LEGEND OF BARNATUIDE LIVES ON!!!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a bad episode of family that was just animated really, REALLY well
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis makes me want to play red dead redemption
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaPeople die at the fair....
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this! :-)
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaNERD! DORK! TOOL! Best part of this trailer!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitayes this look like the new 3 amigos ¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitalol he said mila kunis mila kunis?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaWas the Native American played by Jackie Chan?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else notice that he said &quot;mila kunis, mila kunis&quot; when he was telling the native Americans &quot;fine&quot; lol
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> that&#39;s what happened to me.. during my first date..
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaSeth...you are awesome!! Can&#39;t wait to see the movie! It looks so good! :D
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaWhen I saw this trailer in theatres, there was a much funnier joke when Giovanni Ribisi sees Sarah Silverman&#39;s vag, he says &quot;Ok, time to close the bible!&quot; I don&#39;t know why that wasn&#39;t here.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious. I couldn&#39;t help but hear Brian the whole time.<br>Did the splinter joke remind anyone else of the Family Guy episode where Peter was an English settler? &quot;Aw crap, I got a splinter. Well, it&#39;s been nice knowing you guys.&quot; lol
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThe only funny thing about that was the &quot;Mila Kunis&quot; bit.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Don&#39;t drink and horse, you know that!&quot;<br>had me done xd
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitai cant wait to see this!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaXD I totally wanna see that
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis Mila Kunis... LOL
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaSeth MacFarlane, take my money now. ¬†:-D
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazingly funny!!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitai find it funny that they make fun of Liam Neeson being in a Western in Family Guy, and then MacFarlen casts him in his new western.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitalooks slapdash... but maybe fun.¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitasarah silverman is soo sexyy
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaFinally a new western with historical overtones. &quot;Mila Kunis Mila Kunis &quot; :D
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitagotta see this
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaSeth yelling does not amplify the funny so i wish they never tried that.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a> Did I just see Jackie Chan plays as Native American ?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis Mila Kunis
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaEverything that&#39;s not you is trying to kill you? Well that&#39;s basically Australia ALL the time,.<br><br>And is Seth McFarlane getting younger? Seriously, I think this guy&#39;s going all Benjamin Button on us...
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaAll I hear is Brian
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI love how they reference &quot;black guys&quot; but there are absolutely none in the movie.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI have to admit, I did NOT think I would EVER see the day when Seth McFarlaine would even MAYBE hit a winner (in terms of making something I personally like) but well...when this comes out on DVD, Imma see what&#39;s up with this.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaSong?¬†<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a>
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaoh family guy has gone down the shitter and everyone who didn&#39;t know who i was freaked out when they heard ted&#39;s voice, because, &quot;omg he sounds like peter&quot;. i should make more movies.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a> aAaHhhHWww... don&#39;t be to hard in yourself! even your shooting with black bullets! ahHaAhahHA. (HOW to troll to humiliate someone.)<br>NICE AND HILARIOUS!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitai thought Mikey Bolts was Seth McFarlin
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaso excited¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis xD Meg
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitalol
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that plays right after the death by ice cube scene?
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitahilarious but the acting seems horrible....¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita&quot;If i was a black guy, this is the meanest trick you can play on me&quot; 
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaSeth&#39;s voice just doesn&#39;t fit the part, he sounds like he&#39;s making a sales pitch to a bunch of upper class twats
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaEnough said
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis is Fine.<br>I see what you did there :P
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThe problem is, for a movie that&#39;s supposed to be set in 1800s, everything just looks so... modern. It&#39;s distracting.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaNice dentures
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitalmao<br><br>&quot;mila kunis mila kunis&quot;
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaI lol&#39;d. I&#39;m up for it. :)

2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sOa-2EhbTU&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> he says &quot;Mila Kunis&quot; like its their language <br><br>The actor Mila Kunis is the voice of Meg in Family guy
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitayeeseth
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it!!!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaThe red band trailer is better.
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaif i was a black guy this is the meanest trick you could play on me lmao
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell Again Amanda Seyfried is barely in the trailer ? !!! so disapointing¬†
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this!
2sOa-2EhbTUdelimeterByIshitaLooking good :)
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitawhy do they have to do this to a great movie?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThis looks stupid
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaDid it seriously say &quot;A NEW BEGINNING IN HORROR MOVIES???&quot; this is a regurgitated pile of shit capitalizing on an original script:film that&#39;s almost 20 years old. Come up with new ideas. This is pathetic
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThe reason the first one was scary was because it was the fear of the unknown. It hinted at the fact that there was something paranormal but it could have easily just been some teens trying to fuck with them, or some murderer, or ANYTHING. The movie hinted at so many possibilities at the beginning, with the creepy lady with a fence made out of twigs (like the stick men in the trees) and the two fishermen who knew a lot about the Blair witch, where it could have been any number of things that could have happened to them, not just something paranormal. This fucking movie not only is an attempt to bank off the original, but ruins what made the original scary, and takes away whatever people wanted to believe. Everyone is scared of the unknown, but paranormal shit is so fucking over played now a days. If you liked the original Blair witch or not, it fucking changed horror films forever. We don&#39;t need &quot;Paranormal Activity: Woods&quot;. This is such bullshit.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitanever liked the first one. This looks like a jumpscare orgy. Not impressed
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI hope they show the real witch and it turns out to be Hilary Clinton at the end of the movie.  Now that ending would be better than the original. :D
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI hope we&#39;ll get to see the witch!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitameh...
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitawho else watched this movie tonight?!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaPlease tell me this isn&#39;t yet another found footage movie.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWell this looks terrible.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaMan this is awesome!  I&#39;m excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitais this remake or sequel?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaughhh...friggin Hollywood.....lame...
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWow! Loved the original Blair Witch Project movie. Hopefully this is as scary as it looks.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaNice
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaMy question is, will we actually see the witch in this movie?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshita¬°Se ve tan genial que ya quiero verla!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI remember being 21 in the cinemas in 1999 when part 1 came out, the genuine screams, the fear from the people when it hit, such a landmark moment in cinema! Not the first movie to do found footage but up til 1999, it was the <b>best</b> to do it that way. I can&#39;t believe they kept this under wraps like this! So excited now at 38 that I get to see a proper followup and it&#39;s not being left with that utter disappointment cash in &#39;book of shadow&#39;!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWOO! \0/
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaim so fucking excited about this! this could almost redeem this year from the utter shit reboot of ghostbusters. bring on the witch! haha
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWe gonna actually see the witch this time?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitadoes this ignore the events of BWP 2?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitai don&#39;t know how to feel about this...
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaLooks stupid like the other ones
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI had no idea that they were making another Blair Witch movie.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaMan, there goes my theory that this was a killer tree movie. Now that I know what it actually is.... I still wish it were a killer tree movie. LOL
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaNo.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaBlair Witch: Are We Still Rolling?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaLooks like shit.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThis is a movie that I don&#39;t think will capture the scariness of the original but will do a good job. Films have became to CGI filled which lessens the movies scariness. It&#39;s been a very long time and the original Blair Witch is one of the greatest paranormal movies ever made so this should be interesting. Super stoked for this movie, let&#39;s hope it is good!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitais it me, or was this kept pretty down low? It&#39;s coming out in like couple months and it&#39;s the first I hear about it
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshita1000% more budget still not half as great as the first one
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThis is an extremely odd surprise considering that a few months ago this movie looked like it was going to be a standalone horror movie called The Woods. I&#39;m not really sure how I feel about it now. Though Wingard and Barrett are talented, so I&#39;m sure they can pull it off.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaLooks really generic and nowhere near as good as the original.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaCool BW3 Can we learn from our mistakes and not give the rookie the map please lol
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaOK I&#39;m seeing this, and I&#39;m not watching anymore trailers or footage
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitathe trailer was kinda of crappy and generic but because I love the first one and Adam wingard is directing I&#39;m still hyped as hell
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI was already interested in the film before. Now that I know what it truly is, my butt will definitely be in a theater seat this September.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitafirst The woods then Blair witch.. ughhhhhh
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaPower Rangers trailer ???
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThey turned a psychological thriller into an action film? No thanks.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaBlair Witch was cool and new in &#39;99. Not sure what could be interesting about it now.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThis might be the movie we should have gotten when this horrendous film first came out. I like that they are using the stick monsters from the video game series, those things were awesome when they were revealed. <br><br>This series could have been really spectacular but they used the best material for video games, books and A web short.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshita-_- shit
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThe Broodwich?!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitalmao at the stock sound at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=girSv9UH_V8&amp;t=00m55s">00:55</a>
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaIf this movie does not live up to the expectations then i&#39;ll Blair Witch yo ass!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaIs the first sequel canon or are they ignoring it?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitadid i just watched the full movie through this trailer?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaHere we go again! No way possible as good as the original but still excited to see!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaBLAIR WITCH PROJECT 3!!!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWhen a movie sucked so bad, why on earth would anyone make a sequel?  Someone gave me a VHS copy of the first Blair Witch, and threw it away because I didn&#39;t want it wasting any space on my shelf.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaYawns. üí§ üíÖüèΩ
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaNo fucking way !?!?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaOkay, THIS is more like it. I personally couldn&#39;t get into the first one because there was no indication of presence from anything in the film, no footsteps, no wind, not even an eerie hum or ear ringing noise to indicate the floating witch from the original design. Here we actually hear things other than a few children giggles and see vague glimpses of something. some indication of presence. I get the first film had the budget of a sandwitch (wah wah), but even with that budget, SOME sort of effect could&#39;ve done something. It always felt like they were alone and felt less real due to the constant insistence on using the camera the way they did, made it less scary for me. Here they use go pro  and cellphone style cameras and actually DROP THEM when they run. Although it looks a little jumpscarefest-y, so trust is still not %100.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaCan I play Blair Witch vs Slenderman on MUGEN?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaA bit of trivia, if you don&#39;t wanna do your own research. At the end of this trailer there&#39;s a little snippet of a song sung creepily by a woman. That song was actually the trailer song for &quot;The Woods&quot; which is actually what this film&#39;s original title was supposed to be. I guess for a marketing push the true name of &quot;Blair Witch&quot; was kept from audiences in favor of a more generic horror title to build intrigue on the film. Shows what a little misdirection can do for people. Sorry for the super long trivia fact I just thought I&#39;d share it if no one wanted to do research.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI hate trailers that make you feel like youve just watched the entire movie in a couple minutes
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitanot really as good as it could of been
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited because Wingard made two of my 2010&#39;s favorite horror/action films ever: You&#39;re Next &amp; The Guest!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitateens getting scared same ol ish
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaMaybe?? Who knows. =/
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaBest horror movie trailer I&#39;ve seen in a long time! Lionsgate has always been good about their horror movies so I have confidence.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaFinally!!!!! I have waited Blair Witch 3 for long time. Thank God...<br><br>I hope this movie better than Blair Witch 2
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really hoping this is good, but I dunno, the trailer isn&#39;t giving me much hope. The mythology behind The Blair Witch Project is really interesting and creepy (the story of the witch, the serial killer Rustin Parr, the mass murder at coffin rock). It did NOT have jump scares. I hope that the movie is more understated than the trailer makes it seem...with that being said I&#39;m still going to watch the hell out of it. lol
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI want trailer cutter to get shot
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaremember when people thought the blair witch was a real documentary? Those were the good days
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitanever been this early
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWhen I first got here, this had 666 views!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaWow. This came outta nowhere. The original film was one of the most terrifying, horrifying movies ever made.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaHey, it worked for 10 Cloverfield Lane, right?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t see anything! it&#39;s all dark
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI dated a girl named Blair. She was such a bitch.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaOh shit less than a thousand views, top comment time. Hmmm<br><br>Uhhh last time I came this early......ah fuck i got nothin
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaLa verdad, me encanta Esto me traumo de peque√±o por un buen tiempo.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s power rangers trailer?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaSo, is he Heather&#39;s brother?
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitarating??? if its pg13 thumbs down
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic. Gave me chills.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitauh parece que esta buena la peli üëç
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitathey made it too generic the scary part of the blair witch was what you didn&#39;t see
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaPost the Power Rangers teaser.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaSo they go in the woods, get lost and murdered by the witch? I&#39;ve seen this already.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaIt would&#39;ve been cool if they kept the name The Woods and had it be a surprise, but I understand why they&#39;d change the name. People know The Blair Witch, so it&#39;ll bring in more people.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshita666 views
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know if this is a Reboot, a Remake or a Sequel... either way... WHY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS!? &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; its an amazing Film, the sequel fucking sucks and now this? Why? Fuck the money men. Do something that its actually a  good content, a good film and not a fucking rehash of a classic!
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaYeah... give Adam Wingard the keys to that HALLOWEEN reboot ASAP.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitalooks pretty boring, would rather watch badabook or some old asian horror masterpiece like SHUTTER
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s actually a pretty depressing town, those woods aren&#39;t scary it&#39;s the Godamn Raven rock nuclear facility and other government owned property that freaks me out. They are really unhappy when you wander into Camp David
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaSo happy this is NOT a remake. Yes, its still Hollywood running out of Ideas but I am actually excited for this. <br><br> The Blair Witch Project scared the shit outta me as a kid so I am hoping this is better then recent horror films.
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaThere have been a lot of remakes/reboots in movies lately...<br>Don&#39;t know how I feel about this one
girSv9UH_V8delimeterByIshitaHells yah

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaAt the end Jeff sounds like the old man from Pawn Stars.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitajeff bridges!!!!!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitathe Texas Rangers should be utterly ashamed to have someone like matt damon representing their ranks. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitahey guys u know what&#39;s awesome? where my dad works, they are recording the soundtrack for this movie all this week, can&#39;t wait to see it!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Cash + Western films = Win
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaBout time a decent looking movie
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaBad ass!!!!! 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaThis could shape up to be one of the best Movies of all time!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitahe said &quot;cock burn.&quot;

DURR HURR HURR
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI admit I didn&#39;t even know this was a remake, let alone a remake of a John Wayne movie, but this looks fucking awesome! The cast and the humor between Damon and Bridges should be great and I love 1:50 to the end of the trailer! Jeff Bridges is badass in this! Brolin&#39;s great too. And what Johnny Cash song is this?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna be good...... i like the song i remember it from splinter cell conviction trailer
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@rickybobby4321 thanks guy
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know if they could remake a Wayne movie but got half way through the trailer and thought this looks pretty epic and that the girls voice sounds quite mature o-o and then they played Johnny Cash and I was like &quot;Fuck I&#39;m sold 8{&#39;D...&quot;
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI got half way through the trailer and thought this looks pretty epic and that the girls voice sounds quite mature and then they played Johnny Cash and I was like &quot;Fuck I&#39;m sold 8{&#39;D...&quot;
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not one to get angry or talk shit, but this travesty can not go unchallenged. THIS IS BULLSHIT! Everyone involved in this movie are losers! John Wayne is a legend and so are his movies. FUCK HOLLYWOOD! They&#39;ve gone too far. ANyone who supports this movie can go fuck themselves.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaJeff Bridges + Matt Damon + Josh Brolin = MAGIC.

This film&#39;s got big shoes to fill, but I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how they pull this one off. :)
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaWow!  I cannot wait for this!  I didn&#39;t even know they were working on another movie.  This looks amazing.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitawhat song is this if yall dont mind me asking
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@HypnoticZombie No he doesn&#39;t. wow
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI fucking love the Coen Bros!  
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaJeff &quot;FUCKING&quot; Bridges!!!!!!!!!!!!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitathis looks so awesome
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaPause at 2:05 , he looks almost exactly like John Marston from RDR!!!!!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaI got chills the first time I watched this trailer
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita0:56 - The Dude. loll
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita0:28 - it sounds like he says &quot;what do you want broad?&quot; lol that&#39;s what I initially heard til I played it back a few times.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitalooks fuckin badass
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song from Johnny Cash?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Cash&#39;s music + Matt Damon, Jeff Bridges, and Josh Brolin = a movie that I am undoubtedly going to see.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaThe Dude abides.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaTHE DUDE: Kicking ass and taking names.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@bosshog871 And now they must be allowed to think about the wrath that&#39;s will eventually be set down upon them.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitathe 8 people that didnt like this are pussys
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has too much awesome... Matt Damon = badass. Josh Brolin also = badass. Jeff Bridges = Legendary super-badass. Coen Brothers directing...

Fuck! December can&#39;t come any sooner?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaBad. Ass.

Is it December yet?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitamy head just exploded from pure epic testosterone
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@matwevius: thank you so much. i downloaded it :)
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@matwevius the first musical arrengement is from where?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaThe Coen Brothers are amazing. Jeff Bridges is amazing. Together they&#39;re unbeatable. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitatrack is sick!!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@Lizann1203
Johnny Cash - &quot;God&#39;s Gonna Cut You Down.&quot;
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@TheWiseGuy784 TOTALLY agree. It&#39;s going to be a &quot;Dude&quot; Holiday XD
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@drdistracto707 Agreed.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitai love the song at 1:20...anyone know the name??
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitanot really into Westerns...but this movie might make me think otherwise
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see Bridges and Damon in this. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Josh Brolin&#39;s scar ? Oh no, sorry, wrong movie.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaTwo Jeff Bridges films. This, and &quot;Tron: Legacy&quot;.

It&#39;s going to be one hell of a Christmas.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitacool 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaYou can smell the horse sweat and and gunsmoke! Loved Charles Portis&#39; novel, hated the way Hal Wallis &amp; Henry Hathaway made the first version, with the exception of John Wayne, who was terrific. This is obviously a very different take on it, one that looks like it will be faithful to Portis&#39; original! The Coen Brothers are a great choice to make TRUE GRIT the way it should be made! 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaBig Lebowski is back )
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Shot? or killed?..&quot;    Icecooold!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaFinally a good looking western. Fuck that Jonah hex shit

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@breddan96 Sorry already watched. And the trailer shows everything that the movie will have. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@kennjad Never said the movie will be bad. Learn to read. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaOK, this looks like the best film of 2010 and I havn&#39;t even seen it.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome, apart from the awful eyepatch 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaquite a long trailer

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitalooks good
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitadid i just see a bear riding a horse? lol
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@signboyy I was actually just upset you implied they got inspiration from a jim jarmusch movie, otherwise I&#39;d say you are right.

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@signboyy the coens are only inspired by their own genius.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaSick
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitawow, looks pretty good, as usual us peeps in uk, will prob have to wait a couple of months to see this, looks pretty awesome though. been a while since i seen a good western, wish studios would make more of em, best recent 1 i seen was the remake of 3:10 to yuma, and even that was a few years ago now!!
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaOw yeah, me likey! 
Western from the coen bros, hope that is just as good as No country,,

* Johnny cash - God&#39;s gonna cut you down; name of the song

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaTrue Grit
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitalooks like hes is only good at one thing-shooting. and thats enough
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaJeff Bridges + Coen Brothers = Epic Win!

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaBetty Ross the same as Bruce Banner&#39;s girlfriend? I think they could think of a diffrent name.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaWhen will they stop showing all movie in one 2:29 minutes long trailer? 
I guess now i won&#39;t have to watch the movie. Thanks Hollywood. 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaWe haven&#39;t had a really good western for a while. This looks good, remake or no.
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitawahaaaa Matt Damon!!!!!!

CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@Seelenhueter Not Johnny Cash! The Song before! 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitaOh come on, there doing a remake of this. Wasn&#39;t the classic with John Wane enough?
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitadid you know that Red Dead Redemption invented the western genre
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshita@SnoopysOtherBird its &quot;God&#39;s Gonna Cut You Down&quot; by Johnny Cash 
CUiCu-zuAgMdelimeterByIshitayay

dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaDid Rick from Walking Dead need a Southern accent?<br>I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s a movie made in America.............
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaSo THAT&#39;S what happened to Amy&#39;s parents!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaOh man....can&#39;t wait for this one!!!! Loved her in Doctor Who! I hope it&#39;s doesn&#39;t disappoint....
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaHer american accent is good but I could still hear some Scottish. Haha.

dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaHmmm looks like a Scp foundation artifact
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaoh my god its Karen Gillan
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaI saw this at the Toronto film festival and it was one of the creepiest movies I&#39;ve seen in years. ¬† Sooooo good. ¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAyyyyy she&#39;s from doctor who 
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAmy Pond in a horror flick, wow im happy for her, she is trying new things and that&#39;s awesome

dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll always see Karen as Amy Pond!!!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaRental...............
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaKaren, you are an incredible actress I LOVE your normal accent please stay scottish
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWWE pictures? pass....
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitawhat i wanna know is why is WWE Studios working on this as well? i mean they normally do movies with the WWE Superstars in them not these kinds of movies and no Wrestilers are in this movie<br><br>although i wanna see this
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWhole trailer ruined by the shit WWE logo!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitacant wait!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaNo Doctor to save you this time, Karen . . .

dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaso their dad is Satan
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThat was trippy.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaOh dear, Karen. The accent just doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Everything else is cool, though.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaShe still sounds so scottish even with the horrible attempt of the accent
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWhy did they make her use an American accent? Stupid idea.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaShould have called the Doctor.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitanice.looks scary.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAn evil mirror huh? Well, I&#39;ll buy it I guess.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaFinally, an original idea for a horror film. I&#39;ve never seen anything resembling the plot of this film, and if this trailer reflects anything about the film, it&#39;s that it looks quite excellent.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaDo you know who&#39;s hinding in the mirror ? Prisoner Zero
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaSoctt¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThey should have had Karen Gillan rock her Scottish accent....so sexy. Sheeeeeesh, I love me some Amy Pond. 
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWell made up that I watched this just before bed. Best decision I&#39;ve made this week.¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaKAREN GILLIAN YESSSSS JFQJKFKJHDKQJWDF
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaDANG! this should be scary
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAmy Pond and Kara Thrace in the same science-fiction movie? = FANGASM
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitayou could say they opened a rift a¬†Oculus rift
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaLooks okay! 
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaDios soy fan de &#39;&#39;incidius&#39;&#39; ¬†esta pelicula va estar mortal ya quiero que llegue a los cines de Republica Dominicana ;)
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaLooks to have all the elements of a good horror
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWhile I don&#39;t think there are horror movies anymore this looks intriguing. I think its more of a suspense type movie. I might go see this in the theater! ¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThis a weird advertising for a gaming equipment. 
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaohhhhhh
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWe know it is made by the people who made Paranormal Activity because of...... CAMERAS LOTS AND LOTS OF CAMERAS¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAmy, don&#39;t you know that eating glass is harmful and unhealthy?
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaAmy, just call Rory and The Doctor and everything will be fine(:
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaIs this compatible with oculus rift......lol
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitai need to stop watching trailers they basically show the whole movie or trailers should be shorter¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaim going to watch it
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaLight bulbs are so much better with some salt.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaApples are rubbish...
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitai only wanted to watch it cos my little Amelia Pond is in it, but now i just want to watch it because it looks amazing! not to mention Karen&#39;s attempt at the American accent, haha brilliant!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaCALM DOWN IT JUST A MIRRIOR ALRIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like it&#39;s going to be a good movie.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie needs to come and go already, so I can stop getting excited for Oculus Rift news every time I see something about it, and then being disappointed.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Recall? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYJrxezWLUk&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYJrxezWLUk&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a>
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaKaren Gillan and her <b>American Accent</b>!
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s The Doctor when you need him?
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThe light buln thing seems like something someone would goof up and do, please someone make a movie viewable with Oculus rift or one based on it
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitalooks good and different
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty terrifying! The light bulb bit creeps me out so much ah<br>I&#39;m so excited for this movie
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaSooooooo excited:D
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaLooks alright, i&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t have to use shakey cam and jump scares.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThey should really do more funny horror movies 
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Doctor Who series 7 &quot;Hide&quot;. &quot;I am the Doctor and I am afraid&quot;¬†
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaOculus... rift! hell yes.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaThe failsafe device needs to be set up on a dead man&#39;s switch or it&#39;s useless.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitalooks good.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWWE studios? Really?
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaI thought Amy was stuck in the past? She has to send a stress signal to the Doctor.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaSo good to see her going beyond the doctor. Two movies within this year.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaSo good to see her going beyond the doctor. Two movies within this year.
dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWajib tonton!!

dYJrxezWLUkdelimeterByIshitaWe just basically saw the whole plot in this trailer, so no need to go see it any more if you were going to, hate trailers like this.

MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWhen Ouija (The Original) and Poltergeist drink too much wine together.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaHow the fuck does a movie this horrible possibly get a sequel? I&#39;m baffled
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitasam and dean would have taken care of this in like 5 minutes tbh.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m always going to know her as the patient from grey&#39;s anatomy
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaFinding Dorris
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why so many people are bashing this, I seriously thought it looked great
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaUnited States of America: Origin of Evil
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThis looks sooooo bad.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitahopefully it&#39;s better then the last one
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitawas curious about this movie... then i saw the 666 likes... thats a nope from me

MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaStop that BIG MOUTH effect :s<br>It&#39;s not scary
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck is this shit?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI dont like ouija 2 because is nul the one is very good
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaDid that lady play carslile wife in twilight
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a Blumhouse movie?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaDid not see the first one.. Looked generic. This looks like it is trying at least to be creative in how it tells its story.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaHow exactly do you guys know if it&#39;s gonna be bad or not because none of you have watched it sooo
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLooks fairly creepy and interesting . I own the original haven&#39;t watched it yet but this looks like a good err prequel I guess ?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitalooks like a fun time this time around
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI think I&#39;ll get me a Real Ouija board opening doors seems fun even if evil is what comes out :)
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t fuck with ouija kids
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThis film shouldn&#39;t exist, it shouldn&#39;t fucking exist. I don&#39;t give a shit who directs it, it won&#39;t be a good fucking movie.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitawtf trailer ass mf scary beginning üò≠ . savagery to my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJIcZGEjjwo&amp;t=4m08s">4:08</a>am heart and soul üíÄüëå
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaMike Flanagan though...never saw the first movie, never will. It will be amazing if this movie could actually make everything that was done wrong in the first movie done right.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitathis is awful. santanic...
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaif this movie  is  PG-13 DON&#39;T waste your  time no good  can come out of a horror movie  that is PG -13
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshita—Ö–µ—Ä–Ω—è
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaTypical generic possession film. Yawn.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThere are two good things in this trailer: the retro Universal logo and the Hermin&#39;s Hermits song. Everything else...well it looks better than the first but its clearly just trying to ride off the success of the Conjuring series.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaOh shit, it&#39;s Elliot from E.T.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaIt looks far better than the first one.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitai do not understand what is going on this trailer tbh
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaOH HELL NO!
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThe first sucked major ass, but this looks much better. Creepy and not just jump scares, hopefully it&#39;s good, though Conjuring 2 set the bar pretty damn high.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE CONNECTED TO ALL THE EVIL¬†PROTRAIYAL MOVIES??????
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThe first one was lame... this looks super fuct O.o
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWow, the Universal logo looks different... Why is that?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know, this looks better than the first one, but still looks kinda bad. I&#39;m very intrigued though. Even though I think Mike Flanagan, is extremely overrated, I feel he will do a decent job. Oculus was okay and Hush was pretty good, but the only reason why people lose their minds over those films, is because 95% of horror films these days are complete trash. The teenage sister in this new film, cannot act whatsoever, so that&#39;s a major concern. I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see I guess!

MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaputaaaaaa me cague en la primera escenaaa co√±oii

MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait.üëç
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJIcZGEjjwo&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> what was that,that boy was about to throw
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thinks this is gonna be lit af?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThe first one didn&#39;t scare me
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThat looks like it would not be scary and I am a 10 year old
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWow gorgeous
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaPeople should really stop judging the movie before they see it, especially based off of the trailer. Movie trailers nowadays are like mini-films themselves. They&#39;re created by companies completely separate from the production team of the film itself. An entirely different group of people that weren&#39;t involved with the making of the film receive a rough copy of a movie and have to think of a way to present it to captivate the widest possible audience. They use many tactics to do this, and a lot of what goes into movie trailer production is a manipulation of the actual film itself. Scenes play out and are edited differently in trailers than in the actual film many times. So stop being so judgmental and wait for the actual film to come out before you say anything. And if you KNOW you&#39;re not going to see the film, why are you taking the time out of your day to post about it and be so negative instead of doing something else with your time? Are your comments even productive? There&#39;s a difference between giving and honest, constructive opinion of a film and simply saying &quot;this looks awful lol&quot; or &quot;this will FLOP&quot;. At the very least elaborate, or don&#39;t speak!
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaIt looks good and Mike Flanagan is a great director. I don¬¥t even know why he accepted to make the sequel of such an awful movie.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaExcited üò¶
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI that the firs one was okay. Maybe this one is abit better.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitatrailer looks better than the 1st one, but is the movie better? hum
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitai not gonna lie the beginning really got me üòÆ
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLooks hilarious
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitanow we&#39;re talking!
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaReally another weeeji
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m tired of paranormal movies can we get some monster movies like the thing
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaThese Polish subtitles say something about the concentration camps in Poland during the war in 1939. They describe the appearance of the residential buildings and the place where the burned body, is a kind of diary
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaevil has a beginning in Poland
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t get why everyone is praising Mike Flanagan... honestly
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaCome on universal I expected better
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWhy does this exist?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaPeople that are going to see this are either brain dead or under the age or 12.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaAnother normal horoe movie with endinf cycle of boards, flying spagetti monsters, walking on walls, sounds.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitamais algm do brasil ? /o
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLooks boring, why can nobody put together a good horror film these days?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLooks even worse than the first one
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitanot so scary this sucks
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaMike Flanagan is directing this so I hope it&#39;s at least half as good as his other films...
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWho asked for this?
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI like such trailers now i don&#39;t have to waste money to know the story of the movie
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI dont know I guess
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaGonna be a piece of sh*t (probably) but I&#39;ll still watch it. Online, because I&#39;m not forking over $12 to see this haha
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLoving the comments here. Psst, hey dumbasses, this is directed by Mike Flanagan. The guy who did Oculus, Hush, and is a contender for the new Halloween. He makes great movies. I know, it&#39;s weird that such a crappy movie as Ouija is getting a sequel, and it&#39;s even weirder that the sequel has a talented director at the helm, but maybe that talented director is a pretty good reason not to just dump all over this. And yes, this trailer does the ol&#39; jump scare thing, but that&#39;s how Hollywood edits trailers for horror movies.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLooks like there&#39;s some interesting ideas mixed in there (the scene where the older sister wakes up from the nightmare looks great, and the scam is a very good premise), but overall there seems to be too many jump scares and over the top horror. I&#39;ll wait until reviews before making a final judgement.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitalooks creepy and love the music!
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaHype hype
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaI am here before thousands
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaHOLY GARBAGE, THIS IS GETTING ANOTHER ONE.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaFor fuck&#39;s sake people don&#39;t support this jump Scare filled crap. watch some good horror movies that don&#39;t rely on jumpscares like The Witch, Green room, The Babadook, It follows. Crap like this ruins the horror Genre.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaWow I can&#39;t wait to watch this shitty horror movie !
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitahere before thousands
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT!!! THE FIRST ONE WAS TERRIBLE!!! UNIVERSALLY HATED!! WHY WOULD THEY DO ANOTHER ONE???!!! ARE TEENS REALLY THAT PATHETIC TO WATCH CRAP?!!!
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaGarbitch
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitaLook Universal, ghost movies and in generally paranormal movies are just dumb now. Go make films like Green Room.
MJIcZGEjjwodelimeterByIshitathis is gonna be just as bad as the first one
