HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThe Labours of Hercules is a parable to awaken the hero by taming the ego through a series of challenges where he has to reflect on his own errors in judgement to find inner strength...this film, in true Hollywood form distorts the original story to propagate the false notion that there is glory in the raising of an army, that a true hero seeks vengance rather than forgiveness, fights for money and lies about his identity.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThe Rock - zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaWe are not gonna talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HydiAICZq6I&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a>

HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaExcept the greek mythological monsters scenes lasted for a couple of minutes, it&#39;s good.

HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap! Dwayne Johnson with long hair!?!?
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitathis is already 6 years old I remember when this was new vividly
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaDear fucking lord what where they thinking with this trash? What in the fuck is wrong with the myth itself? HERACLES being tortured by his step mother HERA because of Zeus&#39; adultery. The only way for Heracles to achieve forgiveness is by completing the 12 tasks set out for him. Kill the lion, the hydra, the minotaur blah blah blah. The material is fucking there! These writers don&#39;t need to fuck with it! What in the holy mother of fuck is this Thor rip off shit? No fucking way am I giving this excrement the time of day. I refuse to watch this shit

HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThe best Hercules movie !!!
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaso apparently that guy actually wants to die; &quot;excuse me, that was my moment!&quot;...... lol
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaIt sucked
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitadoes this film take place in ancient greece or sparta?
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaGrunt Cox You Tube videos
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaFinally the rock has come back to HERCULES
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaAmazing  film
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaDamn... Dwayne Jhonson is made for this role. 
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaBig time false advertising in the trailer! The Greek monster scenes barely lasted 1 minute, its all a flashback. If you&#39;re watching on the assumption that the movie will follow Hercules doing the 12 labors with Clash of the Titans/God of War execution style, you will be highly disappointed.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitabuena movie
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThe children of the sons of God and the daughters of man the FALLEN ANGEL&#39;S CHILDREN THE NEPHILIM ......!! Hercules is the byproduct of the Fallen Angels and the daughters of man. The Nephilim......!!!!  I hope The Rock Dwayne Johnson didn&#39;t sell his soul to play all these Luciferian movies lluminati bought and sold.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThe children of the sons of God and the daughters of man the FALLEN ANGEL&#39;S CHILDREN THE NEPHILIM ......!! Hercules is the byproduct of the Fallen Angels and the daughters of man. The Nephilim......!!!!
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaIts a shame why didn&#39;t they just get an actor who can act who is handsome but average body type to play the part of Hercules why does he have to be a bodybuilder type when he could just be an ordinary looking guy who happens to be the son of Zeus and therefore have unimaginable strength why do we need a bodybuilder cos if they had done just that this movie could have been amazing. But the Rock can&#39;t act so we have another Sylvester Stallone on our hands which aint all bad but ain&#39;t all good either
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaFinally the rock is back in Hollywood
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaHe plays a really good white person
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this!!!!! 
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshita&quot; you&#39;re welcome &quot; quote (used in The Expandables and other movies) doesn&#39;t fit here in Ancient Greece, IMHO :)
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaAll the Australian&#39;s that watch Home &amp; Away....&quot;did you see that&quot; IT&#39;S STEPHEN PEACOCKE!!!! (Aka Brax!) :D 
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitamikor lesz a teljes film?? :)
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitajóó!! :)
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaale z tymi stringami to już przesada 
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitahell yeah
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a next movie in line with Pompeii and 300. Gladiator was actually nice and they at least tried to be historical accurate, but this is ridiculous.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaSo bad it&#39;s going to be great! Club that boar! Punch that guy! Throw that horse! Hercules, fuck yeah!
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitathe rock portraying kratos would not be a bad idea..
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/HydiAICZq6I?t=1m40s">1:40</a> is that ygritte from game of thrones? Ya know the girl who always says &quot;you know nothin jon snow&quot;
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitahmm, i dont know why but he looks more like a conan than a hercules to me.. but this looks good either way.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaWell, this looks pleasingly ridiculous. I may enjoy this far more than I&#39;ll admit.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaGratuitous butt shots aside, the trailer is already better than the entire Hercules film of Kellan Lutz. 
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaLol hollywood and their flat ass chicks -.- , I want BOOTY
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HydiAICZq6I&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a> best part
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaSeeing this for two reasons 1) The Rock and 2) That Irina Shayk ass...lol
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaI was cautiously optimistic at first but now I have to say... that looks very entertaining.  Can&#39;t wait to see it.
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be stupid crazy freshhhh.... I can&#39;t wait.... Letssssss Gooooooo
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaLooking pretty awesome!!!
HydiAICZq6IdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert Sean bean dies in this movie.<br>well atleast i assume so...
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaGREAT!! Now we know the whole fucking plot, we don&#39;t need to go to the theatre, thanks Warner Bros trailer makers! :/
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaStar wars rippoff

gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaChaning Tatum???!! kahahahahahahahaa no,no tnx!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita&quot;shut up Meg&quot;
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaso is Sean Bean gonna live through this ?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitawell.. thx for showing me the movie, its plot n all that before it even released... no need too go see this at the cinema anymore -_-
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSo...i&#39;m guessing Sean Bean dies in this?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaiw anna know...... does sean bean die. AGAIN
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWhen she said &quot; i do &quot; That was enough.. i jerked off
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler - Sean Bean dies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaA whole year delay. Producers killed that movie.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitasean bean will die in the 1st 10 minutes of the film..i bet haha
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaFrom the creators of Matrix Triology comes another mentally challenging movie... 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitachanning tatum = mugatu
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaNop, not ready yet to see another Dean&#39;s death...
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaso are they like the Anunnaki or somthin?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks too serious for a space adventure movie.<br><br>Where&#39;s the fun? Where are the quips? Why isn&#39;t the female lead more feisty and showing more levity about all the other characters and how stupidly serious they are towards the ridiculous notion of the Earth being seeded 100,000 years ago when everyone knows that is rubbish?<br><br>Dumb story, dumb characters, overly pretentious fáux seriousness and quite possibly the worse acting I have ever seen.<br><br>And yeah, casting SEAN MOTHER-FUCKING BEAN is the most unconvincing Alien ever because his YORKSHIRE ACCENT ruins any chance of the suspension of disbelief to actually work!!!<br><br>I hope Warner Brothers can get the money back from the Directors for the utter flop of a dogshit result this movie will be.<br><br>Metacritic will give it a 6.3, callin&#39; it first.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitawhere whan was THOR King Universe ??:D
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaPlease! Don&#39;t kill Sean Bean!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI really want those hover boots.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI predict: Sean Bean is gonna live!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert; Sean Bean dies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaOh goody Mr. Potato Head is in it...
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpiler alert: sean bean dies at the end
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSo the Illuminati wants to set Jupiter on fire to reveal the anti-Christ, I say go right ahead.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks pretty cool, Andy and Lana wachowski are the best
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQHKolIqBGs&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a>&quot;she loves dogs&quot;- I guess Brian 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaEven though this movie doesn&#39;t look that great, at least they&#39;ve finally released a trailer that actually explains what&#39;s going on in the movie. 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI was originally all for this movie, but the more I see of Channing Tatum, the more I realize I won&#39;t be able to watch it.  Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, and Eddie Redmayne doing a space opera with the Wachowskis?  Beauty!  I&#39;m there.  Channing Tatum?  No.  Can&#39;t do it.  He&#39;s useless and will ruin the whole film for me.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitalove the terra papers and robert morning sky my  friend,<br>my klan mother genetics<br>:karen
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitajawdaggw
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSigh ... same bad writing and conceptualization as usual.<br><br>1. Reptiles are random bad guys. Check<br>2. Humans are special in the universe. Check<br>3. Earth is special. Check<br>4. Disregarding evolution, which connects humans to all other life forms of Earth, even though this is sci-fi. Check!<br>5. Showing crop circles. Seriously?<br>6. Using the &quot;chosen one&quot; trope. Check.<br><br>Nice graphics, fine imagery, cool starships, and aliens that do not look like humans. Sadly, good design does not undo stupid writing and world building. Please try harder and get rid of dummy tropes that every author should know are bad writing.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to watch it because of the space ships...
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Sean Bean dies in this !
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitai cant imagine him playing a serious role.......he is the 22 jump street !!!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitapls nid stark dont die in the first 5 min of the movie 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaDESTINY: THE MOVIE
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitathis is nothing like THOR at all.......
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQHKolIqBGs&amp;t=0m26s">0:26</a> Too bad humans began to evolve around 200,000 years ago. These things are important Warner Bros!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSo these interlopers get seeded on earth 100,000 years ago and just wipe out the protohumans? I wish they&#39;d been less specific about that part. I mean, we have a discernible fossil record.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert : Sean Bean dies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThis is totally stolen from sailor moon, bit hey it still looks pretty cool. 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaobvious spoiler: sean bean dies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitasean bean dies?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it, Mila is pregnant right now isn&#39;t she? How is she working on this movie? Do they just take her face and make her body CGI?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWTF <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQHKolIqBGs&amp;t=0m11s">0:11</a> It&#39;s Bilbao! Finally they&#39;ve assumed that it&#39;s the capital city of the universe.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie...wrong actors..
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen this movie at least 12 times.  don&#39;t they makes this same bs every year?  damn it.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI cannot wait to go watch this at the theater&#39;s, AND then get high on the same day and watch it again.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaHI! Donations truly appreciated! Baby fund,  <a href="http://gofundme.com/fa3ldw">gofundme.com/fa3ldw</a>
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaShut up Meg
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitais this like an intergalactic version of game of thrones?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaDoes this sound like maybe a remake of DUNE????
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThe more than I see about this movie, the more I like it. It is an original picture, with no book to live up to....I will go see this opening night
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI bet Sean Bean dies in this movie.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitamy kind of movie, it&#39;s just a shame they cast actors and actresses who aren&#39;t all that great....channing tatum for instance......
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaIn real D 3D and in IMAX 3D
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita<b>SPOILER ALERT</b><br>Sean Bean dies in this movie.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert sean bean&#39;s character will die again
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaIts a flop.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaBrace yourselves<br>Game of Thrones comments are coming.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitanot really interesting to me ! seems like a copy of thor and star wars
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaLooks boring.. same old story.. save the planet.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaOh yes!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaNed &lt;3
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaUnderestimating the Wachowski&#39;s ha! I am hyping this.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the music ? Thank you in advance !
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like they collected every cliche they could think of and threw them all into one movie...
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaned stark?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaLet me guess, Sean Bean dies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI hated him beyond understanding in LesMis. But his performance in this movie looks to be amazing. Kinda want to watch this movie now.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThe Matrix seems farther and farther away. I hope they can pull it off but I am not holding my breath.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWow! I love this trailer, I hope the movie will be even better!!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks stupid to everyone here because it&#39;s not Marvel, a remake, or a movie based on 80s hasbro toys. They&#39;re a decade too early for this. Should have waited till everyone is sick of superhero movies.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty damn great! Except for that dog line, that was pretty dumb
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaname one movie Sean Bean did not die.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaShut up meg.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI saw Sean Bean, so that&#39;s one death confirmed.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think tatum was meant for fantasy/mystical creatures. I laughed the entire trailer. Well at least twilight will get a break. 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWhy the negative comments about this movie??
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI swear they used sounds from transformers 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI think me likes this. It&#39;s something different for a change. :)
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert...Sean Bean dies!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaMy guess Sean Bean dies 30 minutes into this film
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaUh....what&#39;s with everybody saying Sean Bean will die in this movie when nobody has even seen the movie yet? Also, the studio should pick some other 2015 date since SEVENTH SON also comes out in IMAX 3D on February 6th!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaSo... how will Sean Bean die in this one?
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaque filosofico. asi se demuestra que los  wachosky solo saben copiar de los comics
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI am still not sure whether or not this is going to be good, but... I&#39;ll see it. I think there is at least a chance it may be decent.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll have a pair of jet boots please.
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaIs this Destiny lol hahaha..
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaI bet Sean Bean dies in this movie 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaMila kunis and Tatum in a fictional planet/universe movie?!? What where they thinking? Spoiler alert: Sean will die!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaWinter is coming!
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQHKolIqBGs&amp;t=0m15s">0:15</a> Aegis Dynamics SC
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaBILBAO! ^^
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshita1. This looks rubbish <br>2. Mila Kunwhatever is a terrible actress, she cannot act.<br>3. The trailer gave away the entire plot and conclusion <br>4. Sean Bean will probably die...just saying. 
gQHKolIqBGsdelimeterByIshitaDogs? what the fuck...
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaIs anyone else still wondering why that guy is in the girls shower room..?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita2:01 they all must have said no homo
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna watch it and I dare say I did.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita&quot;I have a feeling we should kiss.&quot;
&quot;I sometimes have a feeling I can do Crystal Meth then I think, &#39;mmm. Better not.&#39;&quot;

Rebel Wilson is perfect.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39; already obsessed with this movie!! :)
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaOmg fat Amy is so funny she&#39;s the only reason I want to watch this movie.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even know how many times I&#39;ve watched this trailer. haha also does anyone know when it&#39;s going to be released in Australia? 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI already know I&#39;m gonna come out the the theatre singing
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaahahahahaaa............whoever wrote the lines for fat amy is a fricking genius!!! seriously!!!!!!!!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaso much login for fat amyyy :&#39;)
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Hey Amy&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ve just been shot&quot;
OMG can&#39;t stop laughing
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Fire away dude.&quot;
Take off hat.
&quot;Oh... Not a dude...&quot;
hilarious! :)
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaYup, this movie will consume my month....
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaThis is not a remake of Glee. Every single noise is coming out of their mouths. Glee has music playing for them while they sing.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaOMG  :O RE-MAKE OF GLEE ^^ 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaMy kind of people right here. Jess looks adorable and fat amy cracks me up!

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaPitch slap... Not bitch slap...idiot...
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaJessica looks so bad ass
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaRebel Wilson! Watch her Wedge or Bogan Pride clips, they&#39;re hysterical.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaRebel Wilson &lt;3
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaPitch Perfect = acapella (no instruments, focus on music). Glee = show choir (uses instruments focus on &quot;show&quot;). Pitch Perfect is a film version of NBC&#39;s the Sing Off. Go look it up, it&#39;s awesome. 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaFat Amy = Jonah Hill 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaCant. Wait. Skylar. Fucking. Astin.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaIts like glee, only its a movie -_- Couldnt they even make some different scenario other than &quot;busting&quot; her in the shower *Cough* finn-mr.shue.... 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaGlee.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaRebel Wilson &gt; Anything else that has ever made me laugh
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaAmy montage- 0:26 1:20 1:30 2:04 2:10 2:16 2:20
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita0:11
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaThen wait for the dvd
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie is the reason season three of Workaholics has been delayed until January, (Which it probably is.), I will kill someone.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like an awesome movie.My girls will love this!I do.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaGo to the app store and download &quot;app trailers&quot; then type the code &quot;treeyoyo&quot; YOU WILL RECIVE 50,000 points = $50!!!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaNo, what I&#39;m saying is I didn&#39;t care for Step Up.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaid watch it just cuz it seems funny and hell yea ill tell everyone
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaStep Up is not a bad movie it&#39;s a movie about people Stepping up for what they believed in and the storyline is awesome( this movie is good too but i don&#39;t see anything new in rip off and using word like bitch slap and crystal meth are not clever...)
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaSo you&#39;re saying that all these professional dancers choreography sucks in the Step up movies and who do you think choreographed these little dance scenes in this movie.  
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita2:20. Oh my God, yes.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitai soom times have the feaking i can do crystal meth but then i think i better not
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaYeah this looks decent im not watching this shit but while step up lacks in story makes up for the dancing and after watching glee this might not surprise you with anything new so eh
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaSort of, except, you know, Step Up sucks.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI WANNA WATCH IT SOOO BADLYYYy! &lt;3 omggggggggggg
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaDuh doy!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitashe would be a supporting actress...and not likely winning any awards.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaJonah Hill is playing Fat Amy right?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshita...So is this regionals? 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s step up with music?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaA part of me says WTF, but the other parts really WANTS to watch this. 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitathis actually looks funny lol
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaActually, it&#39;s Skylar Astin :) Loved him as Georg, can&#39;t wait to see him as Jesse!

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaHeh,
The director is the director of Avenue Q,
Just made it an insta-watch.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaSKYLER AUSTIN&lt;3
SA moment, anyone?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitalol, i&#39;d watch this just for Fat Amy.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI gotta see Fat Amy.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks sort of okay. 
At least the music will be pretty good. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna pay to see it in theaters, I&#39;ll probably wait till I can rent it.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaTwo things about the trailer I had a little laugh/noticed. 

1) Reminds me of a chick version of Fired Up!

2) The bit where she said &quot;nothing on here from this century&quot; kind of shows what todays music is. Absolute shit lol
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitalol. right round - flo rida. or right round - dope. the second one is better in my opinion
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaAdam Devine makes me want to see this movie
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaDa Fuq?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually legit excited to see this! I hope it&#39;s as good as it seems.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t that Vassar? :D

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks freaking wonderful.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaBrittany Snow!

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitauh... no.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaWorkaholicss yeeeeeeeeeee
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaWell put ahah
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaStep Up and You Got Served are idiotic hiphop dance movies. The storylines are generic as hell and the dialogue is really lame. This is competitive vocal music, a territory completely unexplored except by Glee and it has extremely clever dialogue just in the dialogue. I don&#39;t see the correlation?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitago get Nellie Veitenheimer if ever theres a part 2 movie or next of this.. She&#39;s a market and Shanna Henderson too.. ^_^
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitawhen is the soundtrack being released?
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song that plays from 1:15 to 1:20??? 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called no diggity by the blackstreeet
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song at  1:42 - 1:57  ,love that song ! 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaLolol this lookin relll funny jed. I wannna seee itt!!!!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitalol the soundtrack is gonna be amazing
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this for some reason.

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI JUST BEEN SHOT ! LOL 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaYAAAAAAAAAY 
This movie premieres one day after my birthday what means I&#39;m going to watch it with my friends!
Now that&#39;s going to be a memorable birthday!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaGlee: The College Years
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so frickin&#39; hilarious...and I&#39;m still hoping to see a combination of &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;Bring It On&quot; and &quot;Step Up&quot; being mixed into a movie anyway. Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson are my main ones to see this movie anyway.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaGlee the movie? :D
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI agree....

8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaSlylar Astin&#39;s in this!!! I love him!, mainly for being georg in spring awakening...
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaOh my goodness Amy is so hilarious!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaWho sings this version of no diggity??
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaUmmm... No ! As much as i Love Anna Kendrick... Just NO!!!! 
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaNo diggity... No doubt.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaI imagine when I die, I&#39;ll find this movie playing on repeat in the waiting room of Hell.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaRebel Wilson!
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitaNah, Glee&#39;s not a cappella.
8dItOM6eYXYdelimeterByIshitathis is the white equivalent of stomp the yard

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita might just watch this with my cock out. look jerk worthy
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitait looks slightly retarded...i mean i get that the Snyder loves his movies over-stylized but this shit just looks ridiculous.

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitayeah it may be a random mix of a lot of different movie icons, zombies, ninjas, samurai yada yada yada, but people fail to realize its zack snydey directing this movie. every movie he has made has been great, and better then the one before.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaLOL there in like a prison and they still had all of the make up and crap to keep them looking like that lol,this look kind of silly

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitashut the fuck up people. if you actually listen to the trailer it explains everything. don&#39;t be a fucking hater. if you dont like it stfu. but it seems cool.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaPuberty.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitathis would be cooler, if it wernt about women power...
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaOOOOHHHH OMG

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaMaybe she is insane, then in the movie she woke up realized all was a dream. lol cool gig. Why hot girls in insane place? fuck them as long as they are good looking.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaAnime+Otaku+A good blunt(Rex perferably)= Sucker Punch AWESOME!

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t think of what else this movie needs. Looks like a perfect movie. :)
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@orknomad Huh, Have you seen it?
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@theresistance2018 cheers..
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitathe escapist meets cinderella meets sin city meets some fucked up shit

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitabe nice if it was r rated, a little nudity, tarentino style, but looks good anyway.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@Delta621000  the silversun pickups panic switch

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaWhich Music is it in : 1:00 - 1:12
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaInternational Treasure Vs Inception?
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT LED ZEPPELIN
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the last song?
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@VAVEDIN There are some indications that the World War I soliders the girls fight are, in fact, zombies or zombie-like creatures.  The writer/director did sort of pack every single cool geeky thing into one movie.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@kutedoofiy They both have a &quot;live action anime&quot; vibe to them, this more than Scott Pilgrim, but both have it.  Although Sucker Punch seems to have a &quot;real world&quot; that&#39;s close to our world (albeit it one where such a thing as an insane asylum/brothel combo could exist) and a seperate fantasy world, while Scott Pilgrim had a &quot;real world&quot; that is nothing like the actual real world.
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@miniliv99 not at all...im freaking psyched to see this!!!
9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita@miniliv99 very much so

9k10AzCcMOMdelimeterByIshita予告だけ見ると面白そうだけど、それだけで終わりそう。

1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitawow amazing !!!
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaidol ko kasi yung babaeng naka uniform kala ko sya yung heroine yun pala na infect sya :@
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaI was sad because the main actor, Gong Yoo, died. I was sad because he&#39;s soo hot and he died.haha. Not a good move by the writers if they want viewers to go out of the cinema with smiles on their faces. <br><br>Dear amazing WRITERS of this movie, please do a part 2 and resurrect Gong Yoo. It&#39;s possible. You can cure him from being a zombie. Falling from the train can cause some fractures but hey,  that wasn&#39;t really high. People can still survive from it. You have to do it again with Gong Yoo in it. You have to cure the pain a lot of us have felt after watching the movie. That&#39;s the only way.
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie. Can&#39;t see any zombie movies nowadays that brings a tear to my eye.
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up for this movie
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaive watched it and it was totally 1000000% the best
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaAmazing..the zombie thing is cliche but how the story goes, where it happened, how it came about and how it ends, they&#39;re all original...?A must see movie!!

1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitakabaneri of the iron fortress :D
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitano guns in asia , wonder how they fight zombies
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaKabaneri of The Iron Fortress Live Action : The beginning
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaBeyond being an effective scare movie, it shows how humans themselves can turn against each other. There&#39;s a scene in the movie we particularly like. Let us know if you have seen it in any movie: The lead actor looks up to watch zombies hanging from a helicopter, which is trying to shake off the zombies who fall from a great height, right in front of the lead actor. Their bodies hit the cement hard but (it looked like a continuous shot without cuts), they stand up to run after him instantly. That was a great, amazing shot, something we haven&#39;t seen before. Seeing that, the horror escalates and you wonder if there&#39;s an escape.
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaအဲ့မင္းသားကိုအရမ္းၾကိဳက္တာေလ ၾကည့္ခ်င္လိုက္တာ
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this so bad! I love zombie movies!

1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaWWZ Asian Editon
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaI DO NOT LIKE THE ENDING TO THE MOVIE, for the sake of everyone who haven&#39;t watched it I&#39;m not gonna say anything
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaLOL They definitely stole this idea from WORLD WAR Z and SNOWPIERCER, c&#39;mon Korea, really.
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaA good cast + a good plot = an awesome movie
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaSo realistic ... the lead actor always manages to have his hairstyle intact throughout the movie ..
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaWORLD WAR Z TRAIN OF BUSAN
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaThis seems actually really good! I&#39;ve never expected that South Korea would make a zombie movie which is as good as those Hollywood makes.
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!
1ovgxN2VWNcdelimeterByIshitaI hope they&#39;ll play BTS Run when zombies runs 😂

nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaYouTube comments always cracks me up... one person says one thing, EVERYONE just repeats it. We got it, it&#39;s a remake of an old movie meeting a new movie
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaFor those wondering why the ending transition/theme doesn&#39;t match with the rest of the trailer. The final version of this trailer has a typo with the release date of October 12th :O
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGal is so beautiful
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaMr and Mrs. Smith 2016 meets the neighbors. How original
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitawoah Zach looks skinnier
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitathere is a comic called keeping up with the Joneses
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitai just love when trailers tell off 80% of the plot.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitathis is like mr. mrs.&#39;s smith but kinda backwords
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitasuperman wonderwoman as Neighbours.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was gonna be a show about the Jonas brothers tbh 😂😂😂
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if Isla Fisher wil be back at the NOW YOU SEE ME franchise movie... maybe at 3? <br><br>any info guys?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing us the entire movie, trailers these days smh
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitathis &#39;&#39;déjà vu &#39;  movie hollywood need to do somthing new
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitada duck happened to zach yo
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaJon Ham was actually highly sought after for the batman role. Coincidence that he ends up in a film with wonder woman.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaAnything with &quot;keeping up with..&quot; I automatically judge negativity...but this looks fkn awesome!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitahonestly Isla fisher is pretty but gal gadot is regal
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaHey it&#39;s Gal 😍
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one that thought this was a sequel to the other Joneses movie out a while back about the family that has everything and markets and sells it to get rich ?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaJabComix anyone?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIs the clip of Galifianakis yelling into his tie a blooper? It looks like Fisher is breaking character
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot is a beauty <b>_</b>
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI just want to see Gal. That&#39;s all i need.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIs this in the same cinematic universe as The Smiths?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI think I would rather keep up with the Henry Jonses instead
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot is so beautiful....
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitawasnt there a movie like this but instead of being spies the neighbours were salesmen?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaTHANKS FOR GIVING AWAY THE PLOT, YOU GUYS ARE SO GOOD AT THAT.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThis took a turn..
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaDon Draper and Wonder Woman are the new Mr. Mrs. Smith
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaAwesome cast.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitawhen you see the full movie in just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPfYXXg65qA&amp;t=2m30s">2:30</a> minuts﻿
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThis whole time I thought the jones were the bad guys but thanks to this terrific trailer I now know that they are the good guys so I won&#39;t have to spend the first half of the movie getting fooled and falling for the twist ending
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPfYXXg65qA&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPfYXXg65qA&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> favorite part 😂😂😂
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPfYXXg65qA&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> the one thing I didn&#39;t expect 😂😂😂
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaJohn hamm is archer sterling
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know that the Amazonian Princess had another secret life?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaZack got so skinny!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot looks very sexy in lingerie
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Mr. Drapers found a new line of work.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaYeah, so Mr &amp; Mrs Smith from the lame neighbours&#39; perspective? I&#39;m down.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIf Gal Gadot&#39;s in, Im in
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaAwww..they just shown the entire movie.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitacouldnt tell that was Zach at first lol
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaomg I love wonderwoman
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshita( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitathat was actually funny
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song towards the end of the trailer?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaDude, she&#39;s too tall!!!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaDiet Zak Galifianakis
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaAnybody got that mr and mrs smith vibe
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI am so disappointed in Jon Hamm<br>He&#39;s better than this.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThe Joneses are more interesting than the Kardashians.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThe Burbs meets Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith <br><br>looks good to me
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t think &quot;trailers&quot; are suppose to spoil the entire movie, for example: now we know that the Joneses aren&#39;t regular neighbors and there&#39;s going to be real issues...why should I give you my money? idk i just feel that there are better ways to getting people to hit the theater..nowadays trailers show you everything, including free clips of movie scenes on the internet? are you serious? and definitely don&#39;t go out if you see the same movie ad on most videos you watch on youtube..you technically watched the movie 1000000 times
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaMy bae Gal is in this so it&#39;s instantly a must watch
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitathis looks and feels like a movie that would&#39;ve came out around 2004 - 2006 lol.. anyone else?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaLmao so it&#39;s mr and Mrs. Smith from the neighbors point of view xD
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWow, great! I love it when trailers spoil all the plot twists and reveals! Saves me a lot of money for movie tickets.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaBobby Lee!!!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good, I just think they revealed too much, part of the trailer has us wondering &#39;who they are&#39; do they have villainous motives etc, and then we get info their spies and covert operatives who they help. I rather the trailer kept some guess if they were going to be allied spies or villains.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaHILARIOUS! Gal Gadot looking awesome. As always
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaTrailer gave away too much
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI had to type all the way to the letter J before Youtube figured out I was not looking for Keeping up with the Kardashians episodes.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaSo what is the music behind this video? If anyone has any clue and care to share
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaNoooooo, why you lost weight dude...dont like it
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWow enjoyed this movie! Bravo! It was short and sweet too 😑😑
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPfYXXg65qA&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a>, Boinge, Boinge!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitais this a sequel or reboot?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWell thanks for the trailer, now I don&#39;t need to see the movie to find out what happens...
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll wait until it comes out on video on demand!😒
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve seen this film back in the early 2000&#39;s but it stared Bruce Willis.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGlad I don&#39;t have to waste any time on this movie since the entire plot was given away in the trailer. Thanks I guess...
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaZach Galifianakis looks a lot like Mark Hamill, in this movie.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought that it was Kim Kardashian on the picture before you open this video.... it turned out Gal Gadot
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIsla Fisher marries Zack Galfianakis? Um... no. Hamm and Gadot, sure, but Zack and Isla? I mean, I can only suspend disbelief so much.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaFeel like I just watched the whole movie. Thanks for saving me cash 20th Century Fox!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaso kind of mr and mrs smith from tge neighbors perspective
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like i&#39;ve watched whole movie!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaWoo
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaGal Gadot look great and beautiful &lt;3
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaSo is it the 12th or the 21st?
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaThey are just trying to cash in on the name of the 1913 comic strip. :P (I&#39;m kidding I don&#39;t think anyone remembers that.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaLooks hysterical! Love Zach Galifinakis and even met him. But this trailer showed a bit too much... Should&#39;ve ended with them leaving the secret room.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaI lost it when he yelled at his tie.. haha
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaMr. and Mrs. Smith 2: Meet the Neighbours.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaLooks so much more fun than watching KUWTK&#39;s boring asses.
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaPhew!! I thought it was the keeping up with the Kardashians movie...
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaso gotta watch this
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaKUWTK hahahaha
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaIsla and Gal...  Count me in!
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaDiana is so hot... I&#39;m doing her in Justice League
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaActually that&#39;s the trailer for my solo movie
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaUnder 200 views
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaFirst
nPfYXXg65qAdelimeterByIshitaKiss your boring suburban life goodbye. Watch the new trailer for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JonesesMovie">#JonesesMovie</a>, in theaters October 21.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis is not how the story goes in book... they changed the plot. Waaahh! They&#39;re together when the accident happened and Travis is the one whose driving the car. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Freakout">#Freakout</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23spoileralert">#spoileralert</a>
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaBoooo it&#39;s the same story over and over. when is Nicholas Sparks going to write something original. He gets paid to just change the names and rewrite the same garbage.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI think this movie is gonna flop big time. I mean Alexandra Daddario and Tom Welling playing support to no names? I don&#39;t know why the producers chose Teresa Palmer. She might be the ugliest most talentless lead of all Sparks movies. Super overrated bitch. She must stay at home and take care of her son instead.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI like the song of Sia for this movie! :)
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitawhat is this song called??
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI want to see this. <br>And Clark Kent from small vile is in the movie. I was wondering what he has been up to lately. 
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaexcuse me who is this artits son tel me name from  she   please
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis can&#39;t happen in real life man delusional shit.  Wheres the old movie style that was way ago damn
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaAnother trailer that basically shows us the whole movie.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve seen this before. Oh yeah, every story by Nicholas Sparks is the same.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThe Choice is one of my fave books of Sparks. I was waiting for this. How Travis stayed to his wife. However, the way they twisted the story, I am truly disappointed.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaPlzz can anyone tell me the name of the first song and name of the singer (Male)  played in the trailer?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitauhm.... wrong guy for Travis... Tom should&#39;ve been Travis!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis movie should be called <b>The Cliche</b>.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSmallville fans??
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitasoo cute!! Can&#39;t wait!! 😍😍
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaanyone who is actually looking forward to this has a shit taste in movies and don&#39;t say I don&#39;t like romance films because I do, real romance like roman holiday, sabrina, casablanca, meet joe black, Jerry maguire, etc the list goes on
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaBackground music titles please!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSeriously, why is crap like this made?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitawhats the first song that plays? 😍
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWhats the 2nd song ?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshita&quot;becoz you bother me&quot;
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaPfff!!! Can&#39;t you make a trailer without spoiling all the movie? You just made us not needing to watch the movie anymore! Idiots!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so terrible .
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so terrible .
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaAmm, another movie with straight protagonists? <br>I&#39;m not heterophobic, I have straight friends, but this is enough.<br>I don&#39;t want little kids to grow up thinking that this cheating and crazy lifestyle is the way to live.<br>If straight people really want to be respected they need to start making movies that aren&#39;t about white and ridiculous love triangles that always end up psychologically controlling the girl.<br>Also, why do heteros always put the whole movie in the trailer? Lol
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody knows the names of the songs that plays in this trailer?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I&#39;m not selling this is cuz of Teresa Palmer and Alex Daddario
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaLove triangle, check, tragic accident, check, predictable plot, check
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThank you so much Dennis Zhang!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaOMG....like we did not cry enough with &quot;the best of me&quot; here comes another one where it does not seem like there will be a happy ending to this story....why are they doing this to us!!!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitamight go see this awful movie just for Benjamin Walker... and then go see him on Broadway 1 month later
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSuggest a better guy to be Travis : comment
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitawow Benjamin Walker looks like a younger liam neeson in this movie
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaDAMN, superman got fat
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaIs this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? The tone of the trailer keeps changing. It seems that they&#39;re either trying for comedy but it&#39;s not that funny or trying for drama but it comes off corny..
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis is literally a summary of the movie. I need someone to explain what &quot;Teaser Trailer&quot; means, I dont think it means what I think it means anymore.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitatitle of the first song?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSo you are with a doctor who is super hot and superman and you cheating on him with with this dude weird movie !!! :/
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaAll those who are saying this guy isn&#39;t gorgeous or whatever crap, well, I think he makes a perfect Travis and is incredibly handsome!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know what the first song in the trailer is called?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitawhats the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWPM1jTnuuo&amp;t=0m31s">0:31</a>?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaMy favourite Sparks book. So excited for the movie.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaholy fuck i wanna throw up
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaTom Welling should fly backwards in time and stop this movie from happening.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one that feels that Tom Welling should&#39;ve been the lead role and not the other way around?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshita&quot;SHE LEFT, BECAUSE OF YOU&quot; <b>Superman punches Abraham Lincoln in the face</b> hahahaahahahabsbwnehi2osxnfheio3dnhdeoeebddiei
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaCan we stop making trailers that make me feel like I&#39;ve watch the entire film in three minutes?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitawow collider sent me to this, and they weren&#39;t kidding when they said this&#39;ll make you laugh out loud....
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaGAHBAGE
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t mess with Superman
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI predict this film will sweep the 2017 Razzies.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaColliderVideos brought me here.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaOh cool I love Lifetime Movies!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis movies ruins the book, i imagined travis being young attractive and fit and gabby a hot girl but this cast sucks, tom welling should&#39;ve been travis.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThe trailer alone made me cry 😩😩😩
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSam Smith - Like I Can
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis makes me feel like there is no hope for humanity! What utter garbage!!!!!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaQuestion: Why is it every &quot;love story&quot; movie for a woman this guy creates has to involve cheating on a boyfriend? Sparks does realize that you can have a love story with drama that is interesting and there be no cheating right? Hell even the huge &quot;Notebook&quot; had cheating on Cyclops the military hero boyfriend. LAME.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWho the fuck watches these movies?!?! This looks like shit!!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a sucker for rom coms, but it seems I&#39;ve already seen the entire movie. Fucking trailers these days. Either way, much cringe.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWPM1jTnuuo&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> That was the lamest punch i have ever seen in my life, WTF was that.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWPM1jTnuuo&amp;t=1m52s">1:52</a>
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI this a comedy? Because this trailer is hilarious.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA........Why? Just why?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaNotebook 4.0
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWhat song are they playing?!?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI think that it looks good. And for those that put it down and think it looks &quot;absolutely atrocious&quot; then don&#39;t watch it and keep your god awful opinions to your self. Thanks :)
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaam I the only one who watch this just to see Alexandra Daddario ?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaLooks like another shitty adaptation with beautiful people, lots of make-up and no feeling. I enjoyed the book although Travis is so perfect
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThe actor playing Travis doesnt look atrractive or appealing.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaMI LIBRO FAVORITO!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitathey made Tom look really old and fat.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaFinally!! My much anticipated film adaptation from Sparks. :) I can&#39;t wait to see this because this was the first novel I&#39;ve ever read from him and made me cry a river.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaCan we talk about Maggie Grace&#39;s terrible wig? <br>What the hell.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWell i want to watch it because of Tom Welling
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis looks absolutely atrocious.Like most Nicolas Sparks adaptations.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like the male actor
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitais there an actual point to this movie besides a poor white girl who can&#39;t decide between a guy with abs and a doctor?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitais there an actual point to this movie besides a poor white girl who can&#39;t decide between a guy with abs and a doctor?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWanna watch this just because of Teresa Palmer and Alexandria Daddario.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitathat was the lamest punch in the history of lame punches
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSeems like Nicholos Sparks killed another character in this movie too
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaTHE CHOICE IS MY FAVOURITE NS BOOK AND I AM SO AFRAID THEY&#39;RE GOING TO RUIN IT LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. (tbh the notebook, dear john and the longest ride movies were really good lol)
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaThis is like some cosmic singularity where everything Nicholas Sparks-ish has been drawn into one trailer.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaso bland.. this sparks guy is just so untalented it&#39;s ridiculous. the notebook was literally his life changer. please stop farting shitty movies, please!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaTeresa palmer! Love her
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaHumm.. Parece que eu assisti  o filme todo nesse trailer!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaSpay and neuter your pets, folks. It could save a HUMAN LIFE
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaComo se llaman las canciones??
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaLove Teresa and Benjamin! Looks great!!
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaIs the actress that is his sister (brunette hair) wearing a wig? In her first scene in this trailer it looks like it...
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to see this
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaWow. I think I just saw the whole movie in that trailer.
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaanyone knows what&#39;s the last soundtrack is?
nWPM1jTnuuodelimeterByIshitaYa quiero que salga!!! Me encanta los libros de Nicholas Sparks!

FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Plainview is Ubermensch.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThere <i>will be blood... at the Academy Awards!</i>
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaGood god!  There are too many awesome movies!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaexcellent! brilliant!! mas-ter-pie-ce!!! best DDLewis performance!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaOnly on Netflix until midnight tonight!!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaIt fucking kills me how DDL does a movie once in a blue moon but when he does he gets an Oscar😄
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThe greatest daniel day lewis performance.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitawhats the soundtrack in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeSLPELpMeM&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> called
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie... Jesus Christ
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitajust watched it yesterday for the 12th time
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThese ppl... in which u r one of them..
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaholy shit is this a great trailer. doesnt reveal too much, catches the tone of the movie perfectly and is intriguing on its own.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThe speech in the movie / trailer was improvised. How many people knew that !
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaTravesty that Paul Dano wasn&#39;t nominated for an Oscar for his role.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite films and one of the greatest trailers ever.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitais this the best movie ever made ?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaWhat is so creepy about this movie? I don&#39;t get it. I watch it like a drama and thought that the guy with the mustache is very good because in the half time of the movie where I&#39;m only starting to realize that is DDL. LOL my fav actors from My Left Foot.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitatrailer is NOT nearly as good as the actually film, plainview is literally satan
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitamasterpiece
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaHi Lachlan&#39;s friends
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaone of the greatest movies ever made
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI honestly believe this is the greatest movie ever made.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see Paul Thomas Anderson working with Daniel Day Lewis again next year.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis and no country for old men are some of my favourite films, anyone get other recommendations? Seen road to perdition, true grit, and millers crossing are great as well.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie so overrated....I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching it
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaPeaky blinders
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaTHERE WILL BE BLOOD<br>hand off to Daniel Day-Lewis
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshita&quot;With these... people.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m almost certain Mr. Plainview wanted to call them something else.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitawhats the music they were playing near the end
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaNobody talks about Paul Dano being great in this movie
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaHaters gonna hate. This is my number 1 movie of all time.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Plainview&quot; is precisely how I would describe this movie.  I&#39;m a movie buff, and I can say this is definitely one of the most overrated (an understatement) movies of all time.  The most average western I&#39;ve ever seen in my life (and I&#39;ve seen ALOT) and totally undeserving of such praise.  I&#39;m beginning to wonder if more than half the people who praise this movie as a masterpiece do so because critics say it is, and how much money critics were paid to almost unanimously praise it as &quot;one of the best films of the decade&quot; (my ass).  Angel Heart, now that&#39;s a movie that deserves this movie&#39;s praise.  The confrontations with the false preacher would be one of the few interesting things about this movie.  Otherwise, I rate it 5/10
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI made a goddamn delicious snickers/vanilla blend ice-cream after this movie.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaFilms have got to stop spoiling the whole thing in the title, smh
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like a horror movie where the monster&#39;s the main character.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie does something to me that no other movie I&#39;ve ever seen does. It&#39;s disturbing and hilarious and full of truth about very bad things.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitayou are a bastard from a basket..what a dialouge! brillient movie!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathe damn title is a spoiler...
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaShit movie. Can&#39;t believe this was so hyped up years back.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitagreat trailer
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaDid not like this strange movie.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThere will be Daniel Day Lewis
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaAn undoubtedly Classic trailer
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaIs this based on Rockefeller family like it really was? Or a fictional story?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaWhere can i buy a coat like at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeSLPELpMeM&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a>? And how its called?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaFinally, a trailer that does the movie justice without spoilers.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaA great movie centered around 2 villains. The only question is which villain is worse?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaDaniel&#39;s business was his religion, and Eli&#39;s religion was his business.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathe ending of the trailer is awesome. we know why we laugh.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitamay be good acting by D Day Lewis, but the story is dark all the same, how the drive for oil and money corrupts the soul to the point that even murder is nothing...., and as for religion and God, it is derided and made into a caricature. So yeah good acting skills,  but not a movie to lift up and warm.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaMy milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaAs much as I love this movie, I would&#39;ve loved to see Philip Seymour Hoffman play the character of Eli Sunday
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathe most overrated film ever. it sucks !
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathis guy is fucking awesome ,what a talent ,gifted artist ........daniel ..
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI am a 17-year-old boy who loves movies. I&#39;ve seen many great movies during my 17 years of life and today I saw There will be blood for the first time in my life. I have never seen anything like this movie. A masterpiece. A pure work of art.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathis, the third man or bertoluccis il conformista is my favourite movie of all time! undoubtedly the best film in the past 35 years. trailer gives me chills everytime!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI wish the trailer of SwoleDip had a better quality
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaMasterclass from Daniel Day-Lewis. Best Performance ive ever seen in a Movie.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaRidiculous. Absolute monstrosity, and travesty all rolled into one horrible film full of lies and propaganda. <br><br>Let me assure you fine people here today that I&#39;am indeed a very warm and caring person. I just prefer to be filthy rich while doing so. Thank you very much for your time.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaAlso this movie slightly felt like Citizen Kane
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaNot satisfied with the finale and hugely disappointed with Daniel and Eli&#39;s entire final conversation. Everything before that point was golden though. And PTA should get another scorer. This film is not better than Boogie, but better than Hard, Magnolia, Punch &amp; Master. I&#39;ve yet to see Inherent
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaDRAMA HORSESHIT
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitabrilliant film, interesting throughout, great acting, top class script &amp; directing
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaPerfect movie. The only movie I&#39;ve ever seen that I would give a 10/10.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaGreat acting.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaSeriously I think this is the best perfomance ever
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaMeh it was alright. Too much over acting
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI believe I&#39;m about halfway thru this movie on Netflix. So far it&#39;s not good at all.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitagreat movie <br>9/10
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the dumbest movies
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaAt this point I stand to refer to Paul Dano as the one man punching bag of cinema. Why? Because it seems like every role he&#39;s in, he gets the living crap beaten out of him. Prisoners, Cowboys and Aliens, 12 Years A Slave, Knight and Day, Looper, There Will Be Blood, the list goes on.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaWithin two minutes of the film I&#39;m hooked because the film-making is so god damn interesting.<br><br>But I took a long time to finally watch the movie because these trailers are literally repellent for new viewers. It makes the movie look simply boring, when really it&#39;s vastly interesting.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaHow the hell did No country for old men beat this for best picture? I mean it&#39;s a great film but this trumps it in every way
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaWhat an un-nervy get trailer! Got 25 mins into the film and was really enjoying it and than it got taken off Netflix! I&#39;m gonna try and buy it
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaIs there blood?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaGod damn brilliant film...
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshita&quot;I can&#39;t keep doing this on my own...with these...hmm.... people&quot; -&gt; he tells he IS The Devil !<br><br>Awesome performance !
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaKinda reminded me of &quot;Children of the Corn&quot; a bit.  Not the plot, just the creepiness.  Good acting, but creepy and depressing story.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaNaff title, brilliant film.<br><br>It should have been titled &quot;Oil!&quot; like the Upton Sinclair novel it was  based upon...
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaLol this movie was the weirdest movie I ever seen...the ending had me laughing. He was crazy why did he randomly kill pastor for no reason. I was thinking it woulda been even more epic if it was the other way around
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best trailer in the history of cinema.  As great as the film was, it was a bit of a let-down after seeing this trailer.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaAnd goddamnn, that Jonny Greenwood!
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaIn any ones top ten of films.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathis movie should be called there will be milkshakes
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think this film is so much a storyteller as it is a display of character transformation. How DDL&#39;s (and Dano&#39;s) character transforms from being ambitious to greedy and callous. I don&#39;t think any trailer could&#39;ve done this movie justice.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaYezzus told me to like this movie!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌😎
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaamericans are experience their own set of sarcasm
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaKanye 
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaHERE CAUSE OF KANYE
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathe trailer doesn&#39;t do justice to the movie at all
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t keep doing this on my own, with these.........people (ahaha)
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaJust finished writing a whole term paper about it... :)
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaEven after watching the movie time and time again, the trailer still gives me chills.<br>Amazing movie, on my top ten.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitathis guy used my line..
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaWatched about 30 times since 2008, best movie ever.
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitawtf?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaHow many people actually watched it for the end?
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaVery relevant to how our sick society works today. (on a serious tone, no sarcasm)
FeSLPELpMeMdelimeterByIshitaThis was an instant classic
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaTil&#39; this day nothing can beat the first Ice Age movie

Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaKinda looks like garbage.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaYES! Buck!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI have to see this movie, I love that Buck is back. He is my favorite !
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitathis franchise is as dead as the Fine Bros
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaLove ice age what a fun film this looks plz can you check my channel out
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaThis franchise is a big part of my childhood. I always saw them 3 times in the theaters
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to this movie
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWow, the jokes are already corny as f*ck, not to mention most characters have been flanderized beyond belief and the premise is as cliched as you can get here. I swear the writers have jumped the shark with this Ice Age project.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaAhahha dope vid... Ehi youtube i&#39;m trying to reach 1000 subs, would be great to have your help, I am a painter but not a regular one... Check my channel to find more ;)
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaAAHH OMG BUCK!!!<br>YASSSSS THAT MADE ME SMILE SEEING HE&#39;S BACK WOOOO
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaOMG XD
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaahh sorry. and the humans (part1) where?? please reply 20th century fox! :(
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitai dont think this movie will click the first one is the best among the rest!..
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaLove it!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitawhy does Diego suddenly have brown eyes, are´nt they suppose to be green??
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitasoo excitinggggg !!!!!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIt looks like the best but a few characters are not here from 4
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIts nice that Buck is back and all, but no Rudy?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaLooks fun all the way. :-)
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitawhat is sound name?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI got sick and tired from ice age already!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhat about granny&#39;s pet whale
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaTrailer is not interesting ... Please, we&#39;ve very high expectations...
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhat is the song?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaLeuk hee
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI personally love this movies hope they continue the series up to 8. But it also depends on the voice actor, the money stocks they gain and etc. Plus they need to cover certain stuff still like:<br>1. Sid needs a girlfriend/mate<br>2. Shira and Diego need to have cubs ( they should have added the cubs in this one but hope they show them in Ice Age 6, 7, or 8)<br>3. Scrat should be able to join the herd ( I know it may seem impossible but at least let them try)<br>4. Where is Peaches little mole friend in this movie?<br>5. How the heck did Buck get there? How he got he&#39;s knife back? ( The pirates had Buck&#39;s knife last in Ice Age 4)<br>6. Let&#39;s see how will the herd pull it off on the meteor crash. I bet the only one that can do something is Scrat cause somehow he can solve big catastrophe.<br><br>BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME R 2, 5 and 6. PLUS MAKE MORE ICE AGE! ICE AGE 6, ICE AGE 7, AND ICE AGE 8! MY MONEY IS WAITING!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI will laugh at the people who think this movie is going to be bad but it turns out to be good
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaYou know what it would make it better for me. For that baby from the first movie to show up all grown up.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaBuck is back, yooooohooooo
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitathe female sorry i dont no (hungary) not from ice age 1?!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaYeah, screw this movie.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaOk. So I guess no aliens but a natural disaster like what supposedly killed dinos..ok....still dont want this but ok....
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaThe ice age movies were always hit and miss for me. i liked the first,thought the second was good but not as good as it could of been, third was meh and i didn&#39;t even try wit the forth. This one actually looks good and im glad they brought back Buck who i thought was the best part of the third one.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaDid they really just choose that song for the trailer? most overused song ever lol
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitathis is becoming boring same as the Fast and Furious series ,,
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshita&quot;Meteor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shower?&quot;<br><br>That joke is so bad, I was cringed to it
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been really hoping since the 2nd movie that they make a movie about Manny and the crew finding the baby from the 1st movie as an adult... there could be a beautiful movie made as emotional as the original that&#39;s something that I think was completely left out in the sequels... anyone else?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaAfter a terrible fourth comes a horrific fifth! That&#39;s money for you!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Louis???
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m hyped for this movie!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaFrom the creators of Rio 2 and The Peanuts Movie..................
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaHilarious.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaGoodness, if you pause precisely at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohq6NmKMja8&amp;t=1m54s">1:54</a>, it looks as if a jolt of electricity has struck Julian!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitathe real question is where are the humans?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIce Age 1 was a classic, a one off.<br>I dont think it needed 5 films.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhoaa, This is odd.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhy do you keep making these?! You can do better than this Blue Sky! Peanuts was a WAY better film! You guys are capable of good movies!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaAccording to their own canon, Humans are evolving around this
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhat we&#39;re shria and peaches and where&#39;s momma Dino and her babies and Rudy and the othe dinosaurs and pterosaurs
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaThe last time we saw buck was in the 3rd movie
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaA
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI feel like I need Ritalin just to watch this trailer...
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWonder if somebody planned this whole asteroid event to happen so he could rule the world&#39;s ruins and enslave the survivors? Anyone thinks that also?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI grew up with these movies! :D The best animated ones so happy so see a old characters coming back!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaone of the trailer videos got deleted
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIs this the UK trailer, because it says cinemas instead of theaters.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaScrat siempre liandola ajajaja.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIm not ripping on the movie but man what a terribly made trailer
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaYEAH how can 12  ice age creatures with no technology bea able to stop a moon sized meteor?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI am dead because of this movie&#39;s awesomness
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaBuck! I love that character!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaSeems like it might be decent ridiculous fun.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaAWESOME!!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI just hope Scrat has more scenes cause I felt like he was hardly in the 4th movie and I hope the plot is a bit more bigger and better then the 4th one, I felt like the 4th one&#39;s plot was too simple, so far Ice Age 3 is still the best one. :D
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaMIRA ES RIKURA PAPA
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIt said shira was in this movie.. Where is she?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI knew this movie is going to be the last Ice Age movie.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaSid&#39;s wish is killing us!!!!!! LOL
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaHuh! That was... unexpectedly funny. I didn&#39;t really like the last one, but this one might be better again...
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaThis looks really good!! I love Scrat so much &lt;3 He is hilarious :D
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait 👍.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaYes, they are being buck back in the this movie, haha can&#39;t wait but what about shira? I wonder if she&#39;s going to be in the movie
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI think that Ice age 5 was created only because to make happy Sid. No one can remain lonely.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaBuck is back!!! Oooh yeeaaahhh!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI have to admit, the colours and movements on the characters <i>really</i> made an improvement.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaBuck is back!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome Buck&#39;s back !!!!! Can&#39;t wait 😂😁😀😱
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not bein&#39; funny, and no offense, but this is the single worst trailer I&#39;ve ever seen for any movie ever. Absolute shite from start to finish. How did this happen? Can we fix it?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitais that Neil Tyson&#39;s voice i hear in the beginning ?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaWhy is the static bit played twice?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaBUCK!!!!
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIce age 1 was my childhood and I felt like it was a perfect film with the music, compositionjng and character development. Now it feels like a massive money grab, which is a shame :(
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaIf Louis is not in this film, I&#39;ll be pissed off.
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitalooks like a fun movie
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitawhat song?
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitaawesome
Ohq6NmKMja8delimeterByIshitawhat is it with sequels these days i thought the first film had a great ending. oh well just a $$$ grab to sell more toys i guess
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI bought this movie. Anne Hathaway is wonderful. And what can we say about Meryl Streep. One of the best actresses of her generation.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=0m43s">0:43</a>  it&#39;s not &quot; She Died Or Something?&quot; ??????????????
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThe Devil Wears Prada<br><br>A movie about subtle workplace abuse/ emotional terrorism/ psychological harassment. <br><br>A movie about the disastrous effects of materialism, about prioritizing the body over the soul, competence over character... as well as the possibility of cultivating the courage of character.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s all about &quot;who knows who&quot; at the party in Paris! It&#39;s networking darling, not about the clothes, is it?!??
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita❤️
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita2:16 Pm July 7th 2021
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI’m about to watch this movie for the first time
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI was just thinking how Meryl Streep’s character reminded me alitte of  Emma Thompson’s character in “Cruella” then I see Mark Strong playing the sidekick to them in both movies😂
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaFUN FACT<br>here at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=0m42s">0:42</a> she says &quot;did she go to Rwanda for beans or something&quot;<br>but in the movie she says &quot;has she died or something&quot;
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitajust watched the movie first time, and I am mad about the steak. Yeah I am a dude.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaIf you view Andy as the bad buy and Miranda as the good guy then the film is way beter.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaOne of my most favourite films. Anne Hathaway is stunningly beautiful in this film.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI really enjoy Meryl Streep movies. She’s a really good actress and does good movies. Anne Hathaway on the other hand is a heaven sent beautiful Angel!!!! But aside from her being gorgeous I enjoy watching her movies as well. I have never seen this but I do remember the intern with Robert DeNiro. That was good
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI came here after watching The Intern!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI have the book which I&#39;m going to read on the 7th June 2021 aka tommorow at school but after I finish reading the book I&#39;m going to watch the movie
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how much copyright they paid to put “prada “ in the title of the movie lol
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaheard Cruella has similar vibes. Might check out this one first.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaWhy Emily Blunt accepted this role?
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitareply if your watching this in 2021, bet no one is
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer literally showed the entire plot
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaWho watch it with 666k views?
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaDo what you love . If you want to be fashionable , great . If you don&#39;t , that&#39;s great too. It&#39;s your life , what is important to you , it&#39;s  all that matters .
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaAehy&#39;ve met Devils that didn&#39;t have to pawn their Prada gear however every Devil&#39;s specialty is &quot;The Poor Man&quot;.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaYou shown whole movie.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaDespite the good messages that the film carries, it showed a bad image of Western life that I cannot accept；how can a partner establish a relationship only two days after ending his/her relationship with his/her ex-partner who loved him for so long as if nothing had happened. If this is the nature of a relationship and life they really have it is a miserable tragedy.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita“Did she go to Rwanda for the beans or something 😂😭💀”<br><br><br>This movie will forever be gold.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s basically Jewel from Rio vs. Mrs. Fox from Fantastic Mr. Fox.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI’ve been dreaming for a long time to get the job at fashion magazine. Finally, the dream comes true. I get a new job at Elle Magazine. I love The Devil Wears Prada.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaMaranda very stern .Meryl Streep was fantastic and Anne Hathaway.  Fanastic movie.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> does anyone know that scene? I don’t remember seeing it even in the deleted scenes
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThey should make a sequel &quot;Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns&quot;.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaClothes ― only haute couture, in the pockets-the rustle of bills, the soul-wants adventures, in amorous affairs-only openwork!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThe only film in which there is not a single real man
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThis old hag looks like that witch from 101 Dalmatian 😂😂
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaWomen are more likely to like this movie than men. One of the rare cases when the film adaptation is much more interesting than the book.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaWould I ever work for a pushy, demanding person like Miranda Priestly? Probably not.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaCould any one tell me the names of any more such bossy female movies?<br>Promise I&#39;ll thankyou.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!

6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaIs it weird I like this movie despite it&#39;s super girly
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite movie
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaAfter all these years I guess we need a SEQUEL
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=1m09s">1:09</a> girls

6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThen meet me in hell
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI have to make a review of some movie and my decision was between the butterfly effect or this movie... I cried with the butterfly effect trailer I guess I&#39;ve already found a winnner.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitai rented this movie last night and watched. As far as comedy goes...meh, i didn&#39;t laugh too much (Comedy is subjective) however, i was slightly amused when Miranda demanded the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript. But the acting was superb,  Streep was incredible, she pulled off the glamorous Miranda and made it look easy so was Tucci, and Hathaway...it took me awhile to recognize Emily Blunt and Adrian Grenier (i kept looking at them and saying to myself &quot;i&#39;ve seen her/him somewhere), but they did great. The ending was also very good, and i absolutely loved the part when they went to Paris, they also were in NYC the rest of the movie. If they could&#39;ve squeezed London in there somehow, it would&#39;ve been amazing. Anyway the story was engaging, for me anyway, since i do love fashion and clothes (though my style is considered &quot;not with it&quot; LOL). It gives an inside look into what all goes on on the fashion scene. It also carries a great message, &quot;be true...be you&quot;.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola amei !!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!!!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaFun fact...not sure when this particular trailer came out, but it wasn&#39;t the first one I can promise you that.  The movie studio&#39;s original trailer didn&#39;t use anything from any scene beyond the first few minutes of the movie.  It was originally a &quot;teaser&quot; trailer but it proved so effective, and gave away little of the movie like many trailers tend to do, they kept that as the primary trailer.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaAs a guy who couldn&#39;t care any less about fashion whatsoever (even worse than the Andrea character lol)...this was  BRILLIANT movie and despite it being very fashion-focus, it also was character-driven, which  made it awesome to me.  IMO, the worst part of the movie was Andrea&#39;s relationship with her boyfriend.  Her boyfriend just came off, to me, as EXTREMELY needy and, imo, distracted from the movie.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaMerle Streep as the boss<br>Cat woman as assistant <br>Captain America’s scientist as a fashion designer <br>Mary Poppins as the British assistant
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaEllen
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of my favorite movies. Its fantastic
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThere was a Rwanda reference. Now I know that the dialogue was changed.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaENTJ&#39;s surely loving this movie 😂
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaDid she go to Rwanda for the beans? - in the movie it was ‘Has she died or something?’
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaPeople think success just happens to you. It doesn&#39;t. You want this life, the decision is yours.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThe Rwanda for the beans line didn&#39;t make it to the final cut
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaWow when did that happen? I&#39;ve never watched that scene
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaMicheal Scarn’s favourite movie
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaHallo in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a> in Andy and  Nigel make over  what is this a deleted or expanded scene of the film ?
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaJust finished this book taday.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI miss when movie trailers were narrated in that tone by the same male voice
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaAnne Hathaway ❤️
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaUgly Betty except she’s pretty
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaJust watched it absolutely a beautiful movie. I was never a fan of merl streep but i going to start watching her movies
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaRemember when movie trailers had a narrator <br>The nostalgia
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaGood movie
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita&quot;did she go to Ruanda for beans or something&quot;😁 its hilarious if theybput this instead
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaVINCENT CHASE LOOKS GREAT
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaA lot of lines which were not in the movie.... That&#39;s all!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaMeryl Streep in this comedy was raunchy, drum and dazzling
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaAndy&#39;s friends are awful and toxic
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita“So if the devil wears Prada, Adam eve wearin nada, I’m in between but way more fresher with way less effort, cause when you try hard that’s when you die hard” - Kanye West 🔥🔥🔥🔥
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaSteak! Where’s my steak?!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitamaybe i should watch this film?🤔
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita🐴🐶🐰🐯NOT FOOD
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaThey mention loads of designers and brands in the movie but it&#39;s funny that Prada is not even mentioned once.
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaMens wear VIP, Amul,, Macho, Frienche underwear baniyan
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaSuccess just doesn&#39;t happen to you. The decision is yours!
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOZwUQKu3E&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> Joe Jonas? lol
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaIts funny to think how Emily Blunt is  mentioned nowhere in the trailer or credits and its all about Anne Hathaway. And now 12 to 13 years later Anne has almost faded away but Emily rose to world wide recognition
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshitaGet me armani😭😂😂
6ZOZwUQKu3EdelimeterByIshita1.03 sharp,these are NOT woman hands.....!?

3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaJust finished watching it. Great movie actually.
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaGuys the morale of this story is that if you have a low self esteem issue, just remember they chose you for a reason
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaThis Molly is a hard 10, meanwhile this guy is a 5
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaShe was daamm beautiful

3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitahonesly, i believe this is possible, but guys like these have such low self esteem, theyd probably ruin it.
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaI love when she walks into the airport like its a shampoo commercial.  She&#39;s incredibly beautiful though.
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaIf yall actuallu SEARCH thsi guy up youll see that hes actually kinda hot! They just made him ugly and shy for the movie 😂
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaJessica Jones is that you..? Straight up Savage.

3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaCute movie.  Good acting.  Could have done without the swearing .  why do movie producers feel the need to put in Jesus name in swearing.  They wouldn&#39;t use mohomeds name.
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitaThe girl really isn’t pretty is the only issue
3F0XwZex1jQdelimeterByIshitai find jay Baruchel extremely attractive like to me hes an 8 atleast idk

VjctHUEmutwdelimeterByIshitalol the only reason why this lame ass movie is getting any attention is cause Eminem is promoting it and hes NOT even in the movie.

VjctHUEmutwdelimeterByIshitaEminem is trash, hopefully he doesn&#39;t ruin this movie that looks great. Why did he have to become a pop rapper!?<br><br>I wish they got talented guys like MF DOOM to do stuff. He is a  real rapper, real hip hop, none of this New Eminem Rihanna shit.

VjctHUEmutwdelimeterByIshitaEminem THE GOAT.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI hope its good, but what is the point of CGI magic? its probably crap
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaanna kendrick? Im in
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaGreat actors i think its gonna be a great movie hope so
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaScrew Man of Steel I want to watch... actually I wouldn&#39;t go that far!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman is in this movie. This movie&#39;s already good.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathe prestige robbery version
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman Narrator. Well that is mandatory now.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this

KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaYeah.... Pretty damn cool movie! Finally something that isn&#39;t a period piece,superhero movie(in which I do love), garbage comedy,or a remake. Maybe there&#39;s some hope left in Hollywood
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI feel like Morgan Freeman is going to be the real mastermind behind everything
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaHoly Shit.

Alfred Pennyworth
Shoshanna
Common
Bruce Banner
Mark Zuckerberg
Defendor
That crazy chick from Wedding Crashers
And GOD himself???!!!!!

...And I&#39;m anticipating The Avengers 2...why?
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaOr some techno mumbo jumbo.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaDamn, Morgan Freeman even narrates his own movie..... Must see.........  
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaId like an explanation like The Prestige....
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaright this looks awesome
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaactually that would be great. nothing like seeing the skeptical people getting holes poked in their logic
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaRun boy run!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaNow that looks good!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitafucken aye, this looks awesome
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaagain with Morgan Freeman&#39;s voice. so awesome
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitalol i was thinking the same.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaGod damn this looks awesome.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitawow.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitadafuq!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitayou&#39;re saying that as if you can only watch one movie... ever. Why not both?
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or did Eisenberg seem like he just reprise his role as Mark Zuckerberg in this movie; someone that exudes self-confidence that is borderline arrogance? Not that I&#39;m complaining.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaor it&#39;s just normal sleight of hand and tricks..
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaWoah woah woah... let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, Lucius Fox, Alfred, The Hulk, Tallahassee and Columbus??

This movie is insane!!
Def gunna see it
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaOr alien technology..
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaIlluminiti
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaWoodkid! :D
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s The Prestige + CGI?..
why not.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaAlfred high as fuck owning a bank and shit
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaScrew Iron Man 3, I wanna watch this!!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so confused... 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t even think about having a sequel of The Prestige without Chris Nolan&#39;s collaboration in it. BTW. i think it&#39;s not a sequel and also no magic movies can touch the levels of The Prestige, coz Prestige is not a magic movie, it&#39;s a mindbombing movie.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshita1:42 illuminati in the blue lighting 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaIf this isnt real magic then ..Lemme guess ... Ruffalo was the part of the team all along.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not going to say it was aliens.... but it was aliens.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaCant wait
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaALIENS.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI will be really disappointed if their explanation for how they do what they do is real magic. 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t decide if this is a realistic movie about some crazy good magicians..or if they&#39;re flipping it to make them ACTUALLY having magic abilities. Also can&#39;t decide if the latter would ruin the movie or make it more epic. 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitarun boy run- woodkid
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitanice
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaWanna see so bad :D
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMay seem to be a good month. Lots of movies coming out that month
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathis actually looks pretty cool

KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaSmall world, haha.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaokay I guess
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitayeah but thats not saying much

KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitalooks good, morgan freeman narration...now I have to watch six more times then Im suppose too, thanks god
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaSong from the 42 trailer.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathe two dislikes were from people that thought it was a download button :)
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to see it awesome shit
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaNothing is ever impossible. Everything has it&#39;s way...
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathe cast is amazing
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaHollywood is pulling a magic trick of there own... An original movie?????????
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI enjoyed burt wonderstone, it was an entertaining movie if you could let it out of your mind that it wasnt going to be an Oscar winning movie, I had quite a few laughs.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaso thats what happened to batmans money

KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaBenn wating on this shit
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathis looks cooooooooooooooool !
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaThis really does look like one of the stupidest films ever. Just how preposterous does it look? I know cinema is an illusion, a trick played on the brain, but this looks like unlikely events punctuated by impossible events.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshita2:25 of brainwashed.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaFranco douche?
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaDEFINITELY looking forward to this one.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! Visually stunning! It&#39;s like an illusion movie the way it looks,hope it has a good story though..
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaEpic
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman is such a boss
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaAre......You .....Watching ............Closely?
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshita:D awesome!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaDid you realize that this film&#39;s main promotional phrase is an answer to The Prestige&#39;s Borden&#39;s &quot;Are you watching closely?&quot;
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaGood and interesting clips. What&#39;s with all the crappy movie names lately? &quot;now you see me?&quot;
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m wondering if they&#39;re technomancers or just that amazing with magic.  
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaWoodkid&#39;s music!!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitanot going to lie, this gave me goosebumps
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaNow this looks like a movie I would go to theaters for!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaFantastic Cast!! Theyre all just in the wrong movie together, and they used the same music as the 42 trailer did!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaAw yeah
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaalfreddddddd :D 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitawoodkid &lt;3
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitalooks like an interesting movie ...horrible trailer though
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitalooks good I like the trailer music and I find morgan freeman adds +10 to awesomeness as well
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman FTW!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaAmazing

KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathis movie is almost like jumper with the bank robbing
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitathe fact that i know little of the plot makes this trailer great on its own. 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitagood music as well
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitawill for sure see this amazing cast!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good. 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaWell at least we know it has to be better than Burt Wonderstone.
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman and Watson!!
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaHmm.. more magic movies
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks good 
KzJNYYkkhzcdelimeterByIshitaKool Aid :D
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaOMG, FINALLY!  A movie for the rest of us!  This looks like Oscar material for sure.  Cannot wait to see this - Epic!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaSHWAZZZ? ! awesome

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaOmar Little sighting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=1m57s">1:57</a>
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThanks Jesus. I know I don&#39;t believe in you and all, but now I get why people do. You really do work in mysterious ways. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaGonna be a classic.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer. Showcases the comedy and zany qualities. The actual tone is really melancholic, and sad. Gonna be incredible.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like PTA is having a bit of fun after two very heavy films.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitathis film has Oscar written all over it
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT!!! PTA is my fav director.. Birdman and then this.. what an end to the year!!<br>Curious why in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=1m85s">1:85</a> aspect ratio. PTA was always a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=2m35s">2:35</a> man...
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitayes! this looks hilarious. i burst out laughing about 3 times!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI hear there will be a Pynchon cameo in the film! Only problem is no one knows what he looks like anymore. haha
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaPynchon through the lens of PTA…its the artistic meeting of two men who are masters of their craft. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaJOANNA
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like The Big Lebowski starring Neil Diamond.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThis has to be the best movie ever made or else I&#39;ll kill myself
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaHELL YESSS!!! There&#39;s even a Growlers cameo during that last supper! Can&#39;t fuckin&#39; wait!!!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaDAT GRAIN. FACK YEA.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaoh fuck yea.. great cast... this looks cra-cra... gotta lov it when the crazy mo fo in the room is your lawyer... wish i had one.. lol
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThat looks FANTASTIC. God bless Paul Thomas Anderson.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaPTA is hands down the most underrated director working today. Hoping he can nab some kind of oscar for this film. Anxiously waiting to see what happens.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThis is my Guardians of the Galaxy right here.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaFuck. Yes. That is all. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s even more beautiful than I ever imagined
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me somewhat of Serpico, the film with Al Pacino.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitastarring zac galafanakis and hugh jackmans&#39; gay baby
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaGod damn, I can&#39;t wait to watch this and wash The Master off of me.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThis! This! A million times this!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThe growlers are in the movie?!?!?!?! YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like Miami Vice + Boogie Nights + American Hustle + Wolf of Wall Street + Cheech and Chong.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS GOING TO BE BIG OMG I CANT IM SO EXCITED AND OMG SASHA 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaDecember has never felt so far.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThe Growlers @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a>
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaOHHHH YEAHHH!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie that looks like it worth watching. something that not super original,or special effect&#39;s drowned,or super hero involved............ :D
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaCame here for The Growlers 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThis is like the movie version of the Kings of Leon&#39;s album Mechanical Bull
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitawhats with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a>? dafuqing last supper

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitafuck yeah the growlers!!!! 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitait looks fat, robust, fabulous, smeared all over with that rich stench that is Joaquin Pheonix with just a souciant of PTA&#39;s leftovers from The Master. I want to eat this film. Its like the mindful version of American Hustle, without the compulsory Amy Adamic casting decision. I&#39;ll be waiting in a dark theatre till Christmas. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThe Growlers cameo at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a> !!!

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI think at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZfs22E7JmI&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> mark that&#39;s pornstar Belladonna :))
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cross between The Big Lebowski &amp; Jackie Brown which pretty much = win.

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaJoaquin Phoenix with mutton chops can pull off a decent looking Wolverine. This movie looks fun. Josh Brolin speaking Chinese was hilarious.

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitai want to make love to the neon text in this trailer.  Fuck yeah PTA. you are a legend.

wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m very curious. It looks funny for sure, almost Lebowski like in the absurdity. So let&#39;s see where it goes from there.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaHoly Mama
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaAmazing.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaFUCK MY BODY IS READY. ARGHHHHH
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t get into the book but I&#39;ve been waiting on the film because of PTA and the cast. The shoulder check at :26 is genius! The most hilarious shot in a trailer since DiCaprio flung his champagne glass into the bushes in the Wolf of Wall Street trailer!<br><br>And Martin Short? More genius.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaYES!!!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaMy testicles have exploded
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaKind of gives me an American Hustle vibe, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s just because of the period setting.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YES
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI almost never watch trailers twice in a row.  This is an exception. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FUCK <br><br>HOLY FUCK<br><br>HOLYFUCK
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitawhoa this looks bad
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitazD
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitai dont usually laugh at comedy scene from movie trailers. this had me dying with laughter, 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the same kind of tone as Boogie Nights which I am definitely down for
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaLooks wacky but in a good way. 
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaAlright, December 12, time to get here now! My second most anticipated film of the year; it looks fuckin&#39; amazing! PTA, you never disappoint us.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaohhhh oscar season, i fucking love you.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitahahaha awesome. had no idea this was gonna be a comedy. can&#39;t wait!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so stoked right now. Looks like another masterpiece from PTA.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI can hear Barry Sonnenfeld yawning from my house.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T EVEN HANDLE THIS<br>WHY AM I ON THE FLOOR??!!
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to try to contain my excitement, but i think this trailer is now my favorite movie ever.
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaThank you based god
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitadat vintage look
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitaI need this film in my life sooooo fucking badly x
wZfs22E7JmIdelimeterByIshitameh

J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita&quot;I Love You 3000&quot;
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaMCU ate Watson and Holmes both BBC and Movie. erp
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe Iron Man &amp; Dr. Strange didn&#39;t have a Sherlock reference moment in Infinity War.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaarsen lopin
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaMovie could have ended earlier if he showed up with his iron man suit
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaUhh... 128 Benedict&#39;s dislike this video.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWho else only likes Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>edit: just staying that this is not a hate comment so please don&#39;t hate on me. It&#39;s just my opinion :)
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThe cinematography in Guy Ritchie&#39;s original Sherlock Holmes is much more better than the cinematography for his live-action Aladdin.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaone of the most beautiful Watson  I ever seen before
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaIt’s The Iron Man and Yon Rogg
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita😍 love Sherlock
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m doing a test on this like right now..and I kinda went to the bathroom for this..☕🍻🍷💉🔦📆
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaMy love 😍

J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitawho&#39;s here after Holmes &amp; Watson trailer???
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaLa ví en cine y fue muy chulo
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhere your suit tony???
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaIts ironman 😎😎😎😀😀😀😀
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaTony Star(Robert Downey) and Captain Mar-Vell(Jude Law)
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWho came here after &quot;Holmes and Watson&quot; ? 😂😂
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI did not enjoy. It lacked the atmosphere of London. The simple deduction of Holmes and was far to complex.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s why iron man is very smart
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitawAIT WHAT THE HELL HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA I&#39;VE BEEN WATCHING THIS THE WHOLE TIME AND THOUGHT THAT HOLMES JACK HUGHMAN
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThough actors like Keanu Reeves couldn&#39;t develop a British accent, the great RDJ didn&#39;t do so terribly.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaIS this a good movie to watch?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaNot seen this movie, it is good?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaHolmes and Watson brought me here
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSo why did Rachel Mcadams not have an accent???
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSoooo wait a minute...RDJ is Sherlock but also Iron man in the MCU, Benedict is also Sherlock but Dr Strange in the MCU, Jude Law is Dr Watson but also in Captain Marvel in the MCU, Martin Freeman is also Dr Watson but also in the MCU, and Rachel McAdams is in this as and then in Dr Strange too.....Am I making this up or going crazy?!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaRegina George meets Iron Man
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita92 Benedicts dislike this video
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita-Get that out of my face<br>-It&#39;s not in your face it&#39;s in my hand<br>-Okay what&#39;s in your hand out of my face😂
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI love this ! the best !

J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThis is definitely on my list of movies of which I NEED another movie!! Seriously, when will they make a third movie already, it&#39;s been ages!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist, Sherlock Holmes is Tony Stark’s grandfather
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaTONY STARK AS SHERLOCK HOLMES
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI didn’t know iron man and dr stange girlfriend were flirting
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWait......Benedict Cumberbatch is in the MCU, Robert Downey Jr is in the MCU and soon in the Captain Marvel movie Jude Law will be in the MCU!!!!! Thats just straight up crazy!!!! Its like every major actor wants to be in a Marvel Movie!!!! THE COMIC BOOK FILMS ARE TAKING OVER!!!! TAKE THAT JAMES CAMERON HA!!!!!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaA man who were in derkness and suffering with smoking and drugs but now he is a superstar because of his hard work
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaBennedict cumberbatch!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSo.. Now Dr. Strange n Iron Man as a rival?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaDamn Jude Law with a moustache tho
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaPerfektny film
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhat a movie .. briliant
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaEven if it’s old the trailer makes me want to watch it <br>So do you recommend it for me?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t seen this and it&#39;s been nearly ten years.  <br><br>Anyone else on the same boat? <br><br>I plan on seeing it after reading a few of the short stories, just to get an idea of the way Holmes and Watson are portrayed and then see if that&#39;s reflected/reinterpreted well in the film by Robert Downey and Jude Law. So far, though not having read the books, I think the film looks pretty good and they seem quite an interesting pairing with natural chemistry.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSherlock Holmes, action hero... Doesn&#39;t quite follow logic. Maybe we should have... Jean Claude... Van Damme... IS... Poirot! He&#39;s putting the bad guys... into little gray cells!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSo incredible
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitasherlock gnomes
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s the girl who plays Regina George
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaOkay to here is Robert Downey Jr a.k.a Iron man as Sherlock Holmes acting alongside Rachel McAdams. And now Benedict Cumberbatch a.k.a Sherlock Holmes also plays Dr. Strange who also acted alongside Rachel McAdams...
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhat’s the Problem?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhy!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7nJksXDBWc&amp;t=0m31s">0:31</a> TF2 achievement!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitabest of best
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita&quot;Get that out of my face.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s not in your face, it&#39;s in my hand.&quot;<br>&quot;Get what&#39;s in your hand out of my face.&quot;<br>The best bit of the whole movie, so glad it was put in the trailer.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it so weird for me to see Robert play Sherlock after being crazy over the BBC version with Benedict...My mind just can&#39;t believe that this character IS Sherlock... though the movie and his acting are both great here. His voice just sounds so unlike the Iron Man I recognized him to be lol.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitabir muselman Kimi  demeliyem ki yaxsi alinib
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaBenedict &gt; Robert!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitahoi
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaso many action
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaOne of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES EVER. LOVE THIS MOVIE!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitathis is the best performance i&#39;ve ever seen for Jude Law
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitauhh there is a diferrence between sherlock holmes and tony stark <br>and i dont see that in robert downey
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaGuy Ritchie should have directed the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThe best!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaEsto es una mierda
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaselam fbo
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s well and all, but there&#39;s something about the accent... something off...
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaamazing i fucking love this movie!!!!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhere is the deductive reasoning ?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaSuch an epic trailer
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaRobert Downey should at least try to do an english accent.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitacumberbacth is the best sherlock
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitai can be so like him
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how Sherlock would do in the Wild West (which was still going on during and after this time), there should be a movie about that (of course with more Robert, helluva good actor)
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitai just can&#39;t stop watching this movie again and again
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitathis version of Sherlock.Holmes is Van Damme fighting style movie
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI must admit this was a PROPER movie especially if you are a fan of victorian era england. The setting, atmosphere was so wonderfully created. I recommend you guys play ac syndicate.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaamazing movie , Robert Downey Jr was great as Sherlock and Jude Law as Watson!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s no much violence in Sherlock Holmes short stories &amp; novels
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaRoberto Downey Jr. amo a este hombre, es sexy y muy talentoso!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI REALLY need to see this movie.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThis is the only sherlock holmes movie that counts for me
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie rocks
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI wish all trailers were made as catchy and epic as this one. It really was brilliantly edited, etc. And the movie rocked, which also helps.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaIs Jack the Ripper in the movie?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7nJksXDBWc&amp;t=01m02s">01:02</a> who is that actor?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7nJksXDBWc&amp;t=0m51s">0:51</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7nJksXDBWc&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> remind me of masonic temples. Not saying they are, but have a similar set up... movie looks enticing bur eerie at the same time!! Haven&#39;t seen this one yet... nor part II.
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaThis was still in the early days of The Downey-sance
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaI love the trailer! I can not wait until the download &lt;3
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaIs this the first Sherlock Holmes movie though?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitalove that last punch!!
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song?
J7nJksXDBWcdelimeterByIshitajude law with a mustache tho...mmmm

p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE HELL THIS MOVIE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FAST AND FURIOUS FRANCHISE?? AND WHY THE MAKERS OF THE MOVIE CHOOSE A GUY WITH SUCH A RETARDED FACE, IT SHOULD BE PAUL WALKER INSTEAD OF THIS RETARDED GUY
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaFF 8 SEAN BOSWELL PLEASE :)) 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this movie in theaters the summer of 2006 with my friends and this really hot girl that I liked. Oh memories of being younger. 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI MISS THIS. :(
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaHan was my favourite character
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaRest in peice paul walker
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s the best because it&#39;s got good music and the cars are awesome also it&#39;s mainly based on cars to that&#39;s the main best thing
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaBest Fast and Furious movie made. The others are so overrated because of their cast...
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaEh just came back from fast and furious 7 totally disappointing, my hopes to see lucas were pointless. Its not a cars and illegal street racing movie anymore :( its all about how though we are how rich we are how we blow stuff up, kinda reminded me expendables, generic action movie with few rare cars on screen. Ill miss good old fast and furious like it was with tokyo drift.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaComo se llama.la.canción de el comienzo <br>What is name of the song?
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was the best ! of the series. !!!!!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaAnyone tried the blow job bars in tokyo ? I bet Jason statham did 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaŞarkının adı ne
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitadrifting is all about skills.<br>not like those linear drag race that i always see.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaNo offense to Lucas, but his accent nearly ruined this entire movie for me. Not only did it not fit into the theme of the movie, his dad didn&#39;t have the accent, none of the people in the school had the accent, no one but him.  Thats not how it works.  Luckily the overall movie was enjoyable and he isnt a horrible actor.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWich song is in start? Tnx<br>
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song? So in the beginning
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita Was i the only person who really felt like &quot;DK&quot; wasn&#39;t a bad guy?<br> can you blame someone who wants to defend what is theirs?<br>A dude from somewhere else comes into your &quot;turf&quot;<br>tries to defy you <br>steals your girlfriend and makes your friend betray you <br>plus causing the death of that best friend <br>you can&#39;t blame the dude <br>sean was just very cocky imo <br>and to this day DK is still the best drifter in the F&amp;F series
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaOne fast and furious movie that was actually about the cars. And people say its the worst one. If it wasn&#39;t for tokyo drift and the first fast &amp; furious, then I probably would live a normal life, driving normal cars like eveybody else.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaJhonky
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite movie. I really like the first 3 fast and furious movies, coz they are all about tuning cars. But this is best. ;)
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitashouldnt the ending of this movie be the beginning of the 7th one
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis was the only Fast &amp; Furious movie that focused exclusively about street racing...Tokyo Drift was one of it&#39;s kind,no other F&amp;F movie in the WHOLE franchise was like Tokyo Drift (it almost feels like a &quot;Spin-Off&quot;).....I remember that I was watching Tokyo Drift one day,and then after I finished it, I watched Fast &amp; Furious 6,and I felt like: &quot;WOW!!,it&#39;s almost impossible to believe that this two movies are part of the same series&quot;...Tokyo Drift is basically just about racing,I wouldn&#39;t consider it an &quot;Action Film&quot;,but in the other hand,Fast &amp; Furious 6 feels more like a &quot;James Bond&quot; or &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; type of film...I personally love BOTH,but Tokyo Drift gives me more nostalgia feelings,well,maybe because I saw it when I was much younger......Tokyo Drift was a good movie,but I think that Furious 7 will be MUCH better,and besides,in Furious 7 we&#39;ll finally get to see the race between Sean and Dominic.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI hope 7 come back to this level
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaVin Diesel broken the series with his crap american muscle car who have a naturaly V8 aspired .. you can&#39;t compare a turbo boost car with a naturaly aspired .. and muscle car is to havey to do drift , drag race and many skills si  i think 1,2,3 was the best part ! i want to see at the ending tokyo drift Vin Diesel with Lucas Black , Nissan Sivlia VS Plymouth &quot;Road Runner&quot; well Fuck You Vin Diesel u can&#39;t drift with your big fat american car !!!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita<br>
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita&quot;I have money, it&#39;s trust and character I need around me. You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are. One car in exchange for knowing what a man&#39;s made of? That&#39;s a price I can live with.&quot; Best phrase ever!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWhen this movie came out it was so heavily criticized on its story, the different actors, and how it was so different from the original. Now it&#39;s a favourite to most of ya&#39;ll? 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaFavorite one!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the last song?<br><br>
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaSo many deleted scenes shown in trailer but not in the movie... 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaInitial D is way better

p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so underrated. Does anyone know if Lucas Black will be in the next one? I just saw the trailer, and I didn&#39;t see him. I hope he is though. It would make sense for him to be since Han was his friend too.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie rel  bad

p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI prefer this over all over F&amp;F movies.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThi is the best. &lt;3
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was the dumbest movie ever.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThey should have Sean as the new Paul Walker.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaNERD - ROCKSTAR
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaЭто лучший из всех фильмов про форсаж))
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaNot a good trailer, but definitely a good movie.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitapeople were madly playing and listening to this fucking son everywhere . I hated this song too much :@ shit :@ thanks God all left behind !!!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaIs this a throwback or somethin? 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HQ2JLlc4E&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> scene from FF6
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI love Fast 1, Tokyo drift the most, all the new installments are like war action.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaDamn i remember watching Fast and the Furious 1 ... it would inspire me to play with little toy cars lmao.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaplz tell me that bringing this trailer back is a way of saying Lucas Black will come back too, and we can FINALLY see his and Dom&#39;s race???
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis is just awesome great job vin and family
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaRip movie trailer voice guy.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis one have the best soundtrack in the series but I hate how the main character is almost 18 in the movie but he looks like 25+ and he move to Japan and most of the people speak English. 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39; Life is simple, you make choices and you don&#39;t look back &#39;&#39;. That was a great scene and a fantastic line from Han. Such a shame that he had to die in this movie. He was the best character, with a different and a special personality in the Fast And The Furious series, in my opinion.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis one was the last FF movie that was actually about tuned cars and hot girls...

p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitafave FnF from the series. loved Keiichi Tsuchiya (Real Drift King) and Shuichi Shigeno&#39;s (Initial D creator) cameo. focused on tuned cars and street racing. also, one of the most realistic FnF film (the first one has to be the most realistic though).
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThey should bring back the skyline from 2 fast 2 furious lol. One of the best cars that appeared on set!
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita8 years later, what ever happened to that hot piece a ass? 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI miss this kind of fast furious
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaMusics : Tokyo Drift and Rockstar by NERD
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaBest FnF movie, its focused  on cars and racing not that action Bullshit I mean the newer Fast movies are still good but not what the first movie started with.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitawho sings the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HQ2JLlc4E&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a>?
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaHAN FOR THE WIN!!

p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThey are going to be in the movie guys
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitawhat is name a last song ? 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI was rewatching all the Fast and Furious movies, and watched Tokyo Drift a couple times. At <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HQ2JLlc4E&amp;t=1m49s">1:49</a> you see Sean holding and aiming a gun but he never holds/points a gun in the movie. Interesting the things they take out of it.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaBest fast and the furious movie
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this?
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever, please add tokyo into the new f&amp;f
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so hype for Fast 7 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis was my fav movie of them all other than the first one
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaTokyo Drift = the best because Japan and drifting &lt;3
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThis one was so awesome, pure JDM and street racing. Loved it.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaWhen I was a kid I remember going to the cinema to see this movie when it came out, and in theaters seat there are drink holders, so I put my coca cola bottle in it and pretended it was a shifter while watching this movie. After that, we went home and rented 2 fast 2 furious movie. Damn, memories.
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8HQ2JLlc4E&amp;t=0m31s">0:31</a> han :(
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie of fast and furious series without a doubt. 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitain terms of cars and location its still my favorite of the series !
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaOld but Gold :D 
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitai feel like this is the only F&amp;F that is TOTALLY focused on tuned cars and street racing, and i still think that this is the best one of the series<br>ps: i love paul too
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitahello my friends<br>xD
p8HQ2JLlc4EdelimeterByIshitaah D: memories :D

akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only going to see this movie because of Dan Stevens yet they didn&#39;t show him in the trailer/:
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaOh Alison you poor beautiful, talented little thing. You are too good for this trash. This film is insulting on so many levels. To think that you were in Kings of Summer only a little over two years ago and now this. Well, I guess we all have pay the rent. Still pretty sad though, oh well.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akwGjUeU6YA&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a> please?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that they play after Worth it?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita<b>I&#39;M SO WATCHING</b> THIS!  hahahahahahahahaha!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitait looks adorable and very funny 😄
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaDAKOTA JOHNSON OMG!!!!!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaDull, obvious, stereotypical and predictable chick flick comedy.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitathey absolutely butchered the book
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akwGjUeU6YA&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a>??
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitalol &quot;No penis shall pass&quot;  OMG! That....  I fkn love Rebel Wilson!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHi there,  I&#39;m Proud Of You! cooperative quilt What&#39;s your opinion about !!!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaRebel wilson
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaSoooo......Christian grey didn&#39;t workout.....
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaLast part reminds me of the deadpool trailer.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI work with someone that has the face of the brunette and the body of the blond.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitathis is what happens when you make to much remakes and stupid movies like this
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHow to be single? Just be Rebel Wilson.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at 1.23 ? :)
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI saw on wikipedia that Nick Bateman is in this movie??
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThe sequel should be, &quot;How to be single: Step two, Feminism&quot;....lol
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita&quot;How to be single&quot;<br>A movie about  NOT being single every night a new.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaLife after the Bellas by Fat Amy
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWheres the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s Trailer?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaplease  don&#39;t  tid punch  me
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitathis is going  to  be  a  good  funny  movie  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitacomo preparal bandejas de fruta
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m single and happy. No need to fuck up, see maself drunk woke up on strange bed with the guy and ask where am I(lol)!!! Just saying&#39;But I love to see t&#39;is movie.....
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitacan anyone tell me the name of the song when Dakota approaches those men for drinks?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNeeds More Alison Brie
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaEver heard someone say &quot;emoji&quot;? Me neither. That&#39;s how detached from reality producers are. Thanks, overpaid execs unable to tell a good movie from your ass, for approving this garbage based on poorly conceived market demographics that state that a portion of the young adult market that loves to get drunk and sleep around wants movies they can relate to. Hint: they don&#39;t.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHaving been on a lot of dates, comedies have just not been good. This and Central Intelligence finally seem date worthy. Now who wants to be my date?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaCASEY!! &lt;3
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWORTH IT YASSSSS
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI feel like the trailer probably spoiled the best jokes. I&#39;m still watching the movie, because Rebel Wilson.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaSo excited!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHAHA! Oh man it&#39;s comedy about an uptight female being shown by a strong sassy female how to really live life! She has a hairy downstairs too! Hilarious!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaAnastasia could have used Rebel Wilson. Rebel would be like &quot;HIT IT AND QUIT IT ANA&quot;.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita&#39; Listen girls ,if  you want to be happy single then be a slut and get drunk a lot . Because this what men like in women .And if they don&#39;t  like it  , they can go to hell .&#39;                                                                          Actually we ( men ) will just chose the women  who are not drunk sluts <br>. It&#39;s  simple  as that .
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI love how these movies make it seem that single peoples hobbies are only drinking, partying and casual sex. I also wish that they would stop presenting the idea that women can pay for everything with natures credit card and not there own hard earned cash.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThe American Film industry has hit a new low...     This is literally the downfall of society.   This is utter garbage.    What happened to HIGH QUALITY FILMMAKING?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitait will be epic
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaomg yes dakota johnson and alison brie cant wait !
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitadskota gets prettier every time i see her 😍
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita&quot;no penis shall pass!!!&quot; lmao
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie comes out on my birthday!!!!! Must see as a present
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWhen this ad came on, i thought it was for fifty shades of grey 2...whoops
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaCame here for Alison Brie. The rest of this movie looks like garbage.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita&quot;No penis shall pass!&quot; XD
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaBut why did she break up with Christian?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;I&#39;m an independent woman and I don&#39;t need a man&quot; women will flock to this. Lol, jk. It looks pretty cute.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitapretty good
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaGandalf tho xD
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaim excited for this!!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWORTH IT BY FIFTH HARMONY YAY
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akwGjUeU6YA&amp;t=0m24s">0:24</a> I&#39;m fucking screaming!! Don&#39;t know why I find that part so funny
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaAm I&#39;m the only female disgusted by this movie? I mean Jesus Christ, I&#39;m getting tired of casual sex and alcohol being pushed in your face like its progressive.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaYeah, this trailer had me since Rebel Wilson. Ha!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitait feels like gandalph is staring at me<br>no penis shall pass!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNo paynis shall pass!!!!!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWatched the whole ad before a video bc rebel wilson! YESSS
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaIs this the sequel of fifty shades of gray .. after the break up?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t have to make a movie about it, could&#39;ve followed me around for 18 years
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHa Gandalf and pussy in the same reference. Well played.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWB stall movies before batman v superman
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWTF? is this supposed to be funny ? rebel Wilson called out the kardashian for being famous talentless people, but I think that she shouldn&#39;t have casted the first stone.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNO PENIS SHALL PASS
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita&quot;No penis shall pass &quot; lmao😂😂
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNot sure if I&#39;m Dakota or Leslie, but I do know tit punches suck!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThere are no strong, independent men on the poster for this film! I demand that they put positive representations of men in this film!!!!<br>You see how idiotic that sounds? So why is it when feminists say the exact same thing about women in films or video games geared towards men, they are applauded, but when we reverse the genders it sounds retarded? Maybe the answer is both are ridiculous!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWARNER BROS. Stop greenlighting these movies. Holy shit, how the fuck are you guys not bankrupt?
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaPEACHES. THEY HAVE HER SONG IN IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this movie!!! Arggh!!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaAfter experiencing  Fifty Shades of Grey , there is definitely a need to stay single . Seems logical :P
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitathat moment when hollywood makes a movie about your life
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaWhere the f*ck are feminists when you need&#39;em.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking damn awful....Jesus Christ.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshita<b>Leslie Mann hasn&#39;t aged A SINGLE DAY since George of the Jungle in 1997... how&#39;s that even possible?</b>
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaLooks shit but alison brie doe
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaHa silly Warner Brothers; I don&#39;t need to watch a movie on how to stay single to stay single. I have my looks and personality for that!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s nice to see Ders getting work
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNO PENIS SHALL PASS! Literally, I&#39;m gay...
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI loved it
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaMy plan is to literally review everything in the world ever! Enjoy!
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitabecause I&#39;m batman.......
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaNo. Thank. You.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaDamon Wayans better lock her down after that smile exchange.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is fucking disgusting .
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI really think Dakota Johnson is a really beautiful girl. I&#39;d hook up with her.
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitai love this
akwGjUeU6YAdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even need a guide to how to be single

y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWatching this before I re read the book!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?&quot;
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaTEN YEARS. ARGH. I FEEL SO OLD.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaIf you don&#39;t want to read watch the trailer it will make you read it

y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE HARRY POTTER SO MUCH!!!!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitathe trailers kinda confuse me, they aren&#39;t really like the movie if you know what i mean
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaAgree or Disagree? <br><br>They should make a movie or serious of the upbringing of the Original Order with Sirius and his squad, the rise of Lord V, the different dark creatures, etc. <br><br>I miss my childhood.... Movie premiers with all the fans in harry potter gear, waiting in line to see the midnight showing 2 days in advanced... non stop talk in class, harry potter week during the last week of october, joining the quidditch team after school. I had a substitute once during harry potter week dress TO THE T like dumbledor. it was incredible.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaVery good trailer, then now

y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWatching the movie at the moment. I love the last twenty minutes of the film the most. Such a good film 👍
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaThis video is fantastic!!!😄👍
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI just realized that Hillary Clinton was in this film 😂😂😂 <br><br><br><br><br>jk
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitai wish there was a scene umbridge dies and she burns TO HELL
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaim currently reading OOTP, but earlier I just watched some parts of A Very Potter Musical, I CAME BACK TO THE TRAILER TO CLEAR MY MIND BECAUSE THAT STUPID MUSICAL, CHANGED EVERYTHING. JSJXJWDJJDJDJD I COULDN&#39;T CONCENTRATE! I WAS READING THE PART AT THE GRAND HALL DURING BREAKFAST AND THEM FINDING OUT THAT BELLATRIX ESCAPED AZKABAN AND I&#39;M JUST, SHOOK. WHY? WHY? IT CHANGED THE ENTIRE WAY I VIEWED ALL OF THIS AND IT&#39;S SOO ANNOYING. Well, I&#39;m never going back to that again 😂 It was good, but it just... changed, everything XD
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitawhy not practice defense against the dark arts in the Chamber of Secrets

y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaCedric love you very much......<br>Robert u r tooo handsome......
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWHEN THE BITCH OF AN DOLORES UMBRIDGE SEPERATED THE KISSING COUPLE I ALMOST DIED FROM NOROMANCIAFLUEIDA
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a>. Your welcome
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s Draco tho?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita. Is on book three and watched the trailer anyways. Oh my god.. I hate it. I love it. I hate that I love it. Oh my gosh what a I feeling.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaOMG I FORGOT HOW MUCH I HATED UMBRIDGE 😂😂😂
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI was born in 2006 my childhood was watching Harry Potter
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or Harry Potter trailers are just as epic as the movies?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaThis is something I&#39;ve been thinking about for ages. I&#39;d love to see a film all about Tom M. Riddle. It could start with a prologue of Merope forcing Tom Riddle to fall in love with her and then the prologue ends with her giving birth to their son. It might actually have to be in two parts if the writers really go into depth. And it could end right before The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone begins with Voldemort killing James and Lily and attempting to kill Harry. Any thoughts?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer song sounded alike from The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m57s">1:57</a>.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaHarry gettin&#39; dem ladies 🌝
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI love this book, and this film. And sooo many years later, I remember this trailer perfectly.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie in the series.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI think JKR should make a film dedicated to the Black sisters and their lives.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaGod the Harry Potter theme song is soooooooooooo god!!!!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaBook was so much better, this is still good tho
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitahp
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita<b>has seen the film 10 billion times</b><br><br><b>still watches the trailer</b><br><br><br>IT STILL GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS I CANT
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI think Harry potter said the d words gosh
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaout of all of the HP movies I was really disappointed with the order of the phoenix. there was so much from the book cut out, the acting was meh, and the special effects, like grawp, were comical. i was most disappointed with the scenes with harry and dumbledore, it did have been so much more. in the book harry is supposed to scream at dumbledore. and i was also disappointed with snape and harry scenes, especially the memories.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitai love tge part of the trailer from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a>
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitai love harry potter and the order of the phoenix, its my favourite
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaCan you guys please help me understand this from the books? I love them, so don’t hate me. <br><br>In OOTP Ron and Hermione are chosen as prefects, and we learn that prefects are chosen amongst the 5th  years. We already know 7th years (and maybe 6th?) can be elected Head Boy or Girl. But Ron and Hermione are still prefects in their 6th year, so it’s more than just one year of being prefect, which means that people in that years 5th year have no chance to become anything. How the fuck is that fair? If prefects are chosen for 2 or 3 years in the 5th grade of any year, that means 5th years for the next 1 or 2 years cannot be chosen as prefects because the position’s taken. You could be the best student Hogwarts has ever seen and it’s like, “Sorry, dude, your 5th year won’t produce prefects.” That makes no sense to me
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaCedric Diggory. We miss Cedric Diggory.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitai regret not being a potterhead when these films released on the big screens. I am now. I wish in 2030 this will be studied in every school. Literature  or film making specifically
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> that spoiler tho
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely my favorite Harry Potter film
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI really like Harry Potter!!!!<br>Best Movie Ever!!!!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaUmbridge: the character I love to hate. Love the movie tho.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaOh Alan Oh Alan Rickman...
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitasłabne
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaThe music in this trailer is very Doctor Who..
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI will always recommend that people should read the book. I strongly believe in the generations to come harry potter would be used for literature.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaHey guys check out the honest trailer of harry potter it will like totally be hilarious and it will shock and surprise you!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI must not tell lies!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaRip Alan rickman :(
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI literally know every line and every sound in this trailer by heart. When it came out I watched it a few times a day until I saw the film.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaRIP Alan Rickman :(
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitajust count how many way of thinking? possible by analogy
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think the trailer does the film/book justice :/
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita&quot;You will lose everything.&quot; <br>I never got why Voldemort didn&#39;t just have everyone else killed. Ron, Hermonie, all the Weasleys etc. Then Harry would have had nothing to fight for. But hey, wouldn&#39;t have made such a thrilling story I guess!!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ZW7KXaXYk&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a> Harry is walking as a emotionless zombie in this movie😂😂
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWorst of the series by far.
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI just realised how good this trailer was for this film!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaOrder of the Phoenix, the biggest disappointment of my life<br>WHY DAVID YATES? WHY YOU FUCKING BITCH!? THAT DUMBLEDORE&#39;S FIGHT AGAINST TOM SHOULD&#39;VE BEEN WAAAAY BETTER THAN THAT SILLY BITCH FIGHT!<br>Dumbledore on the floor? Struggling hard against TOM RIDDLE??? Come on, didn&#39;t you read the books?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitapossibly the best trailer of the series
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI will forever regret not being into Harry Potter when I was younger. It would be fantastic watching this on the big screen. I remember when the films where coming out and every kid my age was excited but I wasn&#39;t interested. Now at 21 I love Harry Potter and I&#39;ll make sure my kids will grow up the right way
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaguys learn turkish and watch it that way its cooler like that
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell does the &quot;Defence againts the dark arts&quot; teacher change every year?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s tonks?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaHarry kissing??
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI have all the Harry Potter films they all generally fantastic, these films insina the reality of a school for wizards and Muggles who inpedem Harry Potter to go to school because his stepmother was envy that her son was not chosen I am a big fan of this film parabens daniel-harry / emma-Ermione / and everyone who participated in this so amazing movie!
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitalol oh harry boy you will lose everthing
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaBELLATRIX LESTRANGE. :D:D<br><br>Favourite book. Favourite movie. ;)
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaI love the Order of the Phoenix it&#39;s my favorite one in the Series!! Hermoine breaks the rules I mean who doesn&#39;t wanna see that?
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler
y6ZW7KXaXYkdelimeterByIshitaIf i&#39;m not mistaken wasn&#39;t J.K. Rowling considering order of the phoenix to be the last Harry Potter book? I don&#39;t maybe it was just me but at the end of this trailer I thought Harry was dead for sure when Voldemort said that line.(Harry Potter you will loose everything) Totally made my heart skip a beat.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaDolelin
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaMaybe it&#39;s another name for Boogie Man. Once you believe he&#39;s real you can&#39;t get rid of him.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie last night, first Sundance movie I&#39;ve been to. It did not disappoint. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaI must see it. Looks quite good. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks scary as hell<br>
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s 1 o&#39;clock at night when I watched this.... Big mistake<br>
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaBabadook... what the hell kinda name is that
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaO_O<br><br>HOLY SHIT. THIS looks scary.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitahope the monster looks very creepy and not sum guy with a knockoff freddy kruger costume kinda like the books art on it hairy, fat, top hat, smiling like the cat from alice in winderland and them big ol eyes ooooooh thats creepy
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaKind of looks lke a shitter version of sinister..
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaKind of looks lke a shitter version of sinister..
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s a babadook? 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaDamn this actually looks scary, i haven&#39;t felt creeped out of scared even at all since the first Insidious and even that was fleeting in it&#39;s creepiness. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitadefinitely not as scary the second time you watch the trailer
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitalooks boring
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitamy question is why did she read this story to her kid it clearly isn&#39;t appropriate for a child that age! Bad parenting!
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaHella scurry son.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising...
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaYoooooo that is feaky..
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThis is &quot;The Boogeyman&quot;. How I would&#39;ve envisioned it, instead of that not really boogeyman, but it&#39;s called boogeyman because they wanted to make money, movie.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaSequel: The Mamabook
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaparece ser legal.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitashat my pants
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaFinally! A horror movie that looks genuinely disturbing.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThe Babadook...WHAT A FUKING JOKE!
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaFinally some nice horror comming up<br>
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaDont let it in dont let it in dont let it in dont let it in dont let it in dont let it in........   THAT Voice  is realy funny but the BabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaDoooooook is not xD

k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaNope
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWow It looks good! :D
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitainteresting
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWhat kind of children&#39;s book is that? Also, I lost interest at &quot;you can bring me the boy&quot;.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaJust judging from a trailer, the trend might be going toward the german expressionism.   A few cuts remind me &quot; Dr Calgari &quot; . 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitababablacksheep
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5WQZzDRVtw&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a> hi mom 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks shit
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThat kid needs a haircut. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m a Skatman!&quot;<br>&quot;BA BA BA BADA BAD BABADOOK&quot;
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitathank God its not another college blood and nudity filled not scary horror, Looks great
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaBabadook sounds like baby babble
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWhere did you get the incestuous bit
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaBAM!  Oh just a cat.  Wait, I didn&#39;t see that.  Hmm.  Might be ok.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaBabadook is an ancient ghost character lived between 1340 to 1345 in ( Khorasan ) the modern Afghanistan/ Kabul city / dehsabz valley . i had a bood about it, even my grand father used to talk about it, i am sure the name was tooked from that story, that ghost was a demon kind&#39;a ghost, which used to called in old Pushto language - Baba drond - which really means mr heavy and if we go for more detail&#39;s about the name the word Drond has another meaning too in Pushto ( national language of afghanistan ) which means ( Demonic ) and the word Baba means ( father or an old man ) which show the ghost or the demon was inside an old man at that time.<br><br>His story was interesting i know a little about it most of Afghan&#39;s dont know about it because people used to believe if the they talk about it ( baba drond ) will bother them too, my grand father know&#39;s it cause his father&#39;s and grand father&#39;s told him and fortunately i am from that place- dehsabz valley, so i know a little about it.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWhat in the world of BABADOOK is ? Is it scarier that Slenderman ?
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitawhat has mamadook turned into
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitalol its Where the Wild Things Are for adults 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5WQZzDRVtw&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> NOOOOOOOOOPE
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaGo Aussies!
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitathis looks okay. id see myself going to see it instead of devils due..
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaAt last, a horror film that actually looks cinematic.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitato me, any horror film that involves children is extremely disturbing......and in way I think its design that way, trying not to scare us as adults, but to scare the little children that  every single one of us have in our hearts.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitahow come everybody floating in scary movies now
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitacuando se estrena?
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the best horror film of 2014 thus far.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this garbage?
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been losing faith in horror films because of all the rehashed slasher/ghost/demonic movies providing cheap scares, but I got a different feeling from this one. I hope it scares the shit out of me when I watch it 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks pretty scary
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s see, we&#39;ve had demonic houses, demonic treasures, demonic paintings, demonic dolls, demonic video games, demonic video tapes, demonic 8mm film, demonic phone calls, demonic jewelry boxes, and now demonic children&#39;s books. Stay tuned for demonic homework, demonic crossword puzzles, and demonic goldfish.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaAs much of a damn chicken I am I love scary stuff lol I hate the direction horror movies have been going since I was a little boy though, more about sex and blood and killing for the sake of having those things than horror. I love that these more classic creepy-ass-monster/ghost movies are making a comeback lol
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaI think this looks different from all the usual horror movies out there! Its not concentrating on special effects or gore to get its point across, but more of the fear that we make in our own mind! It looks really interesting to me
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaTrailer spoils to much of the movie 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaOoh looks scary<br>
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaNice one ;)
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaHmmmm FREAKY....
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWoman: You&#39;re stalking me and trespassing my house!<br>Monster: It&#39;s what I do.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaShe doesn&#39;t realize its a messed up duck that says &#39;baba&quot; like a sheep. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like some scary shit!!!
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaLooks really very interesting,
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitait funny cause , in my country there was a dictator named PAPADOCK 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaBaba...Booey... 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaim not relly impressed but i do enjoy children/ demon movies lol
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitahoo look really creepy
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaChanging my Gamertag to Babadook
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaEvery horror movie, theres a BIG FUCKIN HOUSE that gets haunted or raided. I dont understand...
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good. But it seems like it&#39;s going to drag out problems with the child before showing the monster..
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaHey i know that guy , hes from where the wild things are 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWho da hell would get a book like that for their child anyways ? 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaOh c&#39;mon.... it&#39;s Insidious 3.
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWhy would his mother read him that book? Wtf is wrong with her?
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaCreepy. I like it
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaJust read this kind of story to your child and still be astonished he gets behaviour troubles...
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaomg
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s like the Boogeyman
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaum. Mommy? O_O
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaAgreed
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaYet another shallow generic horror movie.. :-/
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThe poor dog will die first...
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaIm gonna go ahead and say, the mom freaks out over her husband&#39;s death and shes the babadook
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitahuh doesnt seem very scary
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaDun Leli lim 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist: it&#39;s actually directed by m night. 
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaWho would read that kind of book to a kid in the first place
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaomg it looks good . i like it already

k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitaThe monster, the alien and the baby
k5WQZzDRVtwdelimeterByIshitabullshit
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWatched it month ago already .-. early trailer ^^
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaelysium music!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitasheesh what a storyline .. and william hurt how many dystopic movies will he appear in!!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaGreat film... story, settings, visuals, all is a bit different then what we&#39;re used to see in movies nowadays. Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton were great, entire cast too. This kind of original visions deserves to be seen by more people... I&#39;m a bit tired of all those comic-book movies and mediocre franchises-sequels/prequels. 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaOh yeah, and bunch of retards think this is hunger games on a train.<br><br>LOL
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaLooks much better than bunch of mindless hollywood movies.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI really hope this isn&#39;t going to just be &quot;In Time&quot; (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/?ref_=nv_sr_1">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/?ref_=nv_sr_1</a>) on a train.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshita&quot;Hunger Games on a Train&quot; starring Captain America.<br><br>Pass.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitawas a good movie
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitathe winter solider hahahahah.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaIs this real life?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve already seen this movie with subtitles. The ending leaves you thinking.. This movie is amazing!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe first 45 minutes were awesome, the rest not so much.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitathey should rename the title THE TRAIN!!!!!!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaChris evans? watching it!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaHIDDEN MESSAGE MUCH LOLZ
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe reason this movie was released late is because the American distributers wanted to dumb down the plot because they felt it was too complex for Americans.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaLooks on level with snakes on a plane.  People living on a train.  The lower class (tail) wants to get towards the rich class (front).
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe State on a Train
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI tried to like it. But I couldn&#39;t. ..the plot was simple enough, the fights were ok....Idk what it was, I just couldnt enjoy it the way I was expecting to I guess.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitasame Trailer music from Elysium... interesting 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaBIOSHOCK: THE MOVIE!!!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI have already seen this, thanks for the trailer
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaBefore he pierced winter, he pierced snow.<br><br>Captain America 1.5
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshita๋Jamie Bell tho. I&#39;m here for him.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaLOOKS LIKE THE FIFTH ELEMENT ON A TRAIN.<br>BUT U REALLY SHOULD RELEASE MOVIES THE SAME TIME AROUND THE WORLD CAUSE THIS IS AVAILABLE ALREADY IN PLACES AND ALREADY UPLOADED ON TORRENT SITES. IF U GUYS DIDNT TRY FIDDLING AROUND WITH IT TO RE-EDIT IT THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT EARLIER.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is frikkin awesom! The director is a genius, so many feels and nice fight scenes, with a mind-blowing plot. Loved the movie. Gotta say ending was a little disappointing but no spoilers here. Definitely worth a watch in the cinemas.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaCaptain America will save you!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaaka the story if Cap fell instead of Bucky
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaGreat movie, but the ending left me hanging. :|
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaDear prodprod,<br> U know Why? <br><br>@__@ simply becoz the movie trailer won t give u the answers..
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe worst movie ever <br>Believe me
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaLooks great
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitai got to credit them they actully made a movie about traveling train experience
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaREMAKE.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaMan it would suck to be the one person on that train with motionsickness
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaExcellent movie 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshita75% CGI.... then 25% of the movie was made in a room (green screen)... that it? garbage!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe ending was a real let down and the fight scenes were lame.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI was rather confused about the ambiguous ending.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaFree at <a href="http://putlocker.bz">putlocker.bz</a> 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Hunger Games, ON A TRAIN.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaYou say people gonna die Annie?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWatch it! It&#39;s amazing and no, it is not a straight to dvd trash.<br>Loved it very much. A must.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s hulk when you need him
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaElysium on a train
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitasome webs already could download the torrent, and to be facts, its so boring, need patience to watch it 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaHow I wish the movie is as good as this trailer.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaFor those who&#39;ve seen it... fish slip.. All I&#39;m saying haha
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaDramatic twist the front is really the back :o 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaMy body is ready
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaTough premise to sell, ill watch it out of curiosity. 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaIs it true that they did reshoots and reedits to make it better for American audiences? I already seen this movie via what rhymes with Riot Stay but jus wondering if they are changing things? 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaSocial commentary via Science Fiction, the only question is can people see the deeper meaning 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaElysium on a train
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaTHANK GOD THIS IS FINALLY BEING RELEASED!!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWatched it long time ago<br>Really good movie and very underrated <br>See this this summer  instead of garbage like Transformers and 22 jump street 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaok at least 80 % of the movie is about inside or around the train. guess the trailer were showing all the necessary scenes. i dont need to watch it :D
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know if they cut the time down?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaa very intense version of hunger games =D
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaOkay, civilization has collapsed, it&#39;s the middle of a new ice age, and you&#39;ve got the survivors of the world gathered on this self-contained atomic (or whatever) powered train that continually goes around the world and never stops that&#39;s a microcosm of society.<br><br>Can someone please explain to me why they hell they&#39;re on a train? Why a train? Does anyone have any idea the kind of vast on-going maintenance is required to keep a rail bed, the rails, the switches, the bridges, clear working and functioning?<br><br>How, with all of civilization gone, are they able to do this? And even if they could do it, &quot;why* are they doing it?<br><br>Why not simply find someplace, like a town or a city or a cave or a mine shaft, or just about anyplace and just stay there?<br><br>Why is everybody on a train, rolling along on tracks that could fail or be blocked,  going through tunnels that could fail or be blocked, going over bridges that could fail or be blocked?<br><br>Why?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitai saw this movie on my birthday, it was good but not suitable for my birthday 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitagreat movie horrible ending
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitadunno why all the fuss bout this movie, i actually like it, the plot is actually original and different, kinda tired of all the cliche on hollywood
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThis movie was an absolute, load of rubbish.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitathe plot is not new but...all this in a train that contains the last bit humanity ???? who thought of this? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ingenious, or didn&#39;t know what else to do? But it certainly caught my attention by how different setting for the film
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaGood movie, bad ending.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaapparently, if you grow a beard you can be untouchable...
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe foreign movie market is actually been good lately. The Raid 2 for example is better then most action movies Hollywood does.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaLooks okay, but i dont get the plot really.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe source material is a comic book so some people might find it a little cheesy. The only thing I didn&#39;t really like about it is the incongruous scale of the train. Whenever we see an aerial view of it, or hear it described by the characters, it&#39;s massive. However it shrinks drastically whenever we&#39;re actually inside of it. It&#39;s an entertaining movie nonetheless. 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI beat Chris Evans dies a the end..In almost all of his best best movies he dies lol, Sunshine, Puncture, Ice Man, Scott Pilgrim, lol
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good movie. Not more than that in my opinion* Definitely not a trash!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaReal good movie
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI watch it and for all who didnt ,this is worst movie Chris Evans,its so stupid story and movie is so boring....nothing new....
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaCaptain America looks very different with a beard.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI believe I speak for everyone when I say<br>&quot;What a sket&quot;
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitathe trailer is the whole movie lol
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaAnother Weinstein exclusive filled with guns and violence, and that fat douche has the nerve to talk about gun control. Looks good though. 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaIf only he had his shield-.-
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaHow are they not affected by the motion of the train moving - especially one moving that fast, through rough terrain as well, I would at least expect some bumps and shaking...
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe movie was OK, but it had some illogical elements. The placement and settings of the wagons for example. Entertaining, but not great.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThe concept sounds very promising and interesting, I&#39;ve just heard the execution is off
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWait...I thought this had already been released?  How did I see this already?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaSo u can make a movie out of anything i guess 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitamovie has been torrented for at least a month or more, it brings the term &quot;child labor&quot; to a new level.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWhen does this come out? I didn&#39;t say at the end
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaokay wasn&#39;t this suppose to come out like two years ago?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThis was an awesome movie. Loved it!
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaSo much expectation, so little satisfaction.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitathe plot couldn&#39;t be more ridiculous. CG was awful. Tilda Swinton was the best though.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaA great film, one great pile of symbolism, philosophy and entertainment.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how this just now getting a US trailer release?  Has it been locked up in production hell or something?  Is it that bad?
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaUsing the Elysium trailer music, which is cool because they have the same sort of topic.<br>I enjoyed this film.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t marketing people get that trailers should just tease you with cool moments and give a general idea of the plot, instead of giving 2 minute versions of the movie
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaWicked film. Loved it! 
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitastraight to DVD trash
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaSomehow I&#39;ve already seen this. I actually really enjoyed it, different from anything I&#39;ve seen lately.
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaHey, If you like movies and everything around the cinema, you may want to visit our Channel !<br>We´re new, we´re motivated and we would be very happy if you check us out (nohomo) :D
nX5PwfEMBM0delimeterByIshitaThis movie was so awesome.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.... Pretty much! Dope tho...
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaWith the same title written by Marcus lutrell himself
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaTacotwodays it&#39;s a true story and there&#39;s already a book
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaFreedom is the only way now
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshita&amp; take your butt buddy babak with you!!
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshita26 Taliban did not like this movie....
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaWOw.. that actually looks decent !
and it has Marky Mark :)
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaT4U--
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be a depressing movie
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitabreddy gud, needs more goats though.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitalooks great
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaDoes that mean everyone dies but Mark Wahlberg? Well.. good choice of a title.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshita3,000 died on 9/11, 100,000+ have died because of USA since (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc), and for what &#39;war on terror&#39;, NO, did it for OIL. 
USA only stick their noses in something if they are likely to gain something, not because they are the good guys or heroic. If that was the case they would have stop Israel by now.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaI have been waiting for this movie forever. And for all the trolls, read the book. Its the true story about survival not killing.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaBen affleck should take the lead

yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaBen foster has my trust that this is something worth watching
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaSending liberty by bullets
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitatypical good guys Americans versus Bad Guys Arabs, the sad truth is that there have been many cases of American soldiers abusing their power and killing innocent civilians and I want a film that tackles the dark side of war instead of the countless heroic American soldier movies. 


yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaBy watching the trailer it&#39;s pretty obvious they didn&#39;t kill the innocent civilian, but they probably should&#39;ve.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaAmericans win in the End.... Period!
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitacoming again to save the mother fucking day
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitasoooooo let me get this clear...it&#39;s a movie about how american soldiers go to a foreign country to kill people (I remark people, including that kid which they wanted to kill, not only taliban/terrorist/whatever), and this people DARE to fight them back, so they kill them all, and THEY ARE HEROES... hell yeah!!!!!! god bless America, and all its bulwarks of freedom
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaI only watch good movies and I have never heard of any of them. Thanks though.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see this movie!
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitai saw taylor kitsch, ben foster, erica bana, and emile hirsch. you should watch more movies
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaOh, so you&#39;re the person who saw Battleship. Must have been very lonely.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaForget the cast, people, forget the propaganda. Watch the movie and learn their TTPs. These actors are taught by real SEALs, real snipers(technical advisors). They make sure the actors do it as real as possible, without compromising secrets. Learn from them. If you&#39;re just wanting some gun entertainment...go watch some COD videos. If you want to see what you maybe up against, someday? Tears of the Sun, Shooter and even Blackhawk Down, the actors were taught to act/react like the real operators.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaThey are definatley not a bunch of nobody&#39;s, watch these movies; Troy, and Battleship
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaSpread the freedome! MURICA!
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitafuck yeah
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaYou must be a casting agent or something to know that bunch of nobodies! Congratulations!
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaHold on...in the trailer they decide to let the civilian go. Did u even watch all of it. 
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t sure what this was until 37 seconds in and then I heard &quot;Red Wing&quot; and then I was like oh... that&#39;s what we are doing
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaMarcus lutrell was a coward and a murderer.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaCorrection: i did not say it was a great cast, AND i have heard of more of the cast than just mark , he is a good actor and all but there are others in the movie that i really like! 
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at the end? I know it&#39;s a cover of the David Bowie song &quot;Heroes&quot; but by who?
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaTaylor Kitsch, Eric Bana, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch. I&#39;d say they&#39;re pretty well known.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaThis is the cheesiest trailer
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaBecause AQ killed several thousand Americans on 9/11 ... or did you forget?
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaHow can you say that when Marky Mark is the only person in this movie anyone&#39;s heard of?
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaMURICA
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at the end of the trailer? who is it by
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshita¿Bravo Two Zero american way?
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitayes everyone in the movie! :D
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FUK, OPERATION RED WINGS, MICHEAL MURPHY, MEDAL OF HONOR, NAVY SEALS.

yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaHave you ever seen Afghanistan? Lots of forest.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitawhoa what? you talking about this movie?
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaMark Wahlberg is the lead actor in this movie.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaits mostly forest and mountainous in Afghanistan,thats why it such a hard place to wage warfare.the desert is easy.
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitathe title makes me worry for all the other guys apart from mark wahlberg..
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitatypical we proud of usa army movie crap all done before
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitathis is the most cringe worthy film, obviously paid for by the DoD just a military ad. Pile of shit.; 
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaNope
yoLFk4JK_RMdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or does the environment of a forest really not setting for a film like this.

d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaDANES ASSEMBLE
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaThis is original, and fits with the times, despite being placed in a world years before ours. The concept is fantastic, this movie looks phenomenal.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaMore like The Danish Caitlyn Jenner.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaAlicia is my dream girl

d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI can smell Oscar bait...
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaVIKANDDEERR, sorry broken caps lock. Even without her, I&#39;m sold the moment whishaw kissed redmayne. Please do tell me Schoenaerts kiss Redmayne or whishaw too.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaHA! GAAAAAAAAAAAY!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaEddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander. Two of the most talented actors of their generations. The movie looks gorgeous. I can&#39;t wait to see it.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaOh hell nah
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaGave away like 2/3 of the movie
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaWho agrees that Alicia Vikander is going to be huge after the 2015 oscars? Like HUGE.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally the Jared Leto of 2015
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaamazing story, amazing scenario, great acting, incredible director of photography and excellent director..I&#39;m looking forward to.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaHollywood is really pouring on the homoganda these days aint they?
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaPingu had to come along and spoil everything!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaAnd this is how 2015 started the transgender awareness. Eddie is such an incredible actor, I hope Oscars will rain.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitahow incredibly stupid. the fact that its based off a &quot;true story&quot; makes it worse.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks gorgeous.Don`t bet against Eddie winning his second Oscar in a row.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitalooks good another Oscar for Eddie redmayne
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaABOMINATION SACRILEGE  !!!!!!! SACRILEGE !!!!!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshita52th
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else feel like some movies are made FOR the Oscars now?
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait !!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer revealed way too much. grrr
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaUgh can we stop with this transgender trend already! I am in full support of the LGBT community but it&#39;s as if this topic is getting exploited now
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaIs Alicia Vikander just in everything now?
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaOscar!!!!!!!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaEddie&#39;s going to get another Oscar<br>-A,x
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaCool story bro.. em sis.  Eh whatever you want to be called
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaAcademy Award for sure
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaHello, Eddie. How YOU doin&#39;?
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaGAYYY AF
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d88APYIGkjk&amp;t=1m36s">1:36</a> PUTIN ????
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaUhm so at the award ceremony... will he be at the male category or female category? lol jk
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI doubt the film will get nominated. Its likely that redmayne will, because he is convincing in his portrayal. Presumably he doesn&#39;t really enjoy cross dressing, but you&#39;d really believe he did after watching this trailer.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitalooks boring
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaYou get an Oscar! And you get an Oscar! Everybody gets an Oscar!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaWe don&#39;t have British accents in Denmark.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaFuture Oscar winner Alicia Vikander ❤
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaYep, looks like he&#39;ll win an Oscar again... :\
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based on a  book that came out in 2000 and it is set in Denmark in the early 1920&#39;s as you can see from the period costumes so it HARDLY has anything to do with Ciatlyn/Bruce Jenner since the movie started filming like over a year ago LONG before Jenner came out and decided to start dressing like a woman. Why all the negative comments about this movie? If you do not like the subject matter just don&#39;t go to see it....end of story!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaohh finally!!! I can&#39;t wait to watch it CX I love the subject and Eddie Redmayne. Perfection! 😍😆😆🎇🎇
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitawell she started it
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshita<b>sniff sniff</b> do you smell that? That smells like an Oscar Nomination!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI hope he tucked
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s likely going to be Eddie dicaprio and hopefully Tom hardy going at it this Oscar!!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaHe/She dies....  Now you don&#39;t need to see it, thank me later.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks like it could be interesting...God I just hope Eddie Redmayne can make up for his atrocious performance in Jupiter Ascending...everything about that was so bad...
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI CREATE LIFE!!!!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaJessica Chastain???
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaUm.....what did i just watched?....
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here to see Alicia Vikander&#39;s career take off. If she isn&#39;t nominated for Ex Machina then I am done with the Oscars.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaHey, I find him/her beautiful.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaWow - another gay movie in 2015. I guess film industry really wants to find out whether you can get a big audience for homomanic crap...
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshita20/20 bet there will be more trans than this world has ever seen before.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaomg why is eddy redmayne so perfect in every role :o
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaBruce Jenner The moive.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaSoon to be Academy Award nominee Alicia Vikander, judging by this trailer... hoping.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks silly but I think hooper is going to direct the sh*t out of it. He specializes in directing characters suffering through a problem like he did in The King&#39;s speech. Dicaprio is gonna watch Eddie go out with the Oscar one more time.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks soo good.<br>And eddie redmayne, is gorgeous, be it as a lady or as a man. i am dying to watch it unless someone tells me that this is inspired by CIATLYN JENNER&#39;s story :P
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitathis will be an emotional ride and might as well be another Oscar for Eddie. and maybe even Alicia. she&#39;s very talented!
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaoh my god this is gonna amazing
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitacatlyn jenner movie, looks interesting without all the kardashian stuff
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE YOU EDDIE 
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitai threw up a lil bit..
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitawhat a stupid pile of propaganda crap.
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitashe wants the polse
d88APYIGkjkdelimeterByIshitaFirst
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping this was gonna be a good movie... Not Looking that way.. It&#39;s like someone decided combining Evil Dead and The Truman Show together would be a good idea. Hopefully the Evil Dead Remake will be made and actually good.

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTOPHER!!!!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaScooby doo part 4 without scooby.

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitalol &quot;Bad things happen.&quot; 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@TheAwesomeo5001 YES
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawell Joss whedon&#39;s got his name attached sooo it may not be a masterpiece necessarily, but it will be creative as hell.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@Cakevspie94 The Naked and Famous - Young Blood
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaanybody think evil dead at the cabin parts
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at the very beginning?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@TheAwesomeo5001 lol
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawats the song at 1:45?

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is wrong with the blonde? O_o
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else go &quot;TOPHER&quot; 8seconds in?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaFor some of the people comparing this to recent movies... This was actually set to release two years ago, but MGM went bankrupt and it&#39;s been sitting around since then. Check your facts first please!

And Hemsworth alone is enough :P
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaEVIL DEAD????
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@neonguitar888666 yeah I have. I about to read them again actually. I know their in two different times and these aren&#39;t children competing and they aren&#39;t forced to kill each other but I was referring to the fact that they are in a game of life and death and that the person who is watching them can control things that are happening.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitayou could see that everybody is going to die -___-
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaHEY LOOK ITS TOPHER 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTHE MUSCLE
THE DUMB BLOND
THE BRAINS
THE SCARED ONE
THE ONE GUY WHO FIGURES EVERYTHING OUT BUT NO ONE ELSE BELIVES HIM
SECRET GOVERNMENT PROJECT!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@BbubblyJ They&#39;re not at all similar. Have you even read the books... 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaYES!!! Joss Whedon is a fuckin genius and im so fuckin excited for this movie to come out!!!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitathis is like fallout
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThis kind of reminds me of &quot;Tuck and Dale vs. Evil&quot;
:D
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitai like the shaggy rogers character when the guy is like &quot;lets split up*. his like &quot;fuck that!&quot; XD
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThor will save their asses right before joining the Avengers xD
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@AlexAnthonyG I Fucking know right!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitayeah what is that song

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaJesse Williams!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawhats that song playing after 1:30 it totally reminds me of Marilyn Manson. Does anyone know?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Let&#39;s split up.&quot; wtf is this scooby doo?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaDont worry they got Thor! :D
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@Bobby116212able That&#39;s the very first thing I&#39;d thought as well when I saw it LOL. :-)
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaHow come the good guys never think about taking guns with them when they are going to some remote/strange location?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaI saw this preview high and the first thing I noticed was that everything that guy at 1:26 said was exactly in the same tone. 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitatopher from dollhouse, he&#39;ll solve it
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTotally not what i expected lol 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@TheAC420 The &quot;secret&quot; they revealed is in like first minutes of the movie and trust me....They didnt give much away! Its still surprising,interesting, and totally awesome!!! Its a breath of fresh!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWay to show the whole movie again TRAILERS!...
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaJesse Willaims is gottt damn ! (;
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaKinda reminds me of Scooby doo in a way xP
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@tubernery LMAO
Exactly!

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaOkay two actors in them film, look like the younger versions of Owen Wilson and Uma Thurman.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitathis kind of looks like it sucks.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaso....we pretty much knew the plotline, the survivors and the monsters from the trailer...are you going to throw 11 bucks in the box office for a story you already know
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThis... looks terrible.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@whailman Oh my goodness! Why not? Did my comment upset you? I&#39;m sorry! I was just saying  that the two movies are really similar! Are you going to be okay? You can so talk to me about anything!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@BbubblyJ I don&#39;t want to live on this planet anymore.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@lllenjolll Ohmy! You read my mind. Lol. 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThis is a What If Thor never regained his powers story.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@53Spawn
SPOILER 2!!
Shaggy and the ginger are the last 2 alive, likely the ginger dies.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitai want to seee this
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how I should feel about this movie.  It seemed good until I saw that it was being controlled...  Could be good or could be extremely terrible like recent horror movies.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaSo do our Players get Weapons to defend themselfs with? 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTHIS really looks like a good movie finally people are trying something else than the usual horror flick 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaI.WILL.SEE.THIS.MOVIE. O.O
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@ShiroToshi thank you!!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaso what the heck was she doing to that wolf?!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaI think they&#39;ll be o.k. They have Thor there to protect them.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@simdude2u Young Blood by The Naked and Famous
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at 00:07 ??
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitalooks like him to...is it him?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitablonde hippie sounds like shaggy...
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like some mocking of horror movie cliches are in Whedon&#39;s script.  Win.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita... I don&#39;t know. Maybe
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitalooks like a manipulated environment where a government/movie crew is controlling what happens to them, thereby making the perfect training cabin/movie about 5 teens going to the cabin in the woods.

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhat is really going to intimidate Thor? I mean come on!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@53Spawn I noticed that too, at least with the blonde.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@53Spawn I noticed that too, at least with the blonde.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTHOR!!!!!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of the Korean movie A Million. But still looks good.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a unique film. Can always count on a totally different twist on a cliche&#39;d idea from Joss Whedon. Lookin forward to it!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitathis kind of remind me of the old movie evil dead.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitathey already showed who survives? that sucks.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaOne word. SICK! This looks awesome! I wana see it.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s MANBEARPIG!
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@taylor1hp Unfortunately not much, but as soon as I find out you&#39;ll be the first to know.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song that plays in the beginning 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell? Is it like a government experiment?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhat is with all the hate for this movie? I think it looks like a fun ride. I&#39;ll buy a ticket.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaThis is so rip off of The Hunger Games! Like why would Lion Gate produce two movies so similar together?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaShit! Kind of cool looking, might consider going to see it! 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@dreadred92 pale imitation? naah. not really. If you read HG trilogy. it&#39;s more than survival games. story&#39;s not as game concept-centered as Battle Royale.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@lllenjolll No, like Battle Royale. Hunger Games are only recognized as a pale imitation. 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
oh man
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaTypical, lame, overdone-oh Joss Whedon? Awesome.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitalook pretty good, but i barely have any fate in American horror film much anymore after the fail of The Darkest Hour.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaWhen he says &quot;lets split up&quot; I say &quot;hell no don&#39;t you know horror movie 101?&quot;
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaSilent Hill?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitathe part when that one guy said &quot;lets split up&quot; i immedeatly thought &quot;SCOOBY-DOO TIME XD&quot;
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@lulie908 Joss Whedon got his start subverting horror cliches with Buffy. I&#39;m not going to make any predictions on who survives. I do predict, however, that the monsters/bad guys are going to die like bitches.
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawow. survival games? like hunger games?
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita@lulie908 wow....how insightful -__-
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitawatch i can predict this movie, the only one to survive is one of the girls becuz ther boyfrend sacraficed ther life for her and the first one to die is the stupid blond girl and everyone else just dies somewher inbetween those 2

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaUp until the video stuff and barrier I really thought that this was for like Friday the 13th two or something. 
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitanot feelin it
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitaOH SHIT! They&#39;ll run out of booze...
NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshita...so is that supposed to be the Cabin from Evil Dead?

NsIilFNNmkYdelimeterByIshitashit look stupid

i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaahah, 27 years old = 59 years old , interesting movie. This is not only funny but also meaningful film. The inside is most important and forever :)
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitahaha yeah well zeta stands for the letter &quot;z&quot; in the Greek alphabet though, and it&#39;s also a rather common Greek female name. Who cares if anyone has been using it for over a hundred years. It&#39;s like saying I&#39;m gonna trademark the name Mary or the letter Z.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI gotta say I thought this film was gonna be terrible but I ended up really enjoying it. It had several memorable lines(the &quot;eyes are the nipples of the face&quot; line got me laughing to tears), anna faris was brilliant and the whole &quot;be yourself&quot; routine did not feel half as forced as I expected. Overall I give it a matinée for what it is : a light-hearted comedy best watched with friends and served with a couple of steaming pizzas.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaseen it about 2 weeks ago, &#39;twas fucking awesome! lo
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitalmfao
i saw this movie...
FUKING AMAZING!
you guys need to see it! hahaahhaha
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaYOU JUST GOT PWNED
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshita-Their last mother was hospitalized with halusinations.-

-Awesome.-


haha.
xD
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitahahaha the ending &#39;i won&#39;t listen to what simon says..he is so mean&#39;.....&#39;oh u meant the president&#39; hahaha
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaThe Z that falls on her head in the preview, if you noticed is foollowed by TA... as in ZTA.  The ZAZ that is sported in the movie is indeed the main color of ZTA.  Basically all greeks are known by some short form of their name, ZTA are Zetas.  It just happens they trademarked their name.  Smart of them.  I&#39;m afraid they have a case.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI am going to name my fraternity &quot;THE&quot; that way anytime someone uses &quot;THE&quot; in a movie I can sue them!!! Muhahaha!! Brilliant!!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaKatharine McPhee looks HILARIOUS!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitashutup bitch! Fuck zta !!!!!!!!!!! go Kappa kappa kappa!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaIf this bitch dont get naked I aint watching this shit!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshita-scary v0ice-
HarmOny.


lOl.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI think it is wrong that they are using ZTA&#39;s copyrighted property to promote their movie. Why couldn&#39;t they use a fictitious organization (like the Omega Moos!). Boo to you, Sony Pictures.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!!  lol  looks so good.... except for Rumer Willis being in it. ~hurl~
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI totally understand where you are coming from. I myself am a member of a sorority and we are AST. That is our nickname that we adopted and in the Greek community we are the only ones who have it out of respect. ZETA is reserved for ZTA, but you have to be a member of a sorority to understand why it is so important and why this is a big issue.Only the women who are in the organizations know what they are really like. This movie is degrading to what we do as organizations.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitakatharine mcphee looks damn fine in this movie
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaYou are the exercist, thats great.

LOL
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaOh, get over yourself.  At :50 you can CLEARLY see the imprint of an E proving it said ZETA.  The letters fall down to add some humor.  Zeta is a letter of the alphabet that you and your sorority do not own.  You guys are the ones making a mockery of yourselves by making such a big deal over it.  It&#39;s really lame and you guys aren&#39;t going to win any case claiming a Greek letter as yours.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaag423, i see where you&#39;re coming from. Just laugh at yourself! Really you should want to see the movie cause it uses the same name as your sorority. 
Take it with a pinch of salt maggie.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaMy grammar is just fine thank you. I didn&#39;t feel the need to write grammatically correct just to please you. Thanks for your concern though. I am a college student, a pre-law one in fact. And believe it or not I am a ZETA!! We have adopted the nickname over the years b/c it has all three of our letters in the word &quot;Zeta&quot;. I guess you wouldn&#39;t understand the respect issue or lack there of in this situation. If we do lose, we&#39;ll take our dignity with us. PS if you pause it at :50 you&#39;ll see ZTA!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaNO! You get over yourself! They did not pick a familiar letter... good one though. If you would put your ignorance aside for a min and pause the trailer at :50 you&#39;d see why we&#39;re are so upset about this. I don&#39;t care if you think I am crazy that i don&#39;t want this to hit theaters. It degrades everything that my sorority&#39;s founders worked SO hard to accomplish. Are you a Zeta? and did you get the email about the legal action we are taking?? NO DIDN&#39;T THINK SO! we gotta stick together sopralto89!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshita&quot;ahh that is freakin hot&quot;

lol...def gonna watch this
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks hilarious!

katharine mcphee even looks beautiful preggers. i love her!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a shit version of the first 30 minutes of legally blonde!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never really seen her in a serious movie... which is good cause she&#39;s just hilarious.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaAnna Faris is HOTTTT!!!
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks hilarious.
And then it having Anna Faris, Colin Hanks, Tyson Ritter, and Katharine McPhee in it...that&#39;s just awesome.
i-RmuzppVuMdelimeterByIshitaKATHARINE MCPHEE LOL


HOOT!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI knew there was a reason I liked her in hunger games so much .... sapphic energy
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaMuy bonita pero a la vez demasiado triste que no hayan quedado juntas.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI am so engrossed by the acting and the chemistry of these actresses. The little looks and lip bite and gestures are just so real. It&#39;s not the ending that I&#39;m hoping for but they are both happy and its reassuring to know that you will have the love of your life and bestfriend with you to support you matter what. But i keep wishing that Sarah did something more to be with Mindy... it feels like Mindy is just waiting for Sarah to accept who she is and how she feels for Mindy. Also Mindy&#39;s mom may know what&#39;s up, or maybe not. Haha. Im gonna have my own ending for this movie in my head. Alt ending: after 3 years, Mindy and Lief will be separated. Mindy will come clean and it will not be a messy separation. All is good is Mindy and Sarah universe as it should be. Lief will find someone who can love him completely. Haha.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaNice change from the Bastard out of North Carolina movie for Jenna Malone...
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaPlease! The BSO of this movie!!!!!🙏
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaBooooooooooring.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaEsse filme é bom?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s worth watching, even just for those little intimate moments.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSo, Ellen hasn&#39;t invited the protagonists of this beautiful story and indi film yet, but did it so with those from Call Me by Your Name? And Ellen said she loves and support indies. Well, I watched both films and Lovesong its way more romantic, and less presomptuous, but we know hollywood it controlled by gay-Jewish men, so, what can we expect?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaand another, and another... gay movie.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI hate this movie😭😭😭😭..that&#39;s not fare😭😭<br>Come on guys,sometimes we need happy endings.. Come on..😭😭😭
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathis is just ugly, dont watch this, waste of time
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaAlguien me ayudaría con el nombre  de la música que sale al final de la película? Plisss
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaNo está en español?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFuck that im never getting married cant trust this shit.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFuck this movie! Don&#39;t even bother! So sick of these types of films ending in either tragedy or... what ever the hell this was supposed to be. What little chemistry these two had was overshadowed by an annoying 3-year-old.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaIt looks not happy in the end @.@
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is beautiful. Watch it people, it&#39;s sad, but beautiful. Great performances too. I will never get over the ending though.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaThey are so good together. I need Jena Malone working with Riley Keough again!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathe chemistry between this two was just unbearable god i need part 2 so badly or just anything with jenna and riley together
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaalguém sabe o nome da música que toca no bar quando elas estão dançando na despedida de solteira da Mindy... é romântica
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathe beginning reminded me of room
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathe song is What we are following - iluminas
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaThis could be the cutest saddest lesbian story i&#39;ve seen in a while, both actresses were so great
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshita(|)q: 😍 :p(I)
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaExcellent film. Captivating performances, honest storytelling. These <br>women are so skilled. Not a fairy tale, not a tragedy...just real and <br>painful choices in the midst of an understated,  powerful love.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaits a very beautifull movie i loved it ¡¡
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t be the only one that thinks they seriously look alike
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFor crying out loud, it&#39;s 2017 and their still writing lesbian movies like it&#39;s 1950.  If it had been a straight couple they would never have married. Get with the times, Indie....
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI knew she should&#39;ve hooked up with Katniss
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWatch <a href="http://vidzi.tv/q5ckyv0y82dx#.WSDoB4EpDYU">http://vidzi.tv/q5ckyv0y82dx#.WSDoB4EpDYU</a>
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaEsse filme não mostra quase nada entre elas, mas diz tudo.. O que causa na gente é forte... Uau!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie. It made absolutely no sense, shitty ending, super cringe worthy improv. Literally 99% of the movie is improv and it&#39;s so bad.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFuck me. This movie is absolutely amazing. The biggest reflection is not will they won&#39;t they. It&#39;s bigger and it&#39;s beautiful.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so BEAUTIFUL!!! I&#39;ve seen it 3 days ago and still think about it all the time...
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI swear if this is some depressing shit with psycho lesbian tropes.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWell, this trailer promises next to zero interesting things to happen in this movie... but Jena Malone is wonderful. Perhaps the loveliest and most intriguing face in today&#39;s American cinema. Hope Neon Demon will inspire directors to cast this actress in some interesting movies - though she have already acted in Inherent Vice, Nocturnal Animals and Batman v Superman.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI need to watch this movie, but I don&#39;t think any theater near me will play it.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaAlguém sabe o nome da música que toca em <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqUcDru8plY&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a>? // Does anyone know the name of the song that plays at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqUcDru8plY&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a>?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitasomebody knows  the name of the song?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s your song ?<br>i love it
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWhere i can watch this movie?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitadont trust jena i mean ruby she will eat you
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaperhaps not a very good mom, after all.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaRiley 😚
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaThey should have cast Brooklyn Decker in Jena Malone&#39;s role
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathis one has a feeling of coming of age genre, ain&#39;t it? c:
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSince two years ago I only cheked the first 10 sec. <br>Now trailers means film&#39;s summary :/
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSecreto en la montaña, versión femenina?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaare they trying to make jena malone look old or is that how she looks without makeup
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitacan i have a happy, totally obvious, cute, lesbian movie. just once
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaJENA MALONE KISSING GIRLS IS ALL I NEED
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaJena Malone is so pretty.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaRiley Keough is so beautiful
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWhen I first saw American Honey I had to keep reminding myself that Riley Keough wasn&#39;t Jena Malone and now they&#39;re ex-lovers? This is gonna be too confusing.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaRiley Keough is Elvis&#39;s granddaughter.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitalooks great actually
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitacary fukunaga is there. so it&#39;s fine by me.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitathe girl from the girlfriend experience, could be good
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaTell me please, when does the movie come out?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSorry but after watching San Junipero, I don&#39;t think anything can beat that...
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWhat does she say at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqUcDru8plY&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a>?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaso another feminine women empowerment bullshit movie
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshita<b>This looks really good</b>
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaYou might as well throw in Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves in the topic as well, because they have as much to do with this movie as Will Smith.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitajohanna hunger games
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see Will Smith. He&#39;s not in the movie.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaLiars ! No will Smith in this movie !
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaOMG RILEY AND JENA SNATCH MY WEAVE!!!!!!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m happy to know that Will Smith is not in this film
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSeems like intriguing indie!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitastill looks good even if will Smith not in it in fact probably better because of it!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFYI - Jena Malone&#39;s name is misspelled in the description - there is no e at the end of her name.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSo is Will Smith directing?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitais it only me who is not seeing will smith??????
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI googled this film, and Will Smith has nothing to do with it!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaafter The Neon Demon i don&#39;t trust Jena Malone AT. ALL.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song? some one tell me. haha
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s brooklyn&#39;s big rack then?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSo this movie has nothing to do with Will Smith. So why add his name to the title?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS FILM SO GODDAMN MUCH!!! &lt;33
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWill Smith played the little girl with CGI. WTF?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in lesbians with Jena Malone
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitariley and jena!!im in!!!!
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaClicked because I saw Jenna Malone in the thumbnail
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Will Smith in this? wrong caption
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitanO RAGRETS..!!! Hmpph..
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWill smith probs directed it
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaSongs?
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaeven though will smith isnt in this.. this looks so good! hope it was a happy ending though..
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaJohanna Mason? Count me in.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshita... I shoulda known Will Smith wasn&#39;t in this since he isn&#39;t the screenshot. I deserve it, nice one, indie movie.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaits actually not Jena Malone... it&#39;s Will Smith.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWhere was will smith? HAHAHA but it&#39;s a lesbian movie so I forgive you for fucking up the title
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaFix the title
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaLove Jenna Malone. What she does with those eyes of hers is always amazing. Something sensual about her presents on screen too. Also, the music in the trailer is awesome. What is it? Also, Half Nelson is my favourite Indie/Drama. The music in the trailer reminded me of one of my favourite bands, Broken Social Scene, who did the soundtrack for Half Nelson.
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitawill Smith is not in the this movie
UqUcDru8plYdelimeterByIshitaWill Smith wasn&#39;t in this
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshita..this movie is still shit
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaeasily one of my favourite movies !
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe I&#39;ve only just watch this yesterday for the first time, three of Britain&#39;s finest actors Hardy, Elba, Butler in one movie
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitasuper hans!!!!!!
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaFavorite movie, can watch it over again and again! Guy Ritchie da best!
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaGoraneeeeee
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshita2021👑
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaFirst time I watched this.  I guess DeNiro must have paid Netflix to not show it till now... As this movie was so much better than any movie he was in
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaEat your heart out DeNiro...
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaCriminally underrated film.  More A-list talent than you could shake a stick at, and Guy Ritchie in top form behind the camera.  I loved it.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaHe, that&#39;s that started in that naughty set of bedsits 230 greenlane Heaton moor Stockport England, I saw johny quid in the 1 hour ago, swear to God.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaWhat exactly is a RockNRolla?
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaWatched it years ago. Didn’t fancy it. Just hit Netflix, time for a revisit 😼
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaBest Ritchie film.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaFavorite Britsh Rockstar portrayal.

TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaFuck it, im watching it again.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaIs it bad that I gain inspiration from this movie?! 😂😈
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitathe trailer they put for netflix is fuckn dog shit
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaBack when they had Idris Elba and Tom Hardy in a movie and they didn&#39;t bother to put their name in the trailer
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaGreat film. Wish we could&#39;ve gotten a sequel.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaI like Guy Ritchie film&#39;s I have on DVD <br><br>Aladdin<br>The gentleman<br>Lock stock and two smoking barrel&#39;s <br>The man from Uncle<br>Revolver<br>Rock n rolla  <br>Sherlock Holmes<br>Sherlock Holmes a game of Shadow&#39;s <br>Snatch
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdpR8VuvbCM&amp;t=2m18s">2:18</a>  what do you think we are ? Gangsters ? ....lmao
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThe life between raves. &quot;The rave is the wind down recovery afterparty.&quot; You know you have been to a rave when you have to go to a saturday nightclub to come down. Yeah They are trying to stop me. Melbourne...not in the 90&#39;s but the last 20 years. The group replaying all that and pretending to be after me is the problem. AND GIVING IT ALL TO SOMEONE ELSE. NEED TO HAVE THEIR THROAT CUT! ALL ILLEGAL. END OF STORY. Fuck your mislead manipulated democracy.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaLow audio
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaGüzel bir film şu anda izliyorum
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer i think reveals too much
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaAnd they never made a sequel to this as promised...Still waitng...
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaenglish people talk funny.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaCheck out my opening RockNrolla scene on tiktok<br><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/J6VeyDp/">https://vm.tiktok.com/J6VeyDp/</a>
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaNot enough Tom Hardy in this movie.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaIt’s funny seeing actors who had small parts I n this film but do now. Edris Elba. Back then he was only in some of the film . Now he’d be all over this trailer and the movie
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaRocknRolla is definitely much better movie than The Gentlement.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaWho else is reading all the comments with this British accent?
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshita11 years and no sequel. Life is cruel
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaNetflix brought me here
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaTom Wilkinson is totally miscast.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of them films I wish I could forget about n watch again
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaGuy Ritchie is just a one trick pony
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaFull movie Dalo yar
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitano
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a man
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitawtf this looks wack not gangsta and not funny
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaWat a stupid boring ass movie. They tried so hard to make this a hard ass gangster movie but it came out mad weak
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaOne of best movies
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Guy Ritchie wanted to do a satire of his own movies.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;ve waster 15 second of my live by adding this kind of intro to this trailer
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaTheres a part of me that still wants a followup but I get the feeling it will never live up to even a fraction of the style the original had
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the brand of the green polo Idris Elba has on towards end of this trailer?
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the coolest in the world.  From Thailand
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaOh yeah
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite clip will always be the way Archie opens doors when entering One twos house.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaGuy Richie...Aladdin WTF?
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaWould really cool to see Ritchie go back to making films like this
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaSo basically Guy Richie watched “Minder” and thought what a great premise for a movie
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdpR8VuvbCM&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a> &quot; No one cared who i was until i put on the mask&quot;
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the greatest Guy Ritchie movies ever! This trailer is complete shit! This actually makes me want to get into the trailer making business just so I can take their check! In fact stay posted for a better trailer
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaNotice Tom hardy is in it &quot;Fucking love Tom this could be a sick movie&quot;<br>See that Guy Ritchie has directet &quot;okay, okay the Tarantino-wannabe made a good movie like snatch but he also ruined the king Arthur story.. could go both ways&quot; <br>Realise Ludacris is in it..... &quot;FUCK NO&quot;
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaI want to see the sequel..good movie.2018.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie!!
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s no school like the old school and I&#39;m the headmaster.. classic line, so glad he got what for the arse

TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThen we&#39;ll throw in some adds and credits and call it a movie . pretty up for the cameras luv.
TdpR8VuvbCMdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s no school like the old school and i&#39;m the headmaster :) gangsta

YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitafelt Cilian Murphy was underused in this movie.Overall,it was a good effort
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitawhy no body think about hacking the system?
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaa guy i met at work recommended this to me. i should watch it i guess.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaMy English teacher recommended this movie.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaHoereacts brought me here.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaCame from instagram! Pubity brought me, completely forgot about this movie
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThe concept of this movie is amazing
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaPubity brought me here
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaTime is money
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI came here because I heard CongTv said &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; in one of viy&#39;s vlogs. I got curious in that term, so i googled it. Then, ended up searching for a movie with that kind of plot and this movie is on the top list.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWhy<br>Is<br>This<br>Trailer<br>Just<br>One<br>Massive<br>Spoiler
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshita<b>I was just randomly reminded abt this movie nd wanted to watch it</b>
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI realize it’s ~8 yrs too late but their is so much potential for ‘Young money’ jokes in this movie. I say that at the risk of it having been said before.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshita2019?
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaBest film
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitacheckout trailer game freedom wars
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI get that everyone stops ageing at 25, but is there a rule that says everyone is unnecessarily good-looking?
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI bet in the world of this movie there is at least one person that gives birth to children only to take their time. Looking at how much time babies have as shown in the movie and at the cruel world surrounding the movie.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s watching this on 2018 ?<br><br><br><br><br>If you want Sequel please press The Good Button.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should be called &quot;Time is Money&quot;
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWho wacth on 2017
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitagood  movie

YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitafinally found the name of this awesome movie, wanted to watch it again but didn&#39;t knew it&#39;s name..xaxa
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitawhere can I watch this show
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitadoes anybody know the movie where a woman puts on sunglasses and she could see the years of days time like this movie  till someone dies on the forehead
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWill Salas is Donald Trump and Philippe Weis is Ted Cruz
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t remember any explanation why they don&#39;t have PIN to lock their arms. Perhaps the genetic modification failed to provide them with a touch pad.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitathis movie reminds me of another movie I watched and its soo frustrating cuz I loved the other movie
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaSeems exactly like the world we live in today, no doubt people would kill you for more time just like they do for money.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone still remember this? e.e
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaMy life
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshita<br><br><br>
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie talks about how economics are rigged everywhere just replace that time stuff with money.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI would love to watch this movie on line, if u know where, please  let me know <br>thanks ! 
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie!
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaya ya ya he almost dies then they keep him alive they live happley ever after then comes sex and movie number 2 we all know how it goes
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI feel the same way about Kristen Stewart. The girl can&#39;t act. I have no idea why she is still getting roles. 
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitai shouldnt have watched this damn trailer !!!!
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaSoiled my pants :D

YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaPlease help me make this a top comment because through watching this movie, I learned how precious time is, and how wasteful my time was watching this movie. 

This movie makes no sense. The plot makes no sense, the acting makes no sense, the characters make no sense. One of those movies where you watch it with a friend and after its over no one talks for a couple minutes because everyone is sad.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWhy they continue to let justin timberlake take on any sort of acting role is beyond me.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitafacekut.com
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaIn time.. after this trailer im going to masterbate.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie didn&#39;t make much sense at all the only thing that was remotely close to working was the concept (wich I must admit was kind of cool, but the execution of it sucked b***s). I constantly got the feel scenes were missing that would explain the characters actions and their abilities (for example if your father was some kind of agent you inherit those abilities and become a pro poker-player/action-hero even if you&#39;re just some random guy). THIS MOVIE ISN&#39;T WORTH THE TIME
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshita    The mother in law is the hottest.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaI agree, although if he grew his hair, maybe grew a beard and went threw some speech classes to pull out a deeper voice he might have a shot... No one can look at him being a hero seriously with the boyish look. 
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaSTFUp Justin, no matter how much time goes by you still sound like a girl.He couldnt get any worthwile actors to act hin this movie so he went with the 25 rule. people can work up to the age of 40 with no problem but no 40 year old established actor would want your name shitting on his. Now go bring sexy back you moron.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitawhere do they get ideas for such movies, i wonder. hidden agenda. 
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaa movie created by hollywood who is mostly 1%&#39;s to have the 99%&#39;s hate the 1%&#39;s. yeah that makes a lot of sense.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaso robin hood then!...with time
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThe concept was good but for me justin timberlake should just stick to singing songs
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshita@Gary4500X hear hear!
yes everyone will die eventually, but not everyone must die in vain, the less fortunate would have had their rights were it not for the rich ppl who steal it from them. i agree though about this &quot;forever young&quot; / live forever concept, it&#39;s getting pretty boring, new organs, or using robots instead etc, creative but nothing new
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaDid someone clone the top comments and the accounts? is that even possible? this thing is so much more interesting than the entire movie lol. it was a super great idea, until the girl came into the picture and ruined it all to some shabby Bonnie and Clyde wannabe love story bite me!
this movie had such potential, they could have chosen better actors too and the movie would at least not have been as painful as it already was to watch :(
i&#39;ll give some cred to JT for surprising me with the acting
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitainteresting concept, terrible execution.... imo
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called Time Out.

YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaPoor people: Hey, Justin! Your cheating with time!
Justin: U Jelly?
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitahim and his mom on alpha dog lolss
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this supposed to be science fiction? This is reality. The poor are dying already young and the rich late. The problem with this is, that the rich can only exist with the poor :)
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitahow come justin timberlake end up to be a hero
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitathaats a copy of the game the world end with you!!!!!!!!
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaCan’t wait to see the chemistry between Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake. I’m really excited to see Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman or Nicole Kidman and Cam Gigandet in Trespass. Has anyone else seen the trailer for Trespass? bitly .com/qN22Cm
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitahow many times did they say time in the trailer for &quot;in time&quot;??
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is portraying the elite which are the ILLUMINATI and their NEW WORLD ORDER plans to condition us the SHEEPLE to accept and surrender our will to them. And their dream to mix human and robots to become super human- like gods.
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaRepent, Harlequin!

YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaSweet Concept, hot ladies 
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cool movie!
YRSBiTF3wNwdelimeterByIshitadeadman wonderland concept lol

kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI thought this was Independence Day 2
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitalooking fucking good!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaIs this the older brother from Jurassic World??
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaAnother divergent movie
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaIM SO FREAKING EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE OMFG
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitajust lol.  but chloe rules.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaTeam Ben Parrish wohooo
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaAMAZING! I can&#39;t wait for the film!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaWow, great movie in the beginning of 2016, can&#39;t wait
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m impressed.<br>Just hope the movie meets up to the trailers expectation.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI will stop the fifth wave......
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaMight be one of the best movie yet
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaмда
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOh look, another grrrl power movie. No, thanks.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaGreat, more illegal immigrant propaganda, THEY&#39;RE PEOPLE TOO!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaNICK ROBINSON IS BECOMING MORE KNOWN IM NOT SURE IF I SHOULD BE HAPPY OR SAD
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitahopefully this will have more movies
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitalol another movie were the heroes look 12.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaDamn, I will start to read the book tomorrow :)
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitanoveske!!!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaAt this point human vs alien movies are no longer Science Fiction but just the genre of Fantasy. <br>We can sum up that we are the most intelligent life in this solar system. <br>What does that mean? <br>It means extraterrestrials would have to have the ability to travel star systems. <br>This requires technology that manipulates time. <br>Technology that can gather up to date information on planets light years away. <br><br>Aliens that travel between stars don&#39;t have to fight us. They exterminate us all by pressing a button while at home before they get here. We cannot formulate a plan against them because they control time and know what we do before we do it.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this the follow up to district 9
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited. This movie looks so good. ❤
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitathe alien ship looks like district 9
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitahere for Nick &amp; Chloe
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaSNATCHED
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI READ THE BOOK FOR THIS IM SO PUMPPPPPEEDDD!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaHope this movie lives up to the book
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaAwesome, can&#39;t wait to see this movie!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaSomething about the title and dialogue of this trailer reminds me of Alvin Toffler and his books, of which the books &quot;Powershift&quot; and &quot;The Third Wave&quot; are two of my all time favorites. Carlos Slim has stated that he considers Alvin Toffler&#39;s books to be one of the biggest influences on his investment strategies, and I would agree that they are well worth reading.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI bet this is better then the walking dead xD
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaMe encantan Hacha y Ben, me encantaaaaaaaaaan
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitathis movie slays everyone&#39;s ass
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaShe is getting better looking by the day!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaIt sounded appealing until they were among us... it had potential.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaHuh....another body snatchers movie from the sound of it, but it still looks pretty good ^^
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI LOVED the book, it has SO many twists that it&#39;s AMAZING. <br>I also love that the movie seems to follow the book, not like The Maze Runner for example. <br>I hope the movie succeeds...
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitai cant wait to see this movie the 5th wave here i come
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t kiss that guy!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaIf this was to happen I would love to be in a coma and 80 years old. Lmfaoo like I don&#39;t have time for this 😂😂
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThis looks so weak. There is nothing original about this story
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M FREAKING OUT... OMG <br>The fifth wave is the best book I&#39;ve ever read, and the movie will be awesome.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaWASNT READY FOR THIS BYE
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshita❤️❤️❤️Omg it&#39;s Chloe is was on &quot;We Got Married&quot; a Korean show...she showed up as a guess that Eric Nam invited...love her so much...💖💖💖
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitait&#39;s gonna be so great!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaTeam Evan here!!!!! I can&#39;t wait to watch this movie, you all should read the books they&#39;re great!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is amazing !! I can´t wait &lt;3
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitammmm hmmph
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshita😱👏👏
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThe visual effects are medium, more for good than for bad, I&#39;m realling liking it, i know it will be good. Go read the book if you think this is bad.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOMG all is perfect, I love The 5th Wave
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaChloe is great.... but the special effects.....meh. as much money as these movie companies have, they sure are stingy with it. MURICA!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SO READY FOR THIS BITCH. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT I THOUGHT I WAS NOT GONNA LIKR CHLOE BUT HOLY SHIT WAS I WRONG
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI had goosebumps the whole time, its soooo good!! Much better than the first one.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaAs much as I love Chloe and her voice, I feel like if there wasn&#39;t a voice-over while they were showing the first four waves then it would&#39;ve been more intense and wouldn&#39;t feel so YA-ish :/
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the same ship from District 13.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaBtw; this Alien invasion plan actually comes off more like a Biblical Armageddon rather than an Invasion.<br>Also; Disease? Usually Diseases are how we beat the Aliens; now they&#39;re using Diseases on US? And how does it work? Are they Earth diseases, or are they diseases the Aliens brought with them? I&#39;m asking here, because I&#39;m almost positive the movie isn&#39;t going to answer anything.<br><br>Also, this trailer basically went from Independence Day 2, to the Hunger Games/Divergent YA Series that is way too popular right now.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaYes because teenagers who see a plane about to crash just a few hundred feet from their school would be dumb enough to stand and stare at it instead of ducking for cover...
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOMG!!!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaBelieve in Nick Robinson. He&#39;s a good actor! please see &quot;the kings of summer&quot; and then judge!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshita&quot;Fasten your seat belts because I&#39;m gonna 9/11 this bitch&quot;
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait this is going to be amazing 😁😭
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait this is going to be amazing 😁😭

kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOMG!! <b>o</b>
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaTHIS IS AMAZINNGGG!!!!<br>I LOVE YOU, ZOMBIIIEEE😭😭😭💚💚
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaDarkness. Destruction. Infection. Invasion. The 5th Wave is coming. Follow us for updates and tell us what you thought of the trailer! <a href="https://instagram.com/5thwavemovie">https://instagram.com/5thwavemovie</a>
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI read the books. Ben was supposed to be buff. Not some skinny ass kid from Jurassic World who can&#39;t act. Cassie is good casting though. Chloe deserves better.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this! Chloe is so talented. So is Nick Robinson. Looks AMAZING. and comes out around my birthday too:) How exciting!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI seen movie like this 100 times fuck sake Hollywood get some original ideas
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaFUCK YES SO EXCITED!!! And might I saw Nick is looking very hot
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaSO EXCITED FOR MY BOYFRIEND EVAN WALKER.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI have one word. DAAAYYYUUMMMM
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaPraying this turns out to be good. I hope it&#39;s good. 😵 Chloe &lt;3. Alex &lt;3
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaGoodbay Hunger Games!!! ✌️
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThis as a whole is better than the first trailer. Well excluding the beginning of the first trailer. This trailer did have things in it that annoyed me. I hated the voice over and it made me cringe. That being said, I&#39;m still iffy on this movie. I don&#39;t like the relationship between the girl and the blue eyed guy. It seems forced. Also, everyone but Chloe seems not to get dirty whatsoever.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaALMOST JUST LIKE THE BOOK!!!!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitai am in love with Nick Robinson<br>love him here and love him in Jurassic world
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaNICK follow me on Instagram: obrienxrobinson
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThis looks way to boring, I&#39;d like an alien movie that can be both creative and dark. I&#39;d also like a movie were we lose.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaMuch better than the first trailer I saw. Still nervous for this movie, though.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think the special effects are bad but I don&#39;t think that it is great, I could be better, I still like it.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaThat plane scene was hilarious.
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaI only clicked on this because Chloe Grace Moretz was in it
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaResult=20% rotten tomatoes
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaeeeee..... <br><br><br>no
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaHELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitathere were better effects in fucking the day aftre tomorrow...FUCKING 2004!!!
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOMG! 😱😱😱😱😱👽❤️😍
kmxLybfGNC4delimeterByIshitaOMG ! :D
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaNana&#39;s been acting a bit strange. &quot;Would you get inside the oven to clean it?&quot;, <b>Gets inside the oven</b>. Doh.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI cannot believe people are stupid enough to keep giving this guy money....
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaJust clean it
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThe whole theater laughed like REALLY hard on &quot;I was just cleaning it&quot;.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaNow I don&#39;t have to go to watch that film in the cinema; beacause i have just seen the full trailer here. Thanks... Fuck
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshita&quot;From the Acclaimed DIrector of The Happening, Lady in the Water, The Last Airbender and After Earth&quot;
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaMD看开头我以为是温馨家庭故事看到后面好可拍！！！！
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThe tagline should be: &quot;What&#39;s the major twist this time?&quot;.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWhat he did to The Last Airbender is inexcusable.<br>Honestly this looks like crap. Case closed.<br>It&#39;ll be a miracle this get&#39;s anywhere near 30 on RT, oops.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshital laughed out loud once and chuckled at least twice while watching
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaMust have been a terrible ,horrible, no good very bad night.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThere are couple of things I always keep hoping for. M. N. Shyamalan great movie return is one of them.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaSo excited for this movie, I almost had to turn the trailer off for giving away too much. I think it definitely looks creepy, but I didn&#39;t see much of the comedic side until the last line. Hopefully it comes through in the movie.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI heard that this movie was actually scary from friends who saw the trailer in theaters but after watching it looks laughable. The idea behind this movie is actually pretty great but I think it should be another director.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, just wish they didn&#39;t show so much in the trailer. I feel like all the scenes in the trailer were the climaxes but we&#39;ll see
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaFunny how no one has seen this movie but yet so much bad criticism by watching the trailer. Might be a good movie. I still have faith in M. Night 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaM. Night Shyamalan........   sigh.  This will probably turn into another Devil or happening with funny scenes like the killer trees or toast falling butter side down, and this will be a bunch of unintentional old people jokes.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=2m16s">2:16</a> so that&#39;s how the Nazis did it
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLooks ridiculously similar to The taking of Deborah Morgan except terrible
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Mom please hurry, I kicked Nana&#39;s scary ass down a flight of stairs. She has fallen and is not getting up&quot; 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaM night shamalongadingdong trying to be popular again. He didnt even put his name on the last movie he.made &quot;after earth&quot; because he was to scared. Lol. What the twist going to be this time?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI hope the twist is that the grandparents are actually just strict... and nothing awful happens... and they aren&#39;t possessed. <br>come on m. night... we need one more good movie out of ya! (at least) please help this not be awful!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWE DON&#39;T NEED ANY MORE FOUND FOOTAGE STYLE MOVIES
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaPG-13 guys... PG-13...
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaShitty ass grandparents to invite their grandkids to stay with them knowing grandma is fkin possessed.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWhen she was scratching the door I was like fuck no 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWelcome back M. Night... oh wait.. we haven&#39;t seen the ending. Never mind.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshita<b>puts gun to mouth</b> &quot;just cleaning it.&quot; <br><b>looks at kid suspiciously</b> &quot;would you mind getting inside the oven to clean it&quot; wtf? I&#39;m so done 😂<br>
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the plants trying to kill us again. Damn plants.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaBoooo boooo M Night booooo u suck!!!! Stop making movies boooo boooo 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t read all the comments here, so excuse me if I&#39;m repeating the same sentiment as other viewers... I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;m the only one here wondering why these kids are having trouble convincing their mother that something is wrong with grandma... They have a camera, Skype (or something like it), which means they have the internet. Why the hell don&#39;t they just send their mother a video of their grandma scratching at the door and be done with the whole thing? Unless that&#39;s the big twist, that the mother knows grandma is messed up and sent the kids there as some sort of sacrifice or something... Either way M. Night Shyamalan lost my interest in about 2 and a half minutes.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaNo one ever listens to children.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaAye
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWhy is he still allowed to make movies?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaOnce it showed that it&#39;s an M.Night Shyamalan movie,the audience groaned with disgust and disappointment. 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLook, stop with the &quot;I need to film this because of reasons&quot; nonsense.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitai dont get why people are hating already, this actually reminds me of the Goosebumps books i read as a kid, it could be fun.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaTake away the cliched, over-the-top sound effects, and you&#39;re left with a  lame home movie.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI firmly believe in M. Night.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot; were such strong films, I could never 100% give up on him as a filmmaker.  (And sorry, but I think anyone who has given up 100% is too jaded)  Even if this is another failure, I have to...  no, I NEED to believe that M. Night has at least one or two more good films in him.  So I will most definitely check this one out!  Yes, &quot;The Happening&quot;, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; and &quot;After Earth&quot; sucked like there is no tomorrow...  but this is the same guy who gave us those classic earlier films...  He HAS to have at least once more masterpiece in him.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaDENIED SIT DOWN!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaOkay the one thing M. Night had going for him was purposeful setups. And he decided to shoot this like a found footage film, WHY.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitadid this really have to be found footage?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaOh another movie from him..... Here the shocker for you guys. Grandparents play prank on their grandchildren at end of the movie. You&#39;re welcome.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI wonder why they didn&#39;t mention Lady in the water, The Happening, The Last Airbender or After Earth in that list <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a>?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a darker and more adult episode of &quot;Goosebumps&quot;.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer showed WAY to much..should have just ended at her scratching the door.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI heard this is supposed to be a &quot;horror comedy&quot;. Looks...interesting. Yeah, it looks corny. But I heard that it&#39;s supposed to be a corny horror comedy. I still have some faith in Shyamalan since he&#39;s a fellow Pennsylvanian like me, and plus his old stuff was excellent. He has great ideas...but lately they just haven&#39;t been portrayed well on screen. Like... AT ALL. Last Airbender and After Earth... <b>shudders</b> But this one seems quirky. I&#39;ll check it out.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaScary old people?  Looks pretty boring.  And the twist?  Hmmmm. They are at the wrong house?  The grandparents are aliens?  The parents feed their kids to the grandparents?  Bedtime is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=9m30s">9:30</a> because the grandparents are bootleg Gremlins that change well before midnight?  The movie is actually good and M. Night had nothing to do with it?  The trees are making the grandparents go crazy?  Granda is the witch from Hansel and Gretel?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThere was a time when I thought M Night Shyamalan was a remarkable filmmaker. I haven&#39;t felt that way in 13 years. Doesn&#39;t seem like I&#39;ll be changing my mind soon.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaIf the toast is jelly side up it means your going to grandma&#39;s house, SHAMALAN LOGIC.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitawow. can it get any dumber
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaA remake of Hansel and Gretel.....REALLY???!!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaIf they&#39;re all actually dead at the end, I&#39;m going ape shit
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaFound footage?! M. Night Shamalama Ding-Dong?! WHAT COULD GO WRONG. <br><br>Seriously, fuck this bullshit. 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaAlas, the true horror comes from who&#39;s directing it.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaMark your calenders! The Visit comes out September 11th! Since when does another bad happen on that date, right?!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWorse M Night movie?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQnRjkuvaY&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a><br>I&#39;m sorry, but ALL of these SUPPOSED scary moments had me roaring with laughter.<br>Shyamalan isn&#39;t even trying to HIDE how unintentionally hilarious this dialogue is!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the taking of Deborah Logan all over again...
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaBallsy move putting Shyamalan&#39;s name in big bold text in the trailer.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI bet the twist is those are not the moms parents!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitathis aint even scary since ive been in an a real exorcism
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThis has a Hansel &amp; Gretel vibe. 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaGuys this looks so scary! I mean he scared the shit out of me with plants and now it looks like he&#39;s done it again! I&#39;ll never look at ovens the same again 
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaPlot Twist, Nana and Popop have dementia.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care who the director is. Even if it&#39;s Michael Bay, M. Night, or any other directors that have a poor reputation, I like to keep an open mind. Especially if a movie looks original and appealing. And, boy, do I love twists. But M. Night is good at horror films such as Sixth Sense and Signs. Yes, the Happening was terrible, but every Steven Spielberg has its Indiana Jones 4, and came back with an award winning Lincoln. So, even though this is M. Night, and it&#39;s a found footage film, I&#39;m keeping an open mind simply because it&#39;s appealing and original.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaFrom the writer and director of:<br>The Happening<br>After Earth<br>Avatar: The Last Airbender <br><br>Yeh, no. I aint biting. How the might have fallen.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaProduced by huge film producers but looks cheap? Trailer shows too much.. And M. Night, so it could be either very good, or terribly bad.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaFunny.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaI wonder what the twist in this movie will be?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitai miss M. Night Shyamalan movies.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s looks like &#39;the taking of deborah longan&#39; but what made this movie seems different is, both of their grandparent are psycho~ I&#39;M SO GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!! UHUHU
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaM Night used to be awesome but this looks like another stinker.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaJust what M. Night Shyamalan needs...a shaky cam.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of THE HAPPENING AND THE LAST AIRBENDER
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitalooks like the taking of deborah logan
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWAIT! M. Night Shyamalan ..................Say No More. I&#39;m definitely not seeing this snore fest. These days M. Night Shyamalan is pure poison and a big joke.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaKnowing it is going to be another bad horror/thriller flick. I&#39;m going to go ahead and watch it anyway. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, I get surprised.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome! For all you haters, I would quit following the herd off of a cliff. Most of you were probably embryos or ovums when his good stuff came out.  I bet this one will be his comeback.......
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitakick these old people in the legs... wtf they gonna do?
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaGetting inside the oven to clean it....what kind of sick $hit is that???
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThe poster looked promising. Alas, the film itself does not.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitanope nope nope nope<br>can you hear that its the sound of my nopes<br>no pE
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaOnce again it seems like they want to show 90% of the movie and plot in the trailer.  This tends to move me away from seeing a movie, not towards it.
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaThe guy that directed The Last Airbender, and the one guy that produces EVERY FUCKING HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE?! Welp, we failed men.﻿
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get your hopes up people, for one it&#39;s another found footage film and it&#39;s directed by the same guy who directed The Last Airbender, After Earth, Signs, Lady in the Water, and THE HAPPENING!! all of which are horrible movies
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaM Night, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!!!
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaWTF
YfQnRjkuvaYdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA Would you mind getting inside the oven to clean it? Best line. Also pretty sure it&#39;s one of those aliens took over their bodies type of stories, or something like that. Can&#39;t be any worse than After Earth, and it does look pretty decent, but it could of just been another Paranormal Activity squeal.

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaToo much romance in it for me xd
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaFirst one was the best ever.. All the others are so cheesy reminds me of high school musical , they should stop making more . I love this one though !
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathis was the best out of all step ups. I feel like it&#39;s more serious than the other and the music is better even though I like all the movies
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaThe first one was the worst:(
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaMost def   first one  is the best
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaThe first one will always be the best
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaWhen you realize that they also got married in real life... &lt;3
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaAll the other Step Up movies are trash compared to this
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaIt would be the best of the franchise. But the fact that a young kid gets killed in it fucks the movie up :( it&#39;s made for all age groups n they put that in? That is seriously fucked up :(
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitafeels like i just watched the whole film. 
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaWorth watching this moive?
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitai can where watch this movie ?
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitame- look mum this guy is married in real with her
mum-ohh .. she married to a beautiful boy then .. ;o but I like more Amanda Seyfried=)
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaits just the original, the best!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathe best one!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitame too! lolz!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaLOVE IT! I have the movie

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitano moose?

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaOf course it is the best :)
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaagee
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaI think the fourth one was the best but I love Channing I had no idea he was in this movie lol I first saw him in she&#39;s the man

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaIs the 3rd one any good ? and is channing in the 3rd?

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitanice trailer but its a bit of a spoiler
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita1st and 2 always my fav(:
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaFirst one wuz always the best
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaChannnnning &lt;3
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathe others are ok i guess but they focus on the dancing TOO MUCH. the thing i love about this movie is that it has a raw, authentic story to it with a real and truly genuine love story that uses dance as an element rather than the central focus. 
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitajust finished watching this on abc family! :D
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitano!!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaAhh memories from this movie(:
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaahhh the first masterpiece that build them all &lt;3
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaHow many times this bitch gonna dance already
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaHoly shit! Channing Tatum is so f*cking hot!!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaNo moose is not in this movie
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaLike if you wish Channing Tatum was in every step up movie !!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitai think they should make another step up movie with them together or at least with channing tatum
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaIs moose in this one i forgot
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitacrap movie she still so stupid
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitawow nice
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitalove some channing tatum!!!!!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaDid Jenna and Channing get married before or after this movie was made? I wouldn&#39;t blame him though. She was smoking hot in &quot;Take the lead&quot;
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaI remember when Jenna and Channing weren&#39;t married.......it was great. :(
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathe one that started it all...
though best one of all of them!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaChanging Tatum site reason why I watching this -3 can&#39;t believe they both ended up marrying each other
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitachanning tatum &lt;3
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitawow there making the 4th one now but the 1st one is still the best in my opinion 
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathe first step up, was the best one out of all of them!
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaIs that the original trailer or it&#39;s kind of a joke?
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitahe looked so young
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita@Pouchy17 I recently watched the 3rd one. It was really good! I want to see the 2nd one now..
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita@xBilabong69x there is no 4
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita@LoLpAl02 you&#39;d be surprised.
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so cute that they are together in real life too :) They make a great couple
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the song of the minute 1:24
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita*good
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita@coltonvon2 I think i saw the part he was in! But like I want to see them together! Was it god?
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitahey do you know how i can download this movie?
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshita@LoLpAl02 Channing was in number 2
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitaI love this movie. I don&#39;t even want to see 2 or 3 because Channing or jenna won&#39;t be in there and it can&#39;t compare to the original. I know it.
ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitathe licence plate on the car that tylers dancing on says kfc

ZgnmCqA25-odelimeterByIshitasuper good movie~

s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaThe cat is a metaphor. It&#39;s a figment of his imagination and represents his girlfriend that died 7 years ago.
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaLooks like reddit made a movie

s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaкот симпатичный.
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaAnyone else thinks Sony sucks ?
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaAnd I thought that cat movie with Kevin Spacey looked lame.<br><br>I&#39;ll stick to Inside Llewyn Davis if I want to watch a movie about a down on his luck folk singer and a cat.
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaI swear if the cat dies at the end I&#39;m going to be mad
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaeu sou br,  li esse livro ano passado, to ansioso pro filme
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaBut cats are assholes. This has to be CGI.
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitaI swear if the cat dies at the end...
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshitai like the cat
s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshita8th

s13Fnj8LzD8delimeterByIshita1
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie as just saw it today and loved it.   The cast for Green Room is very strong and Sir Patrick Stewart is terrific.   Also loved Saulnier&#39;s Blue Ruin (a classic) and Murder Party (fun clever gory horror comedy movie).     So Saulnier&#39;s great track record continues with Murder Party, Blue Ruin and now Green Room.   Saulnier is such a great young writer and director that I can&#39;t wait for his next movie.      If you haven&#39;t seen Murder Party find it on VOD or Shudder, the horror service.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaJust saw it. Pretty amazing! Gonna need some sleeping pills to fall asleep.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOn a odd note if you do watch the movie they say a band by name ; ) and everyone clapped in the audience!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWent to a screening of this today and didn&#39;t have high hopes. Turns out I was very wrong and really enjoyed the movie.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like shit. sorry.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing.  It&#39;s a shame the trailer is overall shit, though.  Shit music especially.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait! Finally Gen Xer&#39;s making movies that speak to my youth! Oi!!!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaA movie with the same premise as SPIT on Vimeo
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaTrailer gave me chills
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the title of that song??
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitathis looks fucking retarded. hipster B movie at its finest.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI thought the bold head guy is Heisenberg
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaHey look! Red State!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaIf you reversed the roles of the people in this film, it would be the reality of Sweden or Germany today
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitacan someone help me out? I.m going to watch this movie with my dad. violence and gore are ok, but is there any sex or nudity scenes? would be really awkward for me to watch stuff like that with him. please don&#39;t judge! if anyone watched it and is willing to help I would appreciate it :)
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaprofessor x = neo nazi
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this yesterday at a free screening <br>Didnt know anything but the synopsis <br>It was really good<br>The dogs don&#39;t die or get harmed 🙂
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaDamn that bad moon rising gave me chills
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSo does this mean Jeremy Saulnier next movie is going to be titled &quot;Red Rum&quot;?<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know, if we&#39;re continuing the theme of colors (Blue, Green, Red) followed by alliterative words that sorta-kinda sound similar (Ruin, Room, Rum) in stories having to do with death.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaare skinheads going to metal concerts still a thing? that&#39;s one of the reasons why I don&#39;t fuck with metal
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaJust got back from an advanced screening. Movie was phenomenal, it&#39;s even better than it looks.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhite Supermacy <br>I hate to be that director who will remembered at trying to make white supremacy &quot;cool&quot; to watch.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaDidnt I hear this song on Teen Wolf?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD! THAT BEARD!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaBefore I watch this, I can&#39;t imagine Patrick Stewart as a white supremacist.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks lame. Stupid hipster thriller. Not exciting.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWait this isn&#39;t the George Lucas autobiography? hmmm nevermind
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitais this about a green room or a red band?? im confused
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitawow, Patrick Stewart reminded me so much of Bryan Cranston as Walter White
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSomeone gets caught in that nasty armbar in this trailer and in the other one someone locks up a rear naked? Sold
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaIf you haven&#39;t seen Blue Ruin yet you need to fucking remedy that RIGHT NOW!!! NETFLIX!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaas long as alia survives, I&#39;m all in!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaMacbeth has taken a dark turn ( for those who don&#39;t know, Patrick Stewart played Macbeth in the movie)
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaDoes Captain Picard gotta kill a bitch?!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know if that was an actual cover of Bad Moon Rising or just for the trailer? Because holy shit I want it.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitagonna be that guy ... anyone know the song in the last half?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCaptain, my Captain! NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaMy son told me about this movie yesterday and all I can say is...  WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT!  I am so sick of painting southerners as rebel flag waving, inbred, Satanic yahoos.  The majority of southerners are far more God-fearing that Yankees.  You stand a far better chance of being abducted by inbred Satanists if you hang around the blue-blood elite Skull and Bones politicians.  Hollywood tries to demonize the south because they fear us.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOk so forgive me in advanced. I know kno thing about this movie or its prequels? Can someone explain to me the synopsis?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaPretty sure a movie has to be good if it has Joe Cole, Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, and Patrick Stewart all together.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOh man I&#39;m exited about this. I loved Blue ruin. It had that &quot;drive &quot; vibe kinda which is why I liked it so much. Glad that the same actor is in this one.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitasong?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaDamn, looks fucking great!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song towards the end
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaIm still confused, what is this about exactly. it looks good
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCaptain Picard and young Chekov 👍👍
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSong?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitalooks good!  cant wait to see!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitawho did the cover of Bad Moon Rising?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie at TIFF, It&#39;s fucked but so amazing!!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT for this!!!!!!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaYou know I&#39;m not really one for violent movies. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re good I can just be a little squeamish. But I gotta say I REALLY want to see this one. It looks amazing!!!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song that&#39;s playing at the end?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if there&#39;s going to be a 3rd film and completing the spiritual trilogy that started with Blue Ruin...
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaMy response,<br>&quot;Hoooooooo-shit.&quot;
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCaptain Picard. I&#39;m very disappointed in you sir.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaToo scary! Why couldn&#39;t the band have witnessed just a shoplifting or something and then convinced the thief to turn himself in by playing music?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaBoth Minor Threat and Dead Kennedy&#39;s are anti-fascist bands!<br>Do your fucking homework! <br>Ever heard the phrase &quot;Nazi punks fuck off!&quot;? ITS FROM THE DEAD KENNEDY&#39;S.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaAmerican History X2:Skinheads United
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOh god, Professor X! What happened to you?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaA24 are always on top of the game
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitastar trek connection but not Roddenberry&#39;s ideal.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI lay awake at night desperately hoping that Jeremy Saulnier and Macon Blair don&#39;t succumb to the greedy money machine that is Hollywood, and they continue to make the films that they want to make and we want to see.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitatrue movie goers are watching this trailer rn
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI own a Confederate flag, guess I&#39;m a white nazi supremacist.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhen will i be able to see this?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail looked like Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaRed Redemption up next. The John Marston story.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaIs that the guy from Drunk History? The one that talks about Elvis and stuff?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaHeisenberg? anyone else getting that feeling from the great Stewart
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhat total shit
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaheisenberg
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCould someone help me figure out what song is playing?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitacan we get please Patrick Stewart in every movie now?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitagreen room and room connected maybe?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaHad to stop it mid trailer to preserve it. Looks amazing.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Let&#39;em bleed&quot;. Holy goodness. This looks amazing. Blue ruin was so nerve shatteringly suspenseful, this looks to deliver the same, if not! Harder punch.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YES
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI thought Blue Ruing was good directorial debut. I didn&#39;t love it as much as some other people did (although I do plan on rewatching it), but I still liked it. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how Saulnier evolves with experience and having bigger budgets and higher profile actors to work with. Plus It&#39;ll be interesting to see Patrick Stewart pull of a Southern accent.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else notice the irony of having White Supremacists as the villains but not a SINGLE PERSON OF COLOUR in the cast? Even the guy they kill is white.

Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Blue Ruin,&quot; &quot;Green Room,&quot; wonder if Saulnier will make a third movie with a color in the title? An unofficial trilogy of sorts?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaholy crap
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSo much bad ass! Oh, and thanks for showing us the ENTIRE FILM in the trailer. That helps.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d be very unhappy if I were named Imogen Poots.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaI really liked Panic Room
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is in the last part of the trailer?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Blue Ruin was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie this summer at a film festival. It was brutal and genius and yeah.. I would highly recommend it.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaTake notice world, best director in Hollywood in the next six or seven years right here. So stoked
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaWhat exactly was &quot;red band&quot; about this other than the salty language?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaIs this Johnny cash?
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaSweet. They used Peter of July Talk&#39;s cover of Bad Moon Rising. Great cover!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaOooooooo!  I like it!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Why April? My want for this movie has taken on a pained, pointed edge. It&#39;s starting to feel like NEED, guys. And it&#39;s only fucking February.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaGod, you just make my day with every new trailer you guys put out. This looks scary AF, A24.
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitaA24 is on a roll!
Q8XSARX3DQgdelimeterByIshitalooks like u better watch with someone that will hoid u scary
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&quot;He&#39;s still writing!&quot; - That&#39;s not how it works, that&#39;s not how any of this works..
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaBeing a fellow Aussie and all, I really wanna support my home grown talent but the Hemswoths can&#39;t act, especially Liam. I get they have the looks but seriously what it is with them landing all these roles?! First hacker I&#39;ve seen in good shape before, very believable lol!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHollywood is plague with Australians XD
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else crack up at the &quot;drop the big hammer&quot; line?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m calling it now... the guy they get help from, the actor for Thor... he&#39;s secretly going to be the main antagonist who ends up playing them all. <br><br>AGAIN, CALLING IT NOW!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaReal life watch dogs!!!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaName of the song : Antony and the Johnsons - Knocking on Heaven&#39;s door
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaYea, Chris Hemsworth really fits the part of a computer hacker.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they always have to turn cool concepts in to dumb action movies?  
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;The guy we&#39;re working will drop the big hammer and not thinkt wice about it.&#39;&#39; Lol.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaDROP THE BIG HAMMA
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWatch Up Mumbai 125 KM (3D) - Releasing on 17th October - You won&#39;t see high end 3D effects in any other Bollywood movie which are used in Mumbai 125 Km - 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitanice movie.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitai hope this is better than the game
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaMreh
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaBeen done before but, I really like Michael Mann, so i will give it a shot. 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaSo this is why we have a Thorita Now
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawow... can&#39;t wait for this one...
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaso this is why thor did not appear in the winter solider 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor is a Hacker :
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThe argument sounds kind of similar to Jeffery Deaver&#39;s <i>The Blue Nowhere</i>
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitause ur mjolnir problem solved
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaTitle CYBER ? previously
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitai think Loki Hiddleston can suit better with this main role...
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHemsworth totally does not look like a Hacker...my opinion...JGL would be great for this
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaLee Hom is the biggest closet homosexual alive
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaIf he got locked up for hacking, he probably has an aggressive attitude, being in prison for a long time, he would build up muscle from excessive exercise because there is nothing else to do, so to cast a muscly guy who beats up people in the film is not really an unrealistic choice.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitabad cast. still appears like standart hollywood bullsh
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor is the new Iron Man :O daiiim son !!! 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitadat propaganda
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHe just had to get casted out by Odin again, oh wait this is like timeout for him.<br>&quot;Let&#39;s take away his memories for the hell of it &quot;said Loki
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaDoesnt look bad but the cast seems a little odd.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHonestly Simon Pegg would have been a better choice than Thor...they did make up some ground as far as casting respect is concerned, with Tang Wei...jee-sus she&#39;s hot, I would tap that te...never mind. <br><br>Still looks shit, disappointed with Michael Mann; I expected much more.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaBoring...............................!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawow... can be nice:D
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll pass...
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Watchdogs">#Watchdogs</a> Hong Kong version
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaChoose, hammer or laptop dude.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor returned to Earth as an hacker!!! He&#39;s trying to learn the technology of Earth 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaChina seems to be getting into Hollywood more and more these days.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThe casting is our own fault really. If they had cast a dorky, scrawny, nerdball leading man then we&#39;d likely be seeing a romantic comedy instead of an action film. Offsetting the stereotyping began when Keanu Reeves(Matrix) and Hugh Jackman(Swordfish) started playing macho hacker roles. Other characters include Trinity(Matrix) and the Girl with the dragon tattoo, both of which are leather bound motorcycle riding bad asses that get off on complex coding. Probably the most accurate representation of what a hacker might really look like is Mathew Broderick(War Games),Wayne Knight(Jurassic Park),Kevin Smith(Die Hard 4.0) and Seth Green(The Italian Job), all of which have diet or esteem issues. Punching keys is not an exercise.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaSo a hacker that looks hot, has a sixpack, is good whit woman and knows how to use a gun? Nah im not buying it.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThe first half of the trailer was so good
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaa coder with that much muscle? I doubt
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitai want Chris Hemsworth to be the next oo7 james bond . he fit the hat,
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI came here cause of Chris Hemsworth .<br>This trailer make me disappointed
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawow, Wang Lee Hom!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting. Michael Mann using a high spec digital camera again <b>sigh</b>
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitalol Thor got drunk again<br>thinkin hes some hacker and ship lol
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaits the terminator..  sky net is watching.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaBoooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaChris Hemsworth playing a hacker...? Give me a break....
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&quot;The guy we&#39;re working with will drop the big hammer and not think twice about it&quot;<br><br>You know that&#39;s right
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitalooking exceptionally well.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23goonn">#goonn</a>  
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWhat a fucked up situation in industry when you identify movie by Chris Hemsworth rather than Micheal Mann.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaSeriously hackers dont look as good or as badass as Hemsworth
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI love it it looks awesome reminds me of fellow Australian Hugh jackman back  as hacker in sword fish
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaAnyone the songs at the beginning and end?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawhat da asian girl name.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitatbh he did not have a hacker face
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitanice trailer but next time upload Russian version, pls
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaFor those wondering about the song it&#39;s<br>Antony and the Johnsons - Knocking on Heaven&#39;s door
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitathor the hacker
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHacker tries to hack a hacker this looks dumb af
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaA beefy hacker that types with two fingers?<br><br>Sure, why not?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaNo coder would be caught dead using a membrane keyboard
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaa move with racial diversity? A rare gem indeed!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaswordfish: the Sequel<br>We can&#39;t afford Wolverine so here&#39;s Thor
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaBut I wanted a really sweaty nerd to be the main character....:(
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThis may be the first hacker movie to be made since the late 90s.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWhy not cast Donald Joseph Qualls instead?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaLove Michael Mann, but Chris is wayyy too hot to play a hacker... 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hopelessly silly. Has Michael Mann gone senile? Do they hack The Gibson?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawow hackers in movies have really evolved, now they look like models and know kung fu XD
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWhaaaaaat?.....CyberThor????.......mmmmm....Tom Hardy was the perfect cast on this one!!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&quot;blackhat&quot; how generic -___- why didn&#39;t they name the movie &quot;Kali&quot; or &quot;Backtrack&quot;
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor+Hacker= Thorker 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaReally Hollywood! Whats next? Jim Parson&#39;s the next James Bond villain.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor is still written all over his face 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&quot;... Will drop the big hammer&quot; <br>AAYEEEEEEEEE
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitawhat sound at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2g9qGbH_k&amp;t=1m49s">1:49</a>? 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitalol, this is what happens when popular media tries to be hip and make a movie about something in which they have 0 understanding
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaNuclear power systems aren&#39;t even connected to the internet, if this movie is saying that they hacked the computer systems at a plant, then it&#39;s already over.
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThe comment section is so dumb, Chris Hemsworth is a convicted hacker in this film! Listen to the trailer retards!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor reference @ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn2g9qGbH_k&amp;t=1m17s">1:17</a> &quot;The guy we&#39;re working will drop the big hammer...&quot;  
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI have a redhat
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaHe should have hacked godmode on :) 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good premise, but poor casting choice. Hemsworth playing a &quot;hacker&quot;, but then beating up on guys with tables? surrrrre
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThrow the stupid pistol away and use your damn hammer!
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaEverything is ripping off watch dogs
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaWANG LEEHOMMM OHMYGAHHHH 😍😍😍😍
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitatoo handsome to look like a hacker....
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t seem to hit the loooooow keeeey 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshita&quot;We need to cast a hacker.&quot;<br>&quot;I know how bout Thor!&quot;<br> I mean seriously how did he get the part in this movie?
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaI want to see that
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitathey should make a similar movie about a hacker who leaked real images of nude celebrities, oh yeh it will also be based on a true story 
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaGo to bed Thor
Qn2g9qGbH_kdelimeterByIshitaThor is a hacker...lol

iVAgTiBrrDAdelimeterByIshitaWow. 
iVAgTiBrrDAdelimeterByIshitaAmazing
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWhy do people waste their time and energy letting people know how much they hate something?  Must live a horrible fucking life to sit around and search things you dislike, just to announce to others that you dislike it.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer that doesn&#39;t show you the whole movie.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWhile watching this. I Farted!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis is a true story too. It&#39;s in the book 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI hope everyone that says ignorant shit about Americans and war looks at this and realizes its not always so black and white. All you hear is &quot;america kill X civilians&quot; and you think wow what terrible people. What you don&#39;t see is the choices they have to make, choices like this. Could you make that choice, and live with the repercussions? The word &quot;civilian&quot; is not the same when dealing with an enemy that uses children and women to do their dirty work, Its not like any type of war the world has seen in the past. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what it is, but ever since I was a little kid snipers have been like superheros to me. I was dead set on joining the military to become one until I hit 18 and realized what it actually takes, I could never make calls like this. I still look at snipers as superhuman and have the utmost respect for them. I will never be one though. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIf the film is half as intense as the book, we are in for a ride.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaha ha ha. müslümanlar çocukları terörist yapıyor öylemi? <br>ıraq<br>afganistan<br>syria<br>palestin<br>japan<br>vietnam terrörist??? kids terörist yessss. <br>OiiiiiiLLLLLLLLLLL
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitai guess Bradley Cooper is giving the Oscars....<br><b>puts on sunglasses</b><br>another shot
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI woud just shoot the kid in the leg...
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s more like a teaser 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIn the code of honor, you simply kill the enemy to survive. There is no discrimination based on gender, age or race in that situation.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaMedal of honor Preacher
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI smell an oscar nomination for Bradley Cooper
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitathing a little less a future vision?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshita&#39;Murica
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitathis movie has a bit like Battle L.A
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitawhat a load of bullshit
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitabekarchuda
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaHe almost shot Pauly Shore on his cell phone lol
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaone of the worst written books i&#39;ve ever read.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaFirst of all, movie looks awesome. Clint is still rocking as a director. Secondly, shoot the kid a warning shot an inch from his foot. If he moves again, take his leg off.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitahangover written all over it......
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshita
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaFinland still has the best sniper of all times. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4</a>
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaHow the hell is he supposed to see in his scope with out closing one eye? 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis dude, Chris Kyle, performed what I consider to be a necessary function.<br>I do wonder, however, at how different perspectives define a person. In any other walk of life, Kyle would be considered a mass murderer (which he is). However, because it is an act of war rather than an event happening near where we live, we dont think of him as that.<br>Before you start to flame, understand that I actually have no issue with Kyle, nor his kill count. Like I say, I feel he performed a necessary function.<br>I do think the distinction in how we perceive the act of killing based on the setting is an interesting study though.

99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaChristmas movie?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitashould called, &quot;Bringing Democracy, One Bullet at a Time. &#39;Murica. If you don&#39;t like it we have drones too.&quot; 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaMore war propaganda. Why do we even need to be in these other countries? More Americans die from bath-tub drownings than from terrorists, yet I don&#39;t see the U.S. dropping bombs on bath tub manufacturers. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitathis actually seems pretty good
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaojala llegue rápido a cine en Colombia cuando salga me la tengo que ver 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaAmerican propaganda 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitapure propaganda. Nobody knows how it really was. All we know this guy murdered over 200 people and is celebrated for it. It says a lot about america. Pretty sad if you ask me. He probably killed many innocent civilians. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaBoom! Go meet Allah!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaJust the kind of &#39;feel good&#39; Christmas movie the world need&#39;s in these troubled times.<br>But being an Eastwood/Cooper fan I&#39;ll be seeing it.<br>With bells on!

99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI bet that RPG is a water blottle for the thisty soldiers... That would be awful right?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaanyone else think that dude was Pauly Shore at first? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99k3u9ay1gs&amp;t=0m23s">0:23</a> 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThat moment, when you realize that you have read the book... I need to see this!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaNow that&#39;s how you make a fucking trailer, no spoilers, just a teaser, brilliant! Looking forward to this!!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not a military man, but shouldn&#39;t his spotter be also viewing the shot through binoculars? Then you would have 2 sets of eyes to confirm if it&#39;s a grenade or not. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s a kid gonna do with that, he forgot a launcher to fire the thing lol he can throw it but it proly won&#39;t go off and if it does he&#39;ll lose a limb. Or two.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI just love how the Social Justice Wackos are bashing this already
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaall this hate on american propaganda and shit. am i the only one who is a bit excited for this movie?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch this cos of brad cooper lol
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWell duh the most lethal in US history. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaChris Kyle = Trash. He made up more BS stories then the first 2 guys that wrote the bible!!!<br>LOL most lethal sniper in US history. Nigga please!!!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaTry to keep something in mind people, that perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten or simply don&#39;t appreciate as you post your comments and in some cases, detracting remarks...this entire exchange of dialog from first comment to last is a perfect example of &#39;Freedom of Speech&#39;.<br>That&#39;s merely a dream or a vague concept to some unfortunate souls in this world but, it is your RIGHT as an American citizen.  A GIFT that was earned FOR you; left for you; and continues to this day to be secured for you by men and women out there who go nameless for the most part.  If it isn&#39;t hard enough to endure wondering what might happen to them, many of them have families of their own at home who depend on them simply SURVIVING what they HAVE to do, adding to their burden.        <br>I am 48 years old.         I was born and raised in this country.        I have a wife and two children.                          I can say without hesitation that I have indeed enjoyed or have at the least had the opportunity to enjoy that which America offers.    <br>In short...I have taken,but....I have NEVER served.  I am regretful of that and I ashamed of that as well.  Furthermore, I find that that regret and shame grows little by little with each passing year of my life and quickened all the more each time I see headlines about whichever conflict our service men and women are now engaged in or committed to.  I CAN not, DO not want to imagine the stress and anxiety that any one of them must carry each and every moment of their existence while deployed so that we can enjoy the luxury....the entertainment of playing &#39;Monday Morning Quarterbacks&#39;.  Second guessing a man&#39;s decision without even being able to fathom the experience.<br><br>In retrospect, I suppose he could have simply shot the woman as soon as he saw the weapon.  He could have shot her immediately after she handed it to the boy and having done so perhaps the boy having witnessed this would have lost his nerve....perhaps....could have....should have.  Then again, I&#39;ve now had at least 20 mins or more to to consider my many many options and their possible outcomes.  Chris Kyle had MOMENTS ONLY to, quite literally. make a &#39;Life or Death&#39; decision for....How many people?<br><br>Honestly folks I was just flipping through movie trailers when I came upon this discussion.  I really don&#39;t know anything about Chris Kyle but it seems likely to me that by the time this &#39;Hypothetical&#39; was presented to HIM he had probably already seen &#39;first hand&#39; the horrific consequences of such a situation if it is permitted to play out to it&#39;s conceived ending.  This is an all too familiar fanatically extreme tactic of theirs and to try and understand it...is pointless.  As I said before, I have never served and I simply don&#39;t know if I would be able to pull the trigger, or at least without enough hesitation for it to have not been too late, but, I can not imagine that shooting a child, BELIEVED to be an enemy combatant, whether right or wrong, is even close to being the ugliest that WAR has to offer.  So, if you still insist on putting Chris Kyle and other American Service men and women on trial for such occurrences then I will offer my own opinion for you to consider...<br><br>It is not for me to say whether this was right or wrong, I will NOT judge this man or any like him in the same situation.  I simply don&#39;t feel that I&#39;ve earned that RIGHT.  I can, however, at least try to understand THIS man and empathize with HIS predicament, at least a little.  Conversely though, I am absolutely certain that if I were to live to be 98 or 198 for that matter, I will never... EVER...understand or be able to accept a Man or a Woman who willingly hands an explosive device to a small BOY, (an innocent), and directs him toward, what THEY know to be, his certain death as a tactical maneuver while they watch and observe from a strategic position of safety.  Playing on their enemy&#39;s Sense of Decency, (that THEY perceive as a weakness which will cause them to hesitate), they calculate, they hope, and even expect he&#39;ll survive just long enough and get just close enough to inflict the maximum amount of damage.      <br>I sincerely hope that this child did NOT fully understand the finality of what was about to happen to him because if he did...and he WAS  &#39;on board&#39; for it,...if he were actually that dedicated to this act we&#39;re discussing, owing to the way that he had been conditioned from birth...then none of us...will EVER...see a peaceful end to this conflict in our life time.    <br><br>War represents the ultimate degradation of humanity in my humble opinion but when the two opposing factions are equally set in their resolve and so far from understanding one another as even human beings, history has shown us that it is far too often unavoidable and even necessary and whether your doing it for your &quot;Country&quot; or for your &quot;God&quot;...what does it really matter?<br><br>My point is this,<br>You have a right to an opinion about this, no matter what that may be.  By all means, exercise it, I say.  However, that right was won for us all by those who preceded us with absolutely NO guarantee on it&#39;s longevity or even it&#39;s continued existence beyond their own.  They secured it for us...and then they left it to US to preserve for the next generation.  If you&#39;re not happy with the Government and their policies, foreign or domestic, then you NEED to speak out.  That&#39;s how it works.  That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work anyway.  Maintain a clear distinction though,....that&#39;s Politics not people.  The soldiers portrayed by actors in the film clips are people.  We don&#39;t know who the Boy was, but we also don&#39;t know the names of the group of soldiers Chris Kyle is covering.  Perhaps one of them was a relative of yours, your co worker&#39;s or neighbor&#39;s Son, a former classmate or friend of your Son or Daughter or even yours.  Don&#39;t post disrespectful comments about them.  Don&#39;t vilify them, or condemn them for their role in this mess.  They don&#39;t deserve that.  At 48 years of age I can tell you that I have been subjected to this my entire life.  As far back as I can remember I&#39;d heard the &quot;latest reports&quot; while my parents watched &#39;60 Minutes&#39; every Sunday night and the never ending on again off again &quot;Peace Talks&quot; throughout every decade since.  This is in the nature of Mankind and so it has been since the dawn of time.  These kids are just the latest participants.  Different players, little bit different Politics, but, in the end... the same old game played out to the same conclusion...nobody really wins.

99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThe kid was actually carrying a box of chocolates, your mind has just been blown.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t he just shoot a boy&#39;s foot? Why killing is the only alternative?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitashot on the feet, is it so complicated?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaShame that clint Eastwood is directing it but not playing in it.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis is just war propaganda to brainwash Americans into more Illegal wars!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitagood
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis is a fucking trailer, you get instant desire to watch it. Nowadays trailers are just long story short of a film.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIn this situation I would have shot the man with the cellphone to prevent all these coming situations from happening. One shot then you can move to the next mission.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitacampers!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaHow to loose your humanity...kill a kid or a innocent...<br>Sad war
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaGet over it. This is what we do. The millions sneaking into America don&#39;t seem to mind.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaMURICA
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaMADE IN MOROCCO
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaBefore you say anything , think about what you would do in his place...﻿
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty damn amazing, can&#39;t wait !!!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaPeople are surely sick of American war films by now, it&#39;s all we ever see. Do another nationality.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitawould you shoot a child who wants to save his country from  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23enemies">#enemies</a> ?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshita800,000 views but only 600 likes and 12 dislikes, JUST SAYING
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaCan anybody tell me which sniper rifle he used in this trailer ?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitavery tense trailer that keeps us on the edge of our seats. i can only imagine how the entire movie will look like. bradley cooper shows totally another side of his acting talent and i think he is gonna blow people away by his performance and i think he will get another oscar nomination if this movie is good and i think it will be because its directed by clint eastwood which is an additional plus but i suspect there will be controversy surrounding this movie.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIts make me a schivers.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaDamn, really want to watch this!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaYou know a better title would work rather than &quot;American Sniper&quot;.<br><br>WB be like: &quot;ho ho ho, have a bullet of democracy. Go out blow somebody&#39;s head, the Murican Democratic way. Coming to the stores near you.&quot;  ~.~)
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaY wouldn&#39;t she give the bomb to the boy inside... But they coulda just been helping the soldiers destoy taliban armament. But the dude on the cell was suspicious, I guess that&#39;s the suspense.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaok, that was pretty intense!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaTHIS HAD ME! I&#39;M ready for this good movie! R.I.P. Chris Kyle!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitayou seriously aren&#39;t going to tell me if he shoots the kid!!!!!!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaHoly fucking shit.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitalooks intense....
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis was my favorite book of all time so I am hyped 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaLol......... America seriously needs to lay off of the military thirst, and propaganda...<br><br>Lay off the guns America, lay off.. learn to live like normal people. It doesn&#39;t need to be in your every day lives. It&#39;s in your movies, your news, your politics, your homes, your schools. Stop.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaAww yee, I&#39;ve been craving a good war movie! Hopefully this won&#39;t disappoint..
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d take the shot.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaomg you made the movie!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Sniper was an amazing book. I hope the movie does justice to Chris Kyle, God rest his soul. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaDid she just pull that thing out her ass or what?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitawhy was this commercial first on the warner bros. UK youtube channel?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaOh dude that cliff hanger... WHAT DID HE DO OMG DO I REALLY NEED TICKETS TO FIND OUT?!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaDamn, tough call to make.
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaUm... Wow
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIf Clint Eastwood made it, gotta be good!!!!!!
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaCant wait to see this :D
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaIt is absolutely insane how much he looks like chris kyle
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWould you shoot the boy in that situation?
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaWow thats nuts :)
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Chris Kyle. You will always be remembered as an American icon and hero. 
99k3u9ay1gsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks beast
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitawhat an amazing True story!!! except that ron woodruff didnt become pals and business partners with a trans junkie named rayon, (and was she NOT the 2nd most important character in the whole movie???)  which means he never actually put his former buddy in a headlock to force him to shake rayons hand.  jennifer garners character was also a fictional creation, which makes sense, because she didnt come across as a realistic character, she seemed like jennifer garner in a doctor&#39;s coat....and ive got a  strong hunch that he did NOT even have a black female secretary for his business!  Not only that but can you imagine what the motel-manager and other residents would do if HE actually did have a huge long line of people outside of his apartment for most of the day?  And ive read at least one report that he wasnt even a raging homophobe in REAL life...
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaVery impressive, great review. Thought it would have died a lot sooner.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaFaucci was the main reason those people couldnt get treatment..don&#39;t you lefties forget that as you praise that lying greedy sicko!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitanever thought much of him as an actor. He just took his shirt of many times during every movie he was in. But in this one he blew me away. This is one hell of a movie.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaDr Fauci is the villain in this movie
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaFauci for prison 2023
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaJust so you know Anthony Fauci is the bad guy in this movie
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaMan Leto actually nailed it
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaI think of fauci first documentary
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful movie
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie doesn&#39;t make Dr. Fauci look good
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitajust watched the whole movie in this trailer
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaA worthy example of &quot;do not give up in the most difficult situation.&quot;
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaDR FAUCHI WAS BEHIND THIS. HE WILL BURN IN HELL
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaMan! I couldn&#39;t identify Jared Leto
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaJean-Marc Vallée, who directed this movie, has died a day before Jared Leto&#39;s 50th birthday! Heartbreaking!!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaWas thinking about watching this until i seen Jared leto was it &amp; even worse he&#39;s trans...yeah no thanks
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaHaving read Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s book on Anthony Fauci it is clear Fauci&#39;s desire to protect big pharma&#39;s interests in AZT killed many innocent people. Fauci blames Sen. Rand Paul for people making death threats against him. Having read RFK&#39;s book I think Fauci has only his self to blame.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThis film is making a come back. History repeating
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaCan’t wait to see the remake of this,<br>Some bloke that got fucked from the vaccine and ends up exposing the FDA, Fauci, and Big Pharma
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie had been about cancer, it wouldn&#39;t even have been nominated for an Oscar, much less won! Silver Lining Playbook and American Hustle were much more deserving!!!!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t want to get this movie pulled from YT, so I&#39;ll just say that the &quot;bad guy&quot; in it, the main dude who was striving to block AIDS patients from using cheap and effective treatments instead of his beloved AZT... his last name rhymes with &quot;ouchie&quot;.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaStill can&#39;t believe Leonardo DiCaprio was robbed. Probably because of the LGBTQ angle Oscars gave it to Matthew McConaughey. Otherwise no way in hell any actor can stand against Leo&#39;s performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. Don&#39;t @ me, I know it&#39;s true.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThis is a great movie. The fact that Fauci was keeping people sick on purpose is disgusting. He’s a murderer!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaDr Facci is the dr that’s portrayed
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaJust so you&#39;re all aware the bad guy in this movie is Anthony Fauci.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaSo they wanted to use cheap and effective drugs but &quot;Dr.&quot; Fauci denied them the meds, just like with covid 19! Arrest Fauci!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaRIP Jean-Marc.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaJean-Marc Vallee died today :(
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaRIP JM Vallée, 1963-2021. You were only getting started ! Bon voyage.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Jean. You were so gifted
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so good that it transformed my Grandfather&#39;s views on the LGBTQ community. Thank you Jean-Marc Vallee, RIP
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaRip Jean-marc Vallée,un grand réalisateur.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaAu revoir Jean Marc Vallée <br>1963 2021
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaRIP JEAN-MARC VALLEY, thanks alot for all thoses movies!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaRIP Ron Woodroof (February 3, 1950 – September 12, 1992), aged 42<br>And<br>RIP Jean-Marc Vallée (March 9, 1963 – December 25, 2021), aged 58<br>You both will always be remembered as legends.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaHeard the ‘bad’ guy in this movie based on true events is Anthony Fauci, the m0r0n who is currently blocking life-saving drugs for Convid
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaSo technically the bad guy in this film is Dr. Fauci
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaOf course NIAID under Fauci wouldn&#39;t allow available drugs to be used if they weren&#39;t new and cost $10,000 per year like AZT.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaActor is good but the movie sucks
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaFraudci
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought this movie came out in the 90s or early 2000s?
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitafauci is a fascist
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaHighly recommended flick. Don’t pass on this one.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaSuch a terrible trailer. This is a heavy, slow-burn drama - not the comedy this trailer makes it out to be. Easily one of the best movies of the 2010s
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t really like it but I&#39;m glad tried it out.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaI would be an amazing type caster... no seriously<br>I would have Mathew play John Wilkes Booth,<br>I would have shaved Trump and let him play Church hill<br>I would have Liam Neeson play Fidel Castro<br>I would have Benicio Del Torro play Che guevara <br>I Would have Donald Tusk Play Adolf Hilter.<br><br>I would have James Franco play James Dean.<br>I would have Noami Harris play Michael Jackson.<br>I would have Jimmy Carter play John F Kennedy.<br>I would have Jack Nickelson play Jack the Ripper.<br>Now you tell me somehow how these roles &quot;somehow&quot; all wouldn&#39;t work out...<br>You couldn&#39;t cause the would and you know it.........🙄👁🦴
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaCDC is at it again…
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThe unseen antagonist in this movie is dr.Tony Fauci  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDuaiYf8WDQ&amp;t=12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDuaiYf8WDQ&amp;t=12s</a><br>funny<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYfA3f9aEds">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYfA3f9aEds</a>
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant movie!!  and to think that monster Fauci  and his  false PCR testing to people  that thought they had HIV and  didn&#39;t and were prescribed the AZT drug which was making them sick!!!  and those that did have HIV were sick as dogs!  doing the same thing with covid, making people think they have it, and get jabbed and get sick from the poison!  WTF  is our life turning into!!  he needs to be removed!!!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaWhen the free market works better than your mixed economy bullshit.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaAnd the FDA is still the same. Replace AIDS with COVID and that is what you have today. A $3 pill is saving people but the FDA doesn&#39;t allow it because they have money to make.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshita1.09-1.20...American Style-That&#39;s how I Like it!!!🇺🇲✨♠️🇺🇲
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshita0.00-0.16🇺🇲✨💫☄️🌠🐂♥️♠️Real Easy...!!! That&#39;s coool...
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaDann tough Movie!!! I&#39;ve Seen it several times-He&#39;s a Cowboy....He&#39;s fighting His Thing🇺🇲♠️🖤Fuck HIV and Fuck Covid19!!! Move on Cowboys!!!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaVery boring movie. 0
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitato anyone that is HIV+ : you will live a long healthy life with modern medication, so many people are living healthy lives with one pill a day. You will be ok, you will find people that accept you and with more education to the public the stigma of HIV will be history one day. Be strong, dont let HIV ruin your life.
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a great movie
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t that guy from the series &quot;Lucifer?&quot;

KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaHistory is usually written by individuals, not by a flock of sheeps. My respect for M.McConaughey grew after this movie and not because of weight loss (which seems to have become sort of an Oscar warranty....)

KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitawhats the music starting at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDvPcBeOn8E&amp;t=1m56s">1:56</a> ?
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaGay
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitalife is tough :(
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaan amazing movie - the actors wow - 
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaHollywood need more of these type n style of movie...oscar well earned<br>
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant movie mathew and leto smashedddd it BUT i believe as good as the film was Leonardo deserved just the little bit more, both certainly deserve oscars
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaWatch a video that I made about Ron Woodroof&#39;s struggle with AIDS in my channel !!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThe movie wasn&#39;t as great as I was expecting.  Didn&#39;t really know anything about it and only watched it because of the Oscar wins.  Never seen Matthew McConaughey like this before and Jared Leto was totally unrecognizable in his role.  Both actors must have had to endure what looked like a severe and unhealthy physical transformation to play their roles.  They certainly deserved the Oscars. 
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitathis is a shit trailer. such a good movie though
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie! And hey Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner worked together before in &quot;The Womanizer&quot;!
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitawhats the music starting at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDvPcBeOn8E&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> ?
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitareminds me of Rust
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThe Trailer had too many plot spoilers
KDvPcBeOn8EdelimeterByIshitaThey say they can isolate HIV, and measure “viral loads” with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.  But why is it that the scientist who won a Nobel Prize for inventing the PCR test, Kary Mullis, says HIV does not cause AIDS?  Dr. Peter Duesberg was the first scientist to isolate the cancer gene.  He was also the first scientist to discover and map out the nature of the retrovirus.  He agrees that HIV does not cause AIDS. Also, Dr. Rodney Richards, one of the first scientists to create the first HIV antibody test, disagrees with the “HIV causes AIDS” hypothesis.  Even Luc Montagnier, who won a Nobel Prize in 2007 for supposedly discovering HIV, publicly announced at the 1990 AIDS conference that HIV did not, after all, kill T-cells and could not be the cause of AIDS. Montagnier also admitted on French TV, in 1997, that he never isolated the virus — and neither has anyone else. 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t u see him 1:13
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaif this Lincoln isn&#39;t killing vampires or zombies, i don&#39;t care
 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks wicked. But I dont know why everyone has such a hard on for Gordon Levit. He looks nothing like Bruce Willis which kinda ruined Looper for me and he looks nothing like Lewis so hopefully he is barely seen in this one.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:15
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaNeeds more vampires...
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWho wants to win a best actor oscar?  I do!  So I&#39;ll wait until next year to do a film.

--Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Denzel Washington, et al.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Day-Lewis goes hard in the paint.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaholy shit people... shut up about the vampires and trying to find JGL. You&#39;re not original or funny and if you pay attention you&#39;ll find him. Geez.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great and all...but when does the vampire hunting begin?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:14 taking his hat off.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaIs that Gus Chiggins or Daniel Day Lewis?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaforget about levitt, where the heck are the vampires???
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:14, Third from left.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaHear = hearing 

you&#39;re looking for: &quot;here&quot;
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaCool, man.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:14:)
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell? This is so historically inaccurate! They completely skipped over his vampire hunting years!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaidk if his voice really fits. but whatever 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert he gets shot
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:14 second to the right.

KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaat 1:14
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaNow HEAR is the movie I will see at midnight!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Lincoln dies.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitahahahaha
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThis film should get more money at the box office than Dark Knight Rises. I loved DKR, but this is something epic in every aspect imaginable.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitatestament to how an actor should disappear.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita
Ffuck yes
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThis is gunna be awesome
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:15
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita1:14
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaOh this looks amazing~! DDL looks just like Lincoln. And Joseph is rocking a mustache! :D
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitayou see him at 1:15 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitacertainly incredible but what about the racial discrimination still going on around the world! hope this will inspire many not to be racially violent anymore. 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita&quot;Amistad II&quot;
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitafilms are entertaining...
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: There are vampires and he kills them with his trusty axe
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s true, he did high a higher pitched voice than people would assume a man of his stature to have.  
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThe two movies I&#39;m most looking forward to right now are The Hobbit and Lincoln.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitawow
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaare u serious lol.. PAUSE at 1:15
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaAmerica Fuck Yeah!!!!!!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWithout any doubt as of yet, this is THE film to be beat during this year&#39;s award season!!! Day-Lewis seems set to break the record for Leading Actor Oscars
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaAround the 1:14 mark..
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita@valoth I agree that&#39;s a fine quote yes in deed.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaMom:would u go see this 
Me:yeah it look good Abraham *linkins Awsome and Steven speilberg made it so it has to be good golad as if
Mom:oh well that&#39;s..interesting
Me:hip it is
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert - He dies in the end.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaIf you think this movie looks boring, you&#39;re a simpleton fuck.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaya I agree with you its just this year there are tons of potential..the Master, Argo, the impossible, cloud atlas, django unchained, great gatsby, Hyde park on hudson, life of pi, moonrise kingdom, world war z... just sayin theres alot of competition this year. 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitailluminati
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWonder how it ends... Hmm...
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaLike if you think this movie is going to be amazing!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaYeah, keeping the voice to the reality is good
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaYES
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita&quot;Do we chose to be born or do we fit into the times we&#39;re born?&quot; That sir, is a damn good quote.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaIma go see this shyt
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar for best actor goes too Daniel Day Lewis. Spielberg could win his third best director oscar. Movie looks good.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know where we Americans got lost along the way with this incredible notion that Lincoln was some young political rebel aiming to end an injustice in the world. He married into a prominent slave-owning family, he for a very long time did not believe in the atrocity of slavery but the economical and political blow that the country would endure if it was spread throughout the United States. The whole emancipation thing was a political issue, not one of civil rights. 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWhat are your credentials? Are you really a historian, or are you trying to reprogram people the way you say others are? I research history, but I don&#39;t claim to be a historian. Nor do I attempt to try and make myself appear smart to anonymous people on the internet, as you seem to be doing with the comments you&#39;ve splashed all over YouTube. If these are your opinions, then you&#39;re entitled to them. But if you can&#39;t support them with confirmed facts, then it&#39;s not history. Don&#39;t reply. I&#39;m done.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a sad reason to watch films.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure this movie will be fantastic. I can&#39;t say enough good things about Daniel Day-Lewis, and Tommy Lee Jones is always a welcome addition. But this is a really bad trailer.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Day-Lewis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Tommy Lee Jones............................So where do I throw my money?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaEvery year has movies that are worthy, it&#39;s just nobody wants to see them or admit how good they are.  Like Lawless, nobody saw it but it was a damn good movie.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWell modern republicans don&#39;t bear any resemblance to their so-called fore-fathers
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaThe Republicans of then were not the same as they are today.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaYeah he&#39;s playing his son (grown up) if I remember correctly.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got to see this.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaWhat I´ve seen from Day-Lewis performances... He acts so much that it can look like he´s overacting but.. somehow, manages to draw the line in a place I call PERFECTION. I´m so excited to see what he didi with this character!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaLincoln&#39;s voice was never recorded because he died before the technology was available, but his voice has been described by his contemporaries and historians as being higher than you would assume by looking at him. Not like girlishly high, but not the baritone voice that he&#39;s been depicted as having by other actors playing him. Which doesn&#39;t surprise me. I know quite a few big and tall guys with sort of high speaking voices.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaU guys are are arguing on YouTube, about a movie that didn&#39;t even come out. Jesus Christ go and see it then judge it. And no one wants to hear u noodles talk about how they basing Lincolns presidency in the wrong way cause there not. They have top historians of Lincoln constantly working with everyone. Trust me u know, no more, then them
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaTo the confederacy: I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE! I drink it up.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Day Lewis completely transforms himself before taking on a role, I had actually thought he was going to sound like Daniel Plainview Lol
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDude, just stop. You&#39;re embarrassing yourself by revealing your lack of historical knowledge to the masses. The next time you feel the need to give the rest of us a history lesson, take your own advice and go to the library and actually read the books instead of just looking at them.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaGuys who are arguing...  It&#39;s just a trailer!  You&#39;re judging a movie you haven&#39;t even seen yet!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSo your telling me he didn&#39;t hunt vampires?

KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaLincoln is going to be THE GREATEST FILM EVER... 
ok, maybe not EVER, but it&#39;s going to be BRILLIANT!! 

and ENOUGH about that stupid vampire hunter movie!! DAMN... 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad this movie is staying true to his voice, most people picture him as having a deep masculine voice while in reality he had a voice on the higher end, it&#39;s said that when people first heard him they were shocked but after hearing what he had to say and realizing his genius they were past it :)
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait for this to come out, looks amazing. Also for those saying its bad, you dont know what a good movie is and for those who are wondering wheres the vampies, really?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita&quot;And the Academy Award for best Actor goes too... DANIEL DAY LEWIS!&quot;
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitamy jaw just dropped at his performance in A TRAILER 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitapretty sure i spotted joseph gordan levitt around the middle of the trailer! 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaoh i&#39;m definitely watching this on opening day!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitai wana see this shit
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaAm i the only person who believes Hollywood is making a comeback? There are a shit tone of movies coming out this year that are academy worthy. I cant wait to see them all
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI want to see it!!!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitathe boyfriend from &quot;Girls&quot; is in this... man this is a much watch now!!!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaLincoln should be black right?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshita•_•) You stabbed ten boxes of Corn Flakes?
( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ Well my friend, it looks like you&#39;re...
(⌐■_■) A cereal killer.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks stupid as hell
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Day Lewis can do no wrong, Phenomenal actor.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaBest part @1:15. Hell yeah.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI hope it has a happy ending.
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitamust see !!!!!!!!!!!!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaIts here. Looks great!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got chills watching this. Looks great!
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSo uh, where are the vampires, axe and hillarius blood and gore?
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitathis is one hell of a trailer
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaHe better be killing some vampires! lol 
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaSpielberg is best but he is not at his best since 2002
KJVuqYkI2jQdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! Spielberg is the best.

4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaCult film
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaA true masterpiece.  The best movie on racing for me.  Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl were awesome in their roles, actually much better than Tom Cruise and Michael Rooker in Days of Thunder.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaI see Thor and  Baron Zemo
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThats why there&#39;s Ron Howard, and then everyone else. Movie is superb.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaAs a movie on Formula 1 racing, this is a benchmark.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaoscar oscar oscar...<br>sad... none...😥
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaFinally Thor met Zemo
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaDecide to watch this because of Hans Zimmer
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaGimme a vettel vs hamilton
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie deserve oscar
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaBest movie
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated AF.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaWorld&#39;s most underrated movie
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of THE BEST movies ever...
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaWhat’s the trailer song? Which hans zimmer music?
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitathis movie has clearly been sponsored by a tobacco company. I find this kind of marketing unacceptable
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaHans zimmer has produced the greatest OST of all time. If this masterpiece doesn&#39;t give you goosebumps nothing will!<br><br>Edit: the score is called &quot;Lost But Won&quot;- Hans Zimmer
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaFuck it has Natalie Dormer in it &amp; she is naked 😍😍😍😍😍
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaJames Hunt looks like Thor
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaWhat I Took from this movie : A wise man Learns more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaFavourite ❤️❤️
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaEPIC MOVIE.<br>PERIOD
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaEasy one of the best films of 2013. So underrated..
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThree words: A Great Movie.<br>Almost accurate movie. The legend called Lauda deserved it.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaWow. Thor is an F1 driver? Chris made this film great
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best and engaging racing movie I have ever seen
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaive never seen this film before. i came here to see the trailer before i watch the film, it gets me more in the mood to watch films, it&#39;s an odd habit. after watching the trailer, whats the point in watching the film, it&#39;s told me everything about the film i need to know. so my real question know is, should i watch the film?<br>they seem to do this all the time know.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaHans Zimmer and Ron Howard work wonders !!!
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitathe untold story of zemo and thor in civil war goodbye
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaone of best movies ever.....
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaWhen Formula 1 was about heroes, not about how much fuel you have to save or save the engine.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so underated and very good- actually no. A great underated movie
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaDespite the movie is it self very good, photography is one of the best i ever seen, and it should have got an oscar for it... but the very best, is the portrait of nikki lauda, Daniel Brühl really really nailed it... even Nikki Lauda with is very own character praised him for the movie...
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie, and never get old!
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaImagine live action about Senna...
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThor vs Baron Zemo🤔
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThe most underrated movie ever. Simply awesome
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite films!
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaFreddy Krueger. The prequel
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThere should be movie like C.Ronaldo vs Messi
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie with big emphasis on the personal rivalry between the two drivers, certainly the best racing film.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite movie. Hugely underrated.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaAs a movie in general, it&#39;s good. As a racing movie it&#39;s easily one of the best ever made.<br> Ron Howard understood that the greatness in making a movie about racing was focusing on what drives the drivers, not how the drivers drive, and the rivalry of Lauda and Hunt is told well, without seeming too exaggerated to be reasonable.<br> Highly recommended movie, especially for those who have even a mild interest in motorsports.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThe racing scenes just don&#39;t sound right without Murray Walker commentating.
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaif you&#39;re looking for something to inspire you in life, look no further and watch this movie ....
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is underrated
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaMarvel characters Thor  &amp; Zemo in one movie .
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaOnly 157 Likes??? Fuck the world :I
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was a movie about dan wheldon when I saw the previews. I actually wish somebody would pay that guy tribute.

4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaNo known actor? Chris Hemsworth may be an unproven lead but he&#39;s the lead in Thor and was also in The Avengers. He&#39;s certainly a recognizable face. 
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else think that chris hemsworth looks a bit like Dan Wheldon in this?
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaI wondered why I had not heard one word about this movie before stumbling onto this trailer.  Than I watched it and realized that its because no one in the U.S. will see it.  No known actors and a topic no one in the state cares about.  
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaF1 version of the movie Days of Thunder. . 
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaLooks great but i just got the whole movie damn
4XA73ni9eVsdelimeterByIshitaThor driving? nice :)
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@supercj476 No I want to see this movie too.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThat look so good.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaDID JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE JUST FLICK ME OFF ON 2:06! WTF! OHHH NO HE DIDNT 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitawhy would they make a movie about of facebook???? but brenda song is in the movie!!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaam i the only one who remotely wants to see this movie or is it a nerd thing?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitathis is a joke right?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@silverstarinthesky some cover of the song creep by radiohead. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song in the trailer?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@2010CAS My sister goes to Harvard....
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWhy do they think this is a good idea? A movie about...Facebook...what the Christ. And wtf, Justin Timberlake? This is going to bomb hard.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitathe fuck is this bullshit? a movie on how facebook got created.........???????? next their probably gonna add in the beginning &quot; This is based on a true facebook story&quot; .__.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaooohhh so this is actually about the invention of facebook.  oh Because you know, I thought that it was going to be like maybe an innovative thriller about some bad shit going on about people or some massive worldwide scandal all relating to facebook or something.  REALLY???  A goddamn biopic about facebook!?!?!?  Shittttt this looks boring already.  Somebody ripping off someones idea?  Damn just watch Big Fat Liar.  It&#39;s the same shit!  omg. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita&quot;I need to get the attention of the clubs because their exclusive, and fun, and leed to a better life&quot;. Jesus fucking Christ! I am part of the most shallow generation of all time.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaGod damnit the choir version of Creep on this trailer is fucking amazing.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThis is truly a case where the trailer will probably be better then the movie lol 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWill see it if only to hear the new work from Reznor and Ross in the score :) 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaAfter seeing this trailer, I am wondering if movies are going to be made for Napster, Xanga, and Myspace now. LAME!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaAnd what pray tell makes you think that? Other than finding old friends and schoolmates, there is nothing special enough about Facebook that screams &quot;let&#39;s make a movie out of it,&quot; and I don&#39;t care who directed it.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThat was my thought exactly when I saw the trailer for it last night prior to watching Inception. This movie should have premiered on the internet like the Youtube documentary Butterflies did, not make a big nationwide release in theaters.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThink about how these college students are so successful, because you have your best ideas when your young. Einstein, Gates, The Beatles, Jobs and HP.  
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWhy did they ever think this would be a good idea for a movie?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pretty sure a lot of people are gonna have a new respect for facebook after watching this...
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita1:11 was not filmed at Harvard, but at my high school!!!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita1:30 BUNS
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaCreep is a great song probably perfect for this trailer and theme
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitacreep ..
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@2010CAS I take it you never even step a foot in Cambridge, Mass to make such an erroneous observation about the lack of hotties in Harvard.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThis movie will make Americans more artificial than ever. Facebook is bad and this isn&#39;t a true story. One reason, he wasn&#39;t a party guy in college.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Tenchi tumblr is going to be next 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaIs this the film with NIN doing the soundtrack?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@whymytie Same here, I hope this movie is as good or even better than Pirates of Silicon Valley :)
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThe song really gets to me
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita&quot;you don&#39;t make 500 million friends without making a few enemies&quot;
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitacrap
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@SuperRandom3333 Well YouTube&#39;s founding wasn&#39;t really as controversial as Facebook&#39;s.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Tdi7457 First of all, who&#39;s to say if its creation is interesting or not? Don&#39;t you dare speak for me or for other people. Second, how is it a miserable idea to cash in on it? Facebook didn&#39;t create this movie and they don&#39;t endorse it either. It puts their company under a negative light. Third, see number one.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@lilman99025 Thankss!! I&#39;m so learning this song! ; ) 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@ChangesOfTheWind67 The people who do it are the Scala and Kolacny Brothers and its creep like the other guy said
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@puffrooster  Thanks dude!! ^-^&#39;
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaCan someone tell me the name of the song ?? 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@MarciusWhithood In less capable hands, I think this would have been a direct-to-television release. It&#39;s directed by David Fincher, written by Aaron Sorkin, with music by Trent Reznor. Yes, the story seems a lot more trite, but I think the movie is going to surprise a lot of people. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@genshikenluffy He has only been in Zombieland... and Adventureland, The Education of Charlie Banks, The Squid and the Whale, Cursed, The Village, etc. He&#39;s been around a lot longer than people think. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Damag3R3port Jesse Eisenberg is playing Mark Zuckerberg. David Fincher is the director of &quot;The Social Network.&quot; 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita...I wander what this is rated...
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaam i the only one thats going to watch this movie because of that girl in the booty shorts??
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThis looks really stupid. Maybe I&#39;ll be surprised, though
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitathere are not this many hot girls at harvard....or any at all
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@perry570 Dude, you&#39;re mistaking Jesse Eisenberg for Aaron Johnson III. Jesse is the one in Zombieland. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@envey18 Andrew Garfield... the dude playing David Fincher&#39;s (Jesse Eisenberg) friend has just been cast as the new Peter Parker for the reboot of the Spider-man movie franchise. He was awesome in The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus (Heath Ledger&#39;s last movie).
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Damag3R3port is he acctualy? that would be sick he was killer in kick ass
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitawas that brenda song aka london tipton
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@gogostop92 yeah, I saw the same thing... I was &quot;Whoa, it is Brenda Song and she is not doing anything Disney related&quot;.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Flaitesexy 
That would be awesome. 
I hope this movie wins an Oscar
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaIt looks so lame, I just may have to go and see it.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitahey brenda song?

wazzzzz up ;)
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitai want a movie of youtube history lol
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaso....this movie is about a website?
i dont get it, but it apparently has justin timberlake and brenda song in it so ill be watching it.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThe soundtrack to the movie was officially produced by Trent Reznor.  Not surprised to hear a radiohead cover for the trailer.  Especially radiohead&#39;s first hit!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@ClassToGym  I didn&#39;t know you were his biggest fan.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@genshikenluffy og my bad i mistook him for that kid thats looks like him from superbad...but i still dont like this guy cuz he reminds me of him
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@ShadowTH555  He&#39;s only been in Zombieland.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWTF?  DAVID FINCHER directs this and he doesn&#39;t even earn himself a caption in the trailer?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaFacebook becomes popular. 

Then the worlds falls. 

What else is in the news? 

lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaThe only this this movie epitomizes is the downfall of human relations. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaWow... 
I didn&#39;t think facebook could work in movie form. Haha.
Anyone know the name of the song?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitadude i saw this trailler when i went to go see &quot;INCEPTION&quot; *best movie EVER by the way* but this movie looks like crap besides that fine ass asian chick in those few parts haha omg but i hate the main actor guy like hes in every movie now and im tired of it arg
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitajesse eisenberg is essentially a jewish michael cera
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@faraoseth Thank you 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@Damag3R3port huh??
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI think i&#39;ll tweet this.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@nileaotw Its because Facebook was made before Myspace.Nothing like Facebook had ever been made before.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaat 1:10 there is a dj with a laptop 
and the program he&#39;s using wasn&#39;t around in 2003 

lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@10wyz1  I can&#39;t understand what you want to say at all
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaLadies and gentlemen, Peter Parker aka Spider-man.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@MrOtay101 it kinda already has.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitauuuuuuuuuummmmmmmm??
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaomg its radiohead in chorus
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaFacebook does have an interesting background of how it started for all those who do not know the story, and with the cast and crew behind this movie, can be a good movie,
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitalooks interesting, Eisenburg is pretty good
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitainteresting...........
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitawhats next a twitter movie?
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitai think facebook is gonna go down in history
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.  To hell with you haters.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@TheUltimateEscapist Touche
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaAt best, this should have been a direct-to-dvd release, not a theatre release.  What&#39;s so special about it?  I mean, really...it&#39;s a movie based on the origins of Facebook.  C&#39;mon, Hollywood, you can do better than this!  

Also, I find this flick to be very reminscent of Pirates of Silicon Valley; though the story behind PoSV has much more relevance to us than fuckin&#39; Facebook.  Give me a break!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaLook stupid
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitathis movie....this movie... what has the world come to? is there a god? making this movie is definately a sign of the apocalypse... definately
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaif it has jesse eisenburg im in!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitainterestin
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaJustin Timberlake?? Seriously?!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshita@SmexyAsianGirls lol dam right it is. facebook copy myspace ;D
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaCREEEEEEP!
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI thought it was going to be thriller. But this looks interesting too.
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaLooks good
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI bet some of this was made up. XD
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitahmmmm...looks good
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe people still don&#39;t understand what this movie is about. All the comments on the trailers are like &quot;omg a facebook movie??? lulz thats so stupid!&quot; when they obviously haven&#39;t taken the time to actually look at the IMDb page or learn anything about what it&#39;s about. 

Personally, I think it looks like an awesome legal/thriller type movie, and Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher are both amazing, so it should be pretty good....
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI thought this was a joke...or sitcom....or parody....:\
Well cool now they&#39;re going to make a &quot;Youtube&quot; movie 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitai might actually go &amp; see this to see how all the madness got started with facebook. 
lB95KLmpLR4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused and interested. Good job! I look forward to it! :)
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaLooks good.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaA good exspensive test movie to see if they can pull off The Witcher as a movie in the future.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaAnd I didn&#39;t even have to pay a single penny to watch it, thanks for this :)
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitauuuuuoooooh jooooon snooooow
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaIt seems like a good movie althoug quite predictible. It reminds me of city of bones and constantine. 
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaMovies about hunting witches = the only time a guy can smack around women while looking cools doing it. I like it.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin Diesel is just gathering money to shoot the next Riddick
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaConstantine, is that you ?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaOh another great movie... Wait, what? Rose Leslie kissing Vin Diesel? Ewww...
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaIF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE FOR REAL!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaHit Like if you are gonna watch it because of Ygritte
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin &quot;Geralt&quot; Diesel from Rivia Triss &quot;Ygritte&quot; Merigold and Frodo
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaFrodi is killin it!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaAnother generic supernatural CGI flick. Meh. Boring.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaOh Elijah got some job.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYou know nothing Vin Disel
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaкакая-то хуйня
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaGeralt would do much better job
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaWho needs a gun when you have your entire body.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitai saw a bald scorpion from mortal kombat
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis better not be as bad as Babylon AD
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking cool.<br>Always nice to see fresh IP.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin Diesel look like him  the trailer look bad ass hope the movie is great one cant wait
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis looks dumb.<br><br>I&#39;m in.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshita&quot;You Know Nothing&quot;
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshita&quot;Jugs&quot; in the URL lol.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaLooks good, but story is totally jacked from the Witcher series.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaFucking Toretto, Frodo, Alfred and Ygritte in one movie.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m cautiously optimistic about this movie. Unfortunately the trailer is giving off a bit of an I, Frankenstein vibe. And that&#39;s never a good thing.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYgritte and Frodo? That can&#39;t be good! :D
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshita&#39;And so it begins&#39; - lol!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitawho else came here from jusreign?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never seen Vin Diesel with so much hair.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis actually looks really good. I will see it for sure.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaLoosen up everyone! Truly, this will be a feast of action and drama!!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaFreaking awesome, gorgeous Diesel... Definitely... Looking forward to October 23! Keep creating magic for us... We got your back! Lots of blessings and love have been sent your way! ❤👌👍👏
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitawhat rate is it!?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaWell, looks like witch burnings are around the corner.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaCrazy!<br>
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaa cross between Game of Thrones, Valiant&#39;s Eternal Warrior and Solomon Kane.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaWhy, Frodo, why?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaAt this point Vin Diesel might as well just be Vin Diesel in every movie. He has no range...but it works.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaso amazing
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaCool can wait till see this movie
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m hooked... Can&#39;t wait!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI hate how trailers show all the best parts of the movie lol.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaliked it, but better kept the Beard so He Doesn&#39;t look like Toreto but in a different movie.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaSend there Sam and Dean Winchesters!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaWith that hair at the beginning and the title witch hunter, vin diesel here strangely reminds me of Geralt of Rivia from the witcher.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitalooks like they are trying to make the concept of the witcher into a movie. without the witcher being in the movie. and too bad its vin diesel. but hey, ill give it a chance
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaSo Riddick, Ygritte and Frodo walk into a bar and Alfred asks them &quot;What&#39;ll it be, boys and girls?&quot;<br>Riddick says, &quot;One badass fantasy film, please.&quot;
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to watch this on Redbox.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaAlfred, Frodo, and Dominic Toretto in one movie!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis looks like Blade with witches
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaAdmit it guys....we&#39;re going to see this because of Ygritte.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYOU KNOW NOTHING, KAULDER. :3
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitais like a Witch Catcher???
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuG2JUgs_8&amp;t=2m02s">2:02</a> so Vin Diesel is Azor Ahai. Neat.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin: &quot;I heard fighting CGI is what sells?&quot;<br><br>The Rock:  &quot;Dude, you don&#39;t even have to really work out either.  They&#39;ll give you CGI muscles so you can CGI dick smash CGI monsters!&quot;<br><br>Vin: &quot;And people pay to see that shit?&quot;<br><br>The Rock: &quot;HAH, fuck yeah dude.&quot;<br><br>Vin:  &quot;...sweet.&quot;
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaCannot wait for this movie.  Straight out of Vin Diesel&#39;s D&amp;D playing days.  You know he&#39;ll have put a lot into this movie, as it&#39;s based on something he&#39;s passionate about.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin diesel, rose leslie,  Elijah wood,  FUCK YES!!!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitayo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsuG2JUgs_8&amp;t=2m09s">2:09</a> THE LAST OF US<br>ANYONE ??
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitalooks meh. I like vin diesel but well the guy acts exactly the same in all of his movies.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaGuess Diesel likes that red minj!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaygritte, frodo, and alfred in one movie... interesting...
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitavin diesel looks very odd with a beard
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaDear God, this looks like it could possibly be the worst movie ever made. I can&#39;t wait to never see it. And never hear about it. Ever again.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaObvious flop is obvious.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitacant wait
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI prefer his Adult work
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYep. I&#39;m gonna watch this.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaRiddick  on a witch Hunt ..... Ok I,m in :) 
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitayou know nothing vin diesel XD
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaNOPE.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaSo Jon Snow needs light bringer and Ygritte gave it to Dominic Turretto?!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaWould have been awesome if this was set in a medieval fantasy world. Well I guess you can&#39;t get everything in life <br><b>cries in a corner while playing witcher 3</b>
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaMichael Kane and Elijah Wood? I am impressed. 
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin is a total bad ass in every movie he&#39;s ever been in!!!!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaCamp as hell, but I&#39;m in.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaSo you have Toretto teaming up with Ygritte. OK!
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaGroot Origin Story?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis really got me more interested, well done.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaDiesel looks like Ragnar
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI wish they didn&#39;t show him kissing the girl other then that good trailer. I hope this does well so we can get a Justice League Dark movie 
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaElijah, my baby.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaEmma Watson + vin diesil in a movie = awesome
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitalooks good
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI like it.  Kinda reminds me of Constantine (the show and the movie) which to me, are both underrated.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYou know nothing Witch Hunter
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks incredible.  Why all the negative comments in the comments section?
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaI like the idea of it but there was nothing new there at all. Looks pretty meh unfortunately.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaDominic Torretto meet Alfred
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaVin Diesel the new chuck norris  h3h3h3h3h3h3h3h hhhhhhhh
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaLiking the looks of this! Roll on October.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaThis movie will flop more than my penis does over a hyperalloy endoskeleton.
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitalove it :)
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitalol only 200 views and 2 comments, its gonna flop
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaYay! I&#39;m second here ;) 
xsuG2JUgs_8delimeterByIshitaToretto has gone wild man...
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaHarry, stop using magic to bring people back to life.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaFill a movie with British actors and then don&#39;t give us a proper release date. I don&#39;t know when the hell Thanksgiving is.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI think this will either end up being pretty good, or really, really bad.  I like the cast and the Guy Ritchie &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; tone it&#39;s giving off, but there&#39;s the chance it could turn into a mindless mess.<br><br>It definitely has potential.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaestou na merda
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast but looks pretty bad cgi, nevertheless I think it looks like a diamond in the rough among other movies like this
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potters hair is so unbelievable.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaIs that James Moriarty ?
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitawill only see if above 60% on RT
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLove McAvoy&#39;s natural accent. He could read a phone book and it would sound cool.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaFrom the trailer it looks like they&#39;ve handed all the emotional torture Frankenstein endures in the novel to Daniel Radcliffe and the obsession to James McAvoy, who comes off as a English/Scottish Robert Downie Jr type
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitawow awesome cast ... i cant wait
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaProf Xavier + Harry Potter + Moriarty
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it a comedy?
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitalooks fun :) MORIARTY
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaMeh, unimpressed.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThank god Lily didn&#39;t marry Snape! Know what I mean??
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaMoriarty!!!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaFrankenstein is played... so played.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI still think penny dreadful is way better especially when it comes to victors story
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaharry its that you?
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshita&quot;Its FRONK-in-STEEN&quot;.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshita<b>internally screaming</b><br><b>externally screaming</b><br><b>eternally screaming</b>
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaHas a RDJ SHERLOCK HOLMES feel to it.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t igor supposed to be ugly and stupid
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaNot so enthusiastic about the movie.... But the cast is spectacular
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaArrrggghhh! Jim moriarty! Take my money now!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing that&#39;s good about the trailer is that Andrew Scott is in it...
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaMORIARTY!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitase ve muy bien
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitab. bkcvh

7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaAyeeee i saw moriarty from sherlock
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaSOOOO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! Looks like an amazing adventure, slightly horrific movie! Cannot wait until November 25th... Thanks James for the reminder XD James kinda reminds me in this of his character in The Ruling Class which is just brilliant! :D
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxZxY_Siyc&amp;t=0m51s">0:51</a> Did they just reference Young Frankenstein? Oh Fox you can have my money.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaIgor doesn&#39;t exist in the book yet again.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Radcliffe, James McAvoy and Andrew Scott... SIGN ME UP!!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitahmm, could this mean what I think it means??  That McAvoy is finally going to play a bald Professor X?  Oh, and look, another Frankenstein movie but this time all kid like.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaJames McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe in Victor Frankenstein <br>I can not stand more I want to see that movie
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of those Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr., even the font they used and the choice of music. I can&#39;t really tell what sort of theme tis movie is going for, but the cast is promising.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThe cast is what is going to make this film! so excited for it!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks like fun, actually.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitai screamed when i saw andrew scott rip
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaProfessor Moriarty, Harry Potter and Professor X in the same film!....I just had a Fangirl orgasm
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks rather interesting... i think i&#39;ll give it a go ..
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Scott ♥♥♥
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaWell. I like it. :)
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaJames McAvoy looks like VOLDEMORT!!!!!!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks really cool. But, Why the pirates of the caribbean score style?
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaWell this movie looks rather limp and lifeless. MORE LIGHTNING IGOR AND A BOTTLE OF VIAGRA!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks alot like a sherlock holmes movie
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaREVITALIZE SENT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaaWESOME
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaIgor Potter and The Ressurection of Franky
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaBrace yourself, comments about Professor X, Harry Potter, James Moriarty, and Mycroft Holmes are coming.<br>Like this one.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks Awesome!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaSeems like Moriarty really likes to deal with sociopaths
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaProfessor X feat.Harry potter  lol
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaCharles Xavier and Harry Potter this is going to be great
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaSimply Amazinggg! It&#39;s going to be a blockbuster hit for sureeee! The wait was worth it!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitatbh it looks more like a re animator reboot type thing...
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t they make the release date October 30th?? November is a little late IMO
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitatheres another trailer floating around. I like that one a lot better
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOSH<br>AWESOME!!! 
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaMoriarty baby! Andrew Scott is blowing up big time at the moment, so happy about that!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!! :D
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaAnd I just did an IMDB search; LOUISE BREALY???  WHERE CAN I BUT ADVANCE TICKETS????
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Scott? I don&#39;t need to see anymore. I&#39;m in. 
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t the right tone. It&#39;s Frankenstein, not Pirates of the Caribbean...
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaReally like that they&#39;re not making just another generic horror movie, they&#39;re kind of making a comedy horror adventure hybrid. With a great cast, and funny moments in the trailer, really looking foward to this
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaomgg can&#39;t wait!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaomgg can&#39;t wait!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait 😊
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaEh. This seems more like an action flick rather than a &quot;Modern&quot; retelling.. I would honestly want to see a Frankenstien movie that follows the original Mary Shelly &quot;novel.&quot; And have it more like a SciFi Drama.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitalooks GREAT, reminds me of the most recent Sherlock Holmes films
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT! THIS LOOKS GREAT!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast, interesting take... Kind of reminds me of how they Guy Ritchie approached Sherlock Holmes (gritty London while slightly humorous)
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this movie soon.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThe font&#39;s a bit weird..
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshita105th view &amp; 11th comment!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaIt looks amazing!!! I can barely breathe I am so exited!!!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI would move up the release date to October 30th but that is just me.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThis is fantastic! Can&#39;t wait to see the movie!!!!!!!!! I love how Daniel chooses roles!
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so amazing. Can&#39;t wait for this movie. Also Xavier, Harry Potter and Moriarty in one movie 😱😱😱
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitagood trailer
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping this would be a modern retelling. Looks good regardless.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitahaha love James McAvoy
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potter and the Days of Frankenstein Past
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks like van helsing reboot
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaJames ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitajames mcavoy look really tall compared to daniel radcliffe lol
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaWish it were longer. But, good job Fox. I hope this isn&#39;t another Fant4stic...
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaSo...this is the prequel to Young Frankenstein, right?
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitawow
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaThis cast is amazing! Can&#39;t wait to watch this.
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaLooks not that good but you can&#39;t help it but like these guys
7pxZxY_SiycdelimeterByIshitaFIRST
