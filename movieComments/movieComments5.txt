12zoi09mRoEdelimeterByIshitaI found this movie quite watchable, reminded me of the old Hitchcock films.

uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaMy only problem with the trailer is that they said it wasn‚Äôt our planet. If they said something like ‚Äúthe hunt has evolved‚Äù, ‚Äúthe hunt has changed‚Äù or ‚Äúthere‚Äôs new blood in the hunt‚Äù I think that would‚Äôve been better. Still loved the movie though
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita&quot;How do we kill them?&quot; &quot;However you can&quot;  üëçüëç
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe movie was far better than the 2018 crap.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis was actually a half decent effort to recreate intensive atmostphere of the legendary first movie. The first half of the movie is actually pretty good. Then it goes downhill. Mediorce but a masterpiece compared to awful &quot;The Predator&quot;.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThey should of kept  going with this.  Acting was great.  Plot was great.  Every thing about this was great. Adrien Brody nailed it.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaOwh man
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaDefinitely from all films with Predator only the original from 1987 is great. &quot;Predators&quot; is not so unique, but is average at least or quite good production. Predator 2 was not so bad neither. Both don&#39;t have that impact as the oryginal, but they can be enjoyable without desire to rewatch. Aliens vs Predator was awful the continuation much worse and when I was thinking that they can not destroy franchise more was release The Predator which is a complete disaster. Predators have some bullshit (the original also had many but with a charm) and isn&#39;t perfect with the atmosphere but at least this is Predator you know as a hunter who like challenge and this film at least sometimes can build tension. Generally if somebody wants to see more of this allien hunter misnamed as predator then he should watch Predators.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita2010 was such a good year for Predator. This movie and the AVP game were amazing and are extremely underrated.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaOK people who say that this movie was trash are the same ones that want predator from 1986
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe story was a rehash of the first predator!
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe trailer lies showing a scene with 15 shoulder cannon lasers on him but there&#39;s only 3 &#39;bad&#39; predators and the token 1 &#39;good guy&#39; predator. The team loses half their weapons and ammo in the first 5 minutes, a complete waste of time and money. Lawrence Fishburn&#39;s character is only introduced halfway through.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaPretty Good Movie. But wow amazing trailer.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaits not even close to the predator 1987
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWhere are the catholic priest?
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe awesome shot of like 20 predator things going on Adrian Brody would be great if it were IN THE MOVIE and not just there to fool people into buying a ticket<br>Regardless, still a cool movie
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWhy didn‚Äôt they get a sequel!? Instead with got that Predator lore destroying piece of garbage The Predator (2018)...
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is the second best predator movie after Schwarsniger
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaMissing 411.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually good!! The one that just came out though....no
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaSo much better than The Predator (2018) wish this would‚Äôve had a sequel.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaKill or be killed
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI watched the movie at 5 years old :/
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI hate how they got Walt Goggins and Machete to be in this turd.<br>I would not have seen it otherwise
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitapredators vs predators...YOUTUBE IS DRUNK üòÖüòÇ
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaOn one hand, I do think this this is a better Predator movie than The Predator, but on the other I feel it borrows too much from the original film. At least I can say that The Predator was too different. With this movie, it seems more like a copy/paste sorta deal. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt hate either movie, I like them both well enough. I just feel that I can respect The Predator a bit more for having the balls to change things and do things differently than play it safe by copying/pasting certain ideas and plot points.<br><br>To put it simply, I feel that The Predator‚Äôs frustrating mistakes make it more memorable than Predators, which I almost always forget exists.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis one and the Original are the best movies.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI feel like this is the only REAL Predator sequel. Personally a huge favorite for me. Gotta love Royce with that AA-12
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI love part 1 but this was the best Predator movie
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI like so much movies with machete), the last ones is amazing. This movie is in my favorite list on boxxy software
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaIt be awesome if they made a 2nd predators, with a the other people that come at the end except with Adrian brody to.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis one I seen on Showbox, but date have for 2018, which is fucked up.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe movie was great but the trailer is a 5/10
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaOld Painless Jr. at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqYqoVoU74&amp;t=0m32s">0:32</a>
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie wasn‚Äôt that great until the Shane Black predator came out. Now predators is amazing compared to the new one
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaPREDATORS: KILLING MACHINE finale sequel which ties PREDATORS (2010) and THE PREDATOR into a new trilogy. _c.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaEveryone came here after The Predator, lol.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaMy favorite of the Predator saga
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not gonna lie, this wasn&#39;t a great film, the trailer is fantastic though, which lead me to this conclusion:<br>1.Why making different Predators in this movie? If they would have stay with the original concept of the Predator, that would have worked just fine.<br>2. Why casting the guy from that&#39;s 70 show? He&#39;s not menacing at all and his acting sucks.<br>3. Why not writing something FOR the Predator instead of writing AGAINST it? The always tell us the story of how Predators lose against humans... BOORINGGG, make the Predators win for once to show us how menacing this creature is.<br>4. I would have like the story to tell us how the Predators were using this planet to train &quot;new bloods&quot; or hunters with no experience into hunting while having high ranking predators watching them and evaluating them, for example 5 high ranking Predators watching while 3 &quot;newbie&quot; Predators would hunt for recognition of their elders.<br><br>Maybe my ideas are terrible, but I bet is way better than the film they gave us and definitely better than the one from Shane Black which is pure garbage.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is a great movie. Very awesome.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI actually liked this film
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThat trailer gets me every time well done
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaIf they do consider doing a sequel, they should at least get Adrian brody and Alice braga to return as the characters they played and in the first act of the movie being these two finally getting off the planet and returning to earth, only to find out that there‚Äôs another team of predators coming to earth as well to not only bring Royce and Isabelle back, but to retrieve more warriors from earth for their game reserve
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaSadly this movie had the scary vibe to it, other than the new predator film. Shane blacks very was okay, I just wish it was scary like this one.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI liked this movie better then the new one .
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWay way better than that piece of shot out in theaters now.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is a fuckin classic compared to the bullshit that&#39;s out now...Fox should have hired Nimrod Antal again and made a sequel to Predators.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaTo all the folks who hated this movie and kept complaining about it.... How you loving that Shane Black comedy fest now???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis was a good movie plot wise, I just was not a fan of the ‚ÄúSuper Predators‚Äù looks. Head way too big, mandibles way out of proportion, and the idea of 3<br>Of them. Imagine replacing the 3 Predators in this movie with the new upgraded Assassin Predator from the new movie. That would have been a lot cooler.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe new predator movie&#39;s film quality like more older than this one
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie could have been so much better
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaUnderrated movie
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitathis was better then the recent The Predator.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaPredator rules
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe concept for this movie is brilliant. Honestly, this is how a predator tv series could be made, with a cast of new people ever season with some familiar faces who survived before in the previous hunting seasons. Would be cool.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaHonestly this was a well done movie, not better than the first, but it doesn‚Äôt matter cuz I still loved it.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaStill the best Predator sequel I&#39;ve seen since the original, the worst part is the sequel bait ending which all too many films do now, but all in all a decent sequel.  I really haven&#39;t been overly impressed with any of the advertising regarding the newest predator movie, the film looks tonally inconsistent, and early reviews seem to highlight that as a problem.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitawhat is luca changretta doing here
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI always liked the concept presented in this movie, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very good. I definitely think it&#39;s better than AVP and AVP 2.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer on adult swim as a kid, and no believed me when I said a new predator movie was coming out.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita‚ù§ this movie üíØ
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaDecent trailer does not catch my eye i like the new trailer that came out yesterday for the violence and how it made it look like logan but i have not seen this movie because i cant find it any where in stores i could habe got it in a predator set but theni would have have 3 predator 1 and 3 predator 2s
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaHad to revisit this great movie after watching that garbage last trailer for Shane Blacks Michael Bay&#39;d schlock called Predator.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWay better than the 2018 trailer..
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaGood premise to this film and I genuinely enjoyed multiple aspects/sequences of this film.<br> <br>Ultimately and unfortunately, it undermined it&#39;s own originality in the series by copying the first film inappropriately(minigun dude, falling by waterfall, etc.) But the worst offense is when Isabelle reveals to the group how wearing mud helped Dutch survive the encounter with the Predator from the first film, then next sequence, nobody&#39;s wearing any mud. lol <br><br>Given, Royce eventually takes the advice, but still, it&#39;s one of the most irrationally written sequences I&#39;ve ever witnessed in any film and shouldn&#39;t have made the final cut.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie has the right formula..it could have been better. I enjoyed this however, it could have had more twists in the plot and kept us wanting more.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie should have gotten a sequel.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe original battle royal
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThere‚Äôs a scene in this trailer that shows a total of 15 lasers meaning 15 predators but in the movie theres only 4...
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWhy did they change the trailer? If you watch the other ones on YouTube, they&#39;re different...
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaWatch (Arnold loves the  new predators movie) lol
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis was an underrated movie, and the cast was great choice and they did a great job.<br><br>This is also how you do your trailer right! You show very little (if you want to show) of your creature in the trailer. Something the new Alien movie, did not do correctly in their trailer.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated film
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaStill better than Shane Blacks Predator
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is so good imo, I hope they make the official trailer for the movie just good as this and not like the teaser one.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaImo, predators was a good movie, not better than the first 2, but I just love that it doesn&#39;t take place in our planet anymore, and that we see a little bit more about predator conflict with others predators.   My only 2 complains was that there wasn&#39;t enough predators on it, and the way the kill them was mediocre, anyways I would want to see a sequel of this movie, I feel like it has enough potential for a good predator movie.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is how you make a REAL predator movie.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaTo better trailer than the one that we just got today
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is a masterpiece compared to the piece of crap trailer for the new movie i just watched.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis was a good movie
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaShouldn&#39;t there be a part 2?
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqYqoVoU74&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> Remy Denton!
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaFalse F..kin advertisement at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzqYqoVoU74&amp;t=1m23s">1:23</a>!!! In the movie only ONE trilaser on Brody&#39;s face, and this trailer shows more than a dozen trilasers!!!! Thanks buttholes!!
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitathis movie look&#39;s cool
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis is a great film! Must of missed it but will watch soon !!! Also Keep on the look out for Dino Earth : Beyond the Darkness
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaIs Michelle Rodriquez a man or woman?
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaFuck yes!!!!!  There is hope!

uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaVagina Face!!!!! lol
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita1:23 ?
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThis movie is trash if you&#39;re a Predator fan.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitagreat movie, i suggest all go and see its totally worth seeing and will make i happy
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaMake it more gory in the sequel and John Leguizamo needs to Co-Star in the predators sequel, he needs to be in better films. Loved Him and Brody in Summer of Sam, hope they re-team in predators2.  
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaThe movie was a worthy good sequel,
but i don&#39;t know why, no predator movie will ever
outrun the first predator movie! 
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshita@Lokey76 u fucking spoiler
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaawesome movie, loved the yakusa vs. predator scene, old skool samurai showdown fight!!!!
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitarRrRrRr!!!
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaSubtitula P!
Siempre quise un l√°ser de 3 puntos ;)
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitagood job 
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaI loved the movie, it was better than the 2nd. My only problem was the plot hole ending. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t spoil it for you.
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaCOOL! :D
uzqYqoVoU74delimeterByIshitaOK movie, left the same feeling as from previous series
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the test screening for Batman V Superman
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThere dumb if a saw a door slam shut I would be out of that house so fast like white people dont think
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it always in a new house
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaI guess the room is just full of old sperm from 1800 because the title is &quot;The disappointments room&quot;.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaCant wait for the next Underworld with Kate Beckinsale :)<br>Looks like a hard movie.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThe room was empty. Thus the name of the movie The Disappointment Room
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWell this trailer literally told me nothing of the plot...
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitahmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThis looked genuinely unnerving! Good stuff!
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSo behind that door is a...disappointment?
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaY&#39;know what, even if the base premise is unoriginal, the latter half of this trailer isn&#39;t that bad.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitajust watched because of kate Beckinsale
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll drink Kate Beckinsale&#39;s bath water.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaBy the trailer and the comments, people are going to watch this movie because of the actress, maybe.<br>Everything else will be strange to the audience, for example, they bought the house for &quot; a new beginning&quot; but didn&#39;t bother to check the rooms with the realtor. Assuming they bought it online, what is the first thing you do when you buy a house and you arrive for the first time? ...exactly, check the rooms right away but she didn&#39;t do this till we can see her &quot;discovering&quot; that &quot;hidden&quot; door and only because she is following a shadow.<br>Also, if you buy a house and you find it has a statue with no head and hands would you take pictures of it?  It doesn&#39;t make sense.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaHm. I get a real &quot;Shining&quot; vibe from this. Maybe it&#39;ll be better than the usual crap. :p
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSomething tells me that what&#39;s inside the room is going to be a disappointment.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaRemove the word &quot;disappointments&quot; and you have the best movie of all time
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s an idea, STOP MAKING SHIT GHOST MOVIES. Boring cunts.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSo that&#39;s what&#39;s behind Narnia
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitathe disappointments room? ok.. who the hell went into my room without asking me
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll put this movie in my disappointment rooms
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will have people leaving with disappointment
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshita&quot;What&#39;s this? An obviously creepy room that is not on any floor plans of this old, creepy house? I definitely should check it out by myself!&quot; - said no one ever.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie title ever?
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale is the best! &lt;3
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitalove you...kate beckinsale....
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaMY WIFE :)
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s going to take her a whole movie to open up a door??? C&#39;mon
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThumbs Down!
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaMan white folks always have to be exploring stuff, just leave well enough alone.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Based on a true fairytale documentary by a drunk methhead&quot;
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaYou can tell smoking has affected her voice :(
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaShe is so hot
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThe reason it&#39;s called the disappointments room is because they will spend the entire time building up to what&#39;s in the room and it will end with it just being a closet
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaAt least the trailer didn&#39;t show much...
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshita317 up votes to 30 down votes? I don&#39;t get the Internet anymore.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThe Disappointments Room - Inb4 it will be the movie theater
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWhat she finds......................................................... is absolutely nothing. Disappointments Room...
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaNever give anything away very good trailer
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaFilm looks very mediocre, but thats a well cut trailer, not giving away too much, very rare these days
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaI really hope it&#39;s good, for the sake of Kate Beckinsale. She should be a much bigger star than she is. Very talented, was really good in Love &amp; Friendship this year, I want to see more of her. (And not just in a dirty way.)
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThat was rather.......disappointing for a trailer.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaBased on true events. Exaggerated to maximum effect.<br><br>Fixed that for you. :)
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale should have been wonder woman.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSo an old house, haunted by dead kids. We&#39;ve never seen that before....
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaDisappointments room? That kinda sounds like my room... where I keep all my dreams and aspirations.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSo I have to pay 12 bucks to find out whats in that room?
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaBoooooooo
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaTons of cliches
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWhy not call the police and have them open the door it seems pretty suspicious to me that there would be a random un opened door in the house
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaHey, this isn&#39;t underworld!
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaI am going back, getting bored you know.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaa white family moves into an old house with a dark past and probably haunted. i havent seen that before.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaSpiler alert that room she enters in is a disappointment
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaFun fact about this movie&#39;s title:<br>That&#39;s exactly how my parents refer to my place
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWait is this the chick who did the underworld movies?? Because I haven&#39;t seen her in a movie since though Kirk she&#39;s been in hibernation or something
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaFinally enters the room and gets disappointed. Been there, done that
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaThe Disappointments trailer, amIright?
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is full of disappointments
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaMovie ending: ends up being a torture room. Guy who lived there before tortured people. Saved you 10.95.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaCliche plot but a good, intriguing trailer. Might watch if the reviews are good.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitabased on true events really are you crazy or am i?!
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaGreat, another witty heartfelt comedy from Beckinsale.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaFamily moving to new house:                                   Check<br>Character saying it&#39;s a &quot;new beginning&quot;:                 Check<br>Mysterious locked room in basement:                    Check<br>One parent slowly going insane:                               Check<br>Other parent trying to fix it all, but will likely die:    Check<br>Quiet kid that will likely save the day:                      Check<br><br>OK folks... Looks like we&#39;ve got us all the tropes for another shitty horror movie that will be forgotten before it&#39;s even out of theaters.
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaMore Like a &#39;A Disappointing Movie,Again&#39; XD
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitadisappointments room? you mean my room?
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitastill using the stocky creepy little girl laugh I see
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaWow they made the no man&#39;s sky movie really quick
O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaDissapointment room? Who inside? Me??? <b>Cries under the bed</b>

O7a-hmoh6JwdelimeterByIshitaFirst
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaahhhh...another movie from a good war, where the enemies got defeated, the opponent had a clear cut villain image and afterwards glory and victory awaited! It is even psychological, with all the crap that is now enfolding in Iraq and Afghanistan where veterans are asking themselves, what the heck all the fighting in falludscha was about in the end!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaIs Shia Labeouf going to wear a paper bag on his head in this movie? 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about time we had another solid World War Two movie focused on tanks. 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWoof Woof!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaIF anyone was curious, the tank they are using is a M4A3E8 or &quot;Easy Eight&quot; Sherman. Basically just an up-armored and quicker variant of the classic M4
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaShia LaBeouf in this movie &quot;No No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No¬†No No No!&quot;
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaMy brother and dad worked on this! I am looking forward to seeing it in the cinema :)
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt is the man.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitapeople enough war movies, it&#39;s really getting extremely boring!!!¬†
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaLieutenant Aldo Raine is back!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaNot much into war movies but this looks good, it looks like they picked a nice variety of actors.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWhat Percy doing over here..
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWhen did Brad Pitt develop this weird WWII fetish?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaThat Sherman has week armor , wtf is it thinking fighting with a Tiger :/
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNHuK1rteF4&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> ?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt fighting Nazis once again.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaanother try hard movie
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaThey call themselves the &quot;Bastards&quot;
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaDat Mustache
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitait looks good and has potential but they&#39;ve probably fucked it up anyway. No doubt brad pitt is going to be a super soldier that knows everything about war, the love interest is going to ruin the movie and then most of the facts are gonna be way off. im gonna bet that this movie is far too much of a spin-off epic exaggeration of the real history to call itself a WW2 movie, it&#39;ll probably end up as a glorified COD movie.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaMassive fan of End of Watch so I&#39;ll give this ago, trailer looks decent. 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshita&quot;Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y&#39;all will git me one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazis. Or you will die tryin&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Oh. ¬†Wrong movie.¬†
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaNo ice.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWow this looks solid <br>Waiting for the movie to hit theatres...!!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitalol,¬†Shia LaBeouf, SO BADASS!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaMore dirt.  More hunky men.  More cigarettes.  And...action.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaShia 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaLogan!!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaStill doesn&#39;t come close to The Longest Day.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaThe &#39;stache.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaSorry but it is boring
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaanother bullshit movie, first of all, the red tails, and now this. amies always think everybody is idiot just like themselves....
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt, Jon Bernthal, Scott Eastwood, Xavier Samuel, Jason Isaacs, and Michael Pena will make the movie.<br><br>Shia LaBeouf will come to close to ruining it.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaIt will probably just end like saving private ryan
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitacool cast looking forward to it!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaOMG UUUH, that walking dead guy is in this! i hated him. won&#39;t be able to watch this and seeing that guy without thinking of Shan
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaFor years I&#39;ve been in hunger for tank movies, I&#39;m so watching this in cinema :)
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaMERICA MOTHER FUCKERS
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks dull as f*ck.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitai was hoping to be the first commenter, but okay
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaShane!!!! Why doesn&#39;t Jon Bernthal get mentioned in the movies he&#39;s in?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshita300<br>The newest version of Spartans¬†
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshita&#39;Muricans good. Germans bad. Got it chief. Nice production values though. 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAn I the only one who thinks that the Shermans desperately needed bigger guns? Seriously I&#39;ve heard stories where they peppered tiger tanks at close range only to get blasted apart in one shot!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaBidness is still boomin&#39;
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaHas anyone made an inglorious basterds 2 joke yet?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAnother war movie
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitahey i thought shia stopped making movies what is this is shia cg ?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAm I the only one had goose bumps while watching this?
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitamore WW2 shit....
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWorld of Tanks: The Movie
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaI think shia is a amazing actor just amazing but he might be a little stupid that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t act 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAre You Kidding Me, What A Load Of Bullshit Propaganda. If You Believe This Crap You&#39;d Believe Anything. Looks Like It Has Good Production Values And A Good Cast But I Mean Come On, Give Us Something That Is Realistic..¬†
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitathis is a bad movie
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAs a player of WOT, i got see this!

DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaSHANE!!!
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshita300 vs 5? I bet some will have a nice K/D score in the end...
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaShia LaBeouf is a cock......not sure If i can watch this film
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWait... Shia LaBeouf AND Logan Lerman in a WWII movie? That&#39;s something I never would have seen coming. 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaYES A WAR MOVIE WITH A TANK IN IT I HAVE AN OBBSESSIN WITH TANKS SO YEA

DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaHey! It&#39;s the movie where Shia LaBeouf went batshit repeatedly on set.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaWe need¬† WW3 just to provide new¬† movie material. Seriously, can we go a year without a WW2 movies
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaI loved end of watch, like most of the cast except shia so I&#39;m watching this in the movie theatre when it&#39;s released. 
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaLooks like a boring battle war movie which everyone has done already.. Nice 1.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I CAN&#39;T WAIT
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaI hated End of Watch.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaSo dissappointed with this trailer!! I hope the movie isn&#39;t as bad as this trailer.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAnother war movie
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaThis is the movie where shia went crazy when they made it. He refused to shower for weeks and everyone on set disliked him.
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaBtw 5th
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaLooks promising<br>
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshita4th
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaAldo the Apache
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaSecond
DNHuK1rteF4delimeterByIshitaFirst
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaRick Riordan needs to write and new series tied to <b>Percy Jackson</b> that deals with Celtic, Taoist, Shinto, Mesopotamian, and Slavic mythology in America.<br>And I want to know if nephilim (half-human/half-angel) and cambions (half-human/half-demon) exist in the Riordanverse as well.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI don‚Äôt think the director read the book............
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNhV8dk6W2M&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> Is that freaking Omega Symbol?
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaWell Disney bought the studio I&#39;m hoping they can do a better job.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaRead the books first so mad at this director
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is more accurate than both movies combined.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaDang I remember seeing this trailer on my DVD copy of Ice Age 3.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this same trailer back in 2009 when I was12. I was SO MUCH HYPED. If only I knew what was coming...
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawhat music is in this trailer?
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else remember watching this trailer for the first time and thanking the gods that this was finally happening, what a disaster this turned out to be, and I know he he was a little old for the part, but Logan Lerman as Percy was such perfect casting, he is basically what I see in my head when I read the books, such a perfect casting gone to waste
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaThe Trailers were looked like the book! BUT when you watch the movie... nothing. And they shouldn&#39;t delete the scenes in the Infrimary and Grover talks about Thalia, hell yeah. and now look like they will not make anymore movies. You know I think FOX you will better to sell this SERIES copyrights to Dreamworks or Disney or SOMEONE who can make this movie a commerical success!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaSo different from the book... Where&#39;s Ares, Clarisse, Dionysus, Echidna, etc? :S
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m beginning to wonder if this would&#39;ve been better off as a cartoon.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaSo...just looking at the teaser....what happened? The teaser was spot on (minus the light show) to the book...what happened? did they film this scene and then accidentally grabbed the wrong script? Was there a re-write after this teaser was released? Why wasn&#39;t ANY of this in the movie? WHAT HAPPENED? I love the books so much, but I&#39;m also a film student and know not everything can be done....but...gods take out the whole &quot;Percy needs to FIND the pearls&quot; and you have room for a more accurate story! So how come the teaser tallier is more accurate that ANY scene, line, even moment of the movie! to me this doesn&#39;t make sense. Fox...did you rewrite the script after this scene was shot...that&#39;s the only thing that explains it...and honestly...you should have stuck to the original if it is a case of the movie got a rewrite. The Percy Jackson sires is such a great telling of the myths with also keeping them fresh with a modern twist. The plots are incredibly well developed and have already been written for MIDDLE SCHOOLERS! Yet they can appeal to everyone....The only points that should have been cut were ones that didn&#39;t have a huge part to the rest of the ENTIRE (Heroes of Olympus included) series....so Fox congratulations on having the rights to an amazing BOOK series.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitafor the director i would like to say ¬† <del>------------------------------</del>&gt;¬† ¬†PLEASE READ THE BOOK FIRST
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaTo say the book was better is a gross understatement. No offence to the actors; they did a terrific job! But the plot itself, Nah! If I were Mr. Riordan, I will never allow Fox to ruin my other books.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI watched Percy Jackson and the Olympians lightning thief but never read the book.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaAs a fan of the book series, honestly I was not impressed with this adaptation of the first book at all. Shocking how the director of the first 2 &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films decided to make the characters of Percy (who looks much like Logan Lerman) and Annabeth older and that Grover was played by an African-American actor. Most of the stars in this film I knew and consider great actors- but the casting could have been done better and would have done the book some more justice. Book was WAY BETTER than this! Dreamworks currently has a petition to remake the first two film adaptations. As long as they are more true to the books what could be better than that? I was also surprised Rick Riordan liked that the characters were played by older actors. It is his book, so he has all rights and say to it. This got a 6/10 rating from me. No doubt a lot of other fans of him were disappointed how this on screen adaptation twisted up the story.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawhy this scene is not in the movie? :c
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOMG that fucking bitch that think Percy cannot fight at 12 well Mr. Dumpshit he is a FREAKING DEMIGOD he is supposed 2 do that kind of shit  
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s why this movie is EPIC.. the director is from HARRY FUCKING POTTER &lt;3
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitathis movie sucked gargantuine donkey dick! 
Why Chris Columbus? 
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaThe books always appears to be better, &amp; sometimes it is. I saw this movie before I read the book, &amp; it inspired me to read the book.This means I thought the movie was pretty cool. I watched the movie again, after I read the book &amp; still thought the movie was great; small things like Annabeth&#39;s hair didn&#39;t bother me much, but that&#39;s just me, &amp; compared to other books that have become movies this movie wasn&#39;t that bad. I only hope book two is made into a movie before &quot;Percy&quot; starts to look 30.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita@purgecasper you can see it before its out, they have pirated versions. I hate the bots too
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita@goddimmus   read duh booook!!!! its mmuch better!!!! READ IT PLS!!!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potter kids got too old and now they need a new franchise huh. Same crap. Random kid big destiny blah blah blah.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitathe book is gayyy
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI loveeeee this movie
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita@StillLovingyu i totally agree with you, annabeth seemed like such a tomboy in the book, even thou she turned it around and became a little more girly in the 3rd book.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawanna see this soooo bad!!!! it looks awesome!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawish there was Kratos in this movie lol
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawhy are all you guys all over the interent lying about movies that havent even come out yet. and saying you saw them to get people to go on your crappy movie sites.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitavery true. it does happen to often. and yes, there are alot of flaws.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just another bad movie being made from a good book.  It happens too often.  I can see too many flaws in just a trailer.  And I mean a different trailer, not this one.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawow. this movie will prob. be a bad one. but i wanna see the movie anyway.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita@DieNoSoar  of course not i dun read books..............hahaha kiddin but t this book

rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitayeah i know but i live in switzerland and i need to wait for the fifth book til march... it really sucks... ;-p

rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI read the book for a report but I never knew I would love it so much! I just finished the Sea of Monsters today! But I thought Olympus was light. It looks more like the underworld.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaTo the Gods!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a staggeringly obvious Harry Potter rip off
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaMe too!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI absouloutley love the book im so happy theyre making a movie
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai read all thebooks
THREE TIMES I WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!11
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI never read the book, but I love greek mythology.  I would like to see this movie.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOMG! This is my favorite book series! Can&#39;t wait!!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE this Series!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaAnd Dionysus is way too hot. -.- He&#39;s supposed to be short and pudgy, they even said so in the books, in the Battle of the Labyrinth, they see a picture and Percy says they made Dionysus too handsome.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaUgh, the cast sucks, they made Annabeth ugly, and Grover&#39;s black. x.x They&#39;ll completely butcher the movie.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI loved this book!!

I read all of them, and I was so sad when the series ended. 

But I AM PSYCHED BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING A MOVIE!! YES!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai think the heaven or what ever it was called is supposed to be really pretty its kind of scary lol and who cares how old percy looks
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI am really looking forward to this movie. Hopefully Percy will took the torch after the end of our beloved Harry Potter series.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitathe books were awesome i wanna seee the moooviiie!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshita3 words:CAN NOT WAIT!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai honestly am realy fuqin pissed at this stupid ass trailer. i konw its supposed to be a teaser but i loved the  percy jackson series finished it last night. but i cant wait for the movie to come out and i want to see more. plz someone update me on the real trailer
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOH MAN I LOVED THIS BOOK and ive been waiting for 3 months on hold for the new one at my library
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaok, i am so man with this movie, I was so excited for it, because I liked the books, but (if you read the book, you&#39;ll agree how messed up this is) everyone is like, 16. the whole book plot was him BECOMING 16 IN THE LAST BOOK. and yes, annabeth is blonde, grover was described as white (not being racist). and PERCY WAS 12.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayaqyayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayyayyayyayyayayayayayyayayayayayayayayayyayayayayayayayayayayayayayayyayyyaayyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaMeh, I can deal with Grover being black. I always imagined him as Mexican, anyway, mostly because of his love affair with burritos.

Well! Mount Olympus looks pretty cool, although decidedly less bright, sunshiney, and sparkly than I imagined it to be. Good, at least they aren&#39;t screwing it up *too* badly...
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaIm pretty sure noone in hollywood is messed up in the head enough to make Annabeth a slut.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitatrue and alot better since those books are shorter than Harry Potter ones,
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitapercy looks a little old.  by the time they finish the fifth he&#39;ll be 23 O_o

but its the director of harry potter so he&#39;ll probably do a good job sticking to the book.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOMFG CANT WAIT!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitatwilight is a rubbish romance novel harry potter is a fantasy...they shuldnt b judged together...
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaomg no way!! I CANT BELIEVE IT! IM LIKE SPAZZING! haha i cant for it to be out!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they insist on using adrogynous looking males all the time? Jesus Christ, I mean seriously, what tha F?!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaawesome book
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI JUST WORKED ON THIS MOVIE 2 WEEKS AGO.

rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitatrue
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!! When I tell my friend about this I know she&#39;ll flip out!!!!!!!!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitabelieve me, i think most of us did read cirque du freak.... and yeah, it&#39;s awesome, really.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI suppose they want him to be older in the movie ... maybe 14 or 15!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaomg :D i really love the books and i hope so much they don&#39;t mess it up..or i&#39;ll kill them^^
and i hate the girl playing annabeth...she doesn&#39;t even look a bit like her..and she&#39;s horrible xD
can&#39;t wait to see the movie :)
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai cant waint i almost screamed at the movie theader watchinf HARRY POTTER
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaYeah I think its going ruin the movie.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitais this a actual movie ?&gt;???
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaAbout which film-hero would be the successor to Harry Potter ... Percy Jackson or Septimus Heap!

That means, which book series will become a movie series ... not only a single movie! Understand?
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaMe too! XD except the yes part.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai know look on imdb
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaWhen I saw this at HP, I was like, &quot;No.  It can&#39;t be.&quot;
And then it was. :DDDDDDd
Ohlord. &lt;3
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaOk... the actor who&#39;s playing Percy looks a little to old.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitai just got the book and m reading it and now im sooooo happy thier making a film
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitawhat are you talking about!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI suppose it will be the successor of the Harry Potter series ... if not then Septimus Heap will maybe! ^^
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI¬¥ve only red the first book ( cuz that¬¥s the only one tankobon in german ).
But I liked it very much. The story has the same charme like the first few Harry Potter books ... but it¬¥s even more adventurous!
I hope the movie will be as good as the book ... so that they don¬¥t stop filming after this first movie ( as happened with Eragon, His dark materials, The Dark is rising, Inkheart, etc. )
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. I started to read the book but then school ended for summer break. I got to page 225.
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaholy crap I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to wait!!!!!
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaz0mg
rNhV8dk6W2MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never read the books maybe I should start? Cuz this looks awesome!!!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitasome movies have trailers that reveal everything, every plotpoint and twist. this must be the most opposite of that I&#39;ve ever seen, because it really didn&#39;t say anything of what it&#39;s about
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshita...and then Ronaldinho said &quot;fuck all of this shit, I&#39;m playing futbol&quot; :-D
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie endings I&#39;ve ever seen because the ship&#39;s arrival was a very hard cut to the story before which showed perfectly that they entered a completely new world with its own story and people
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Apocalypto&quot; is a masterpiece. I&#39;ve <del>bought the bootlegged dvd</del> borrowed the dvd from my aunt which lives in US and because I couldn&#39;t find the subtitles in its menu I&#39;ve honestly thought it&#39;s a movie played in Mayan only (like &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; played entirely in Old Aramaic). I&#39;ve watched it and I liked it so much that when my wife came home I&#39;ve played the movie for a second time and while watching it I was translating to her, step by step what was my interpretation of their dialogue in Mayan. Anyways, weeks later, by accident I&#39;ve found the subtitles hidden by mistake in a submenu and when I&#39;ve played it I was shocked to discover that my explanations were spot on, almost 100%. The whole movie is perfect; the way it was directed, the scenes, the script, the characters and their flawless act, everything is so beautifully put together that you can watch it with no subtitles at all. Try it. This is a work of a genius.<br>PS<br> Later on I&#39;ve bought a legit dvd for my good movies collection. It deserves this statute
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaMovie was so good! 
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaEPIC
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaFor anyone wondering... those were the MAYANS.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaque pelicula tan mala
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitawhere is the spanol invasion ?
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshita
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when I was 10 I cried cause there was so much blood  :( but now I&#39;m 13 I watche DIY
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaFucking piece of shit. I almost fell asleep during the movie.  Braveheart was a masterpiece, no doubt, but seriously this is a piece of shit. Save your time. Never watch it.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaWhat a giddy mix of south american history - Mayan&#39;s who were mostly farmers ¬†acting like Aztec&#39;s and Spaniards arriving on the scene at least 350 years early
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThere is a new Mayan action movie like Apocalypto that came out between 2012-2013 if you know the title please let me know I been looking to watch it
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaawesome!!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaBU FILMIN 2 SI VAR MI__?
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis is a masterpiece of a movie.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis film is shit. People are not as liked both, oh wait, it&#39;s because they know nothing about ancient cultures in Mexico and are driven by a film overvalued. The culture that is portrayed here is more like the chichimeca even the Mexica but no resemblance to the true mayan culture.¬†¬†it does not take a historian to realize that this movie is garbage because the director had no idea about the differences between the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie 3/4 years ago and now i am downloading again, is a excellent movie, believe!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaIts a great movie, even with that bigoted dick-wad behind the lens....well done Mel - redemption!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitagreat movie shows how human are the worst animal
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitatruly a great film, its story,directing,costumes etc etc etc etc should have afforded this film much more praise then it received but because it was Mel directing it didnt do so well...HOLLYWOOD IS A CORRUPT AND PATHETIC film industry! one of my favorites!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie, even though Mel gibs lost the plot a bit i still enjoyed this film
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaSo glad to see a movie about Native Americans before Europeans interfered. Would love to see one about the North Eastern Natives of North America. (I&#39;m¬†Kanienkehaka) But any North American tribe would suffice.¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaawesome movie ever.¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is amazing BUT This trailer is a shit.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis is seriously the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen when i was like 15 years old. I&#39;ve been searching for the title of it For the past 6 YEARS. I&#39;ve FINALLY FOUND IT.¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitado they even talk in this movie? Would you reccomend to see it with my friends or is this a movie i should watch alone?¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaone of the best film¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThe killing of his father is totally The Scorpion King at minute 15. LoL<br>Recycle-movie.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngWBddVNVZs&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a><br>does that kid have on braces?¬†<br><br>nooo. ¬† ?
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitai dont know bout history but this movie is awesome !
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaBice movies. .I liked. 
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitai had to take a shower after watching this...
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitathis is a great movie but people need to understand that it is NOT ACCURATE. so stop bitching!!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis move is crazy omg I totally recommend 
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaSuch a great fuckin movie.¬†
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThe Mayans had dreads.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThe ending was retarded. They show up with a &quot;cross&quot; and &quot;a bible&quot; and the indians kneel down??? WTF??? What would most likely have happened then would be that the indians had killed the priest or whatever and boiled him, maybe throwing the bible and cross onto the fire. That&#39;s what usually happened during first contact events.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was far too slow &amp; the directing was bad. Braveheart &amp; The Passion of the Christ were excellent... then this piece of shit comes along.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaLove how Mel Gibson created such a masterpiece of my ancestry The Aztecs üíû
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaGibson can direct the hell out of anything. I don&#39;t care that he&#39;s a racist religious fundamentalist, I don&#39;t have to talk to the guy, I just want to see cool movies. Let him make some more cool movies.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaSuper hit movie...
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThe best scene in this movie is at the end when the whites come in the boats. History shows that when the whites come to your country, you are truly fucked because history shows that every continent they come to they come to kill, steal and destroy.¬† The sad part about this legacy¬† is that it is still going on to this day.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitamel gibson&#39;s movie always makes my jaw drop
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitathis is some rigged comments
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie..I recommend it to anyone (mature audience&#39;s only)
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI really love this movie
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaIncredible masterpiece, the message behind this movie speaks volumes...
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so enjoys in this movie, but that is fu*king insane culture.

ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaMy All time favorite Movie from Hollywood. - An Indian
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is great. But crazy mel put his name at least four times in the credits before giving credit to the cast. The cast was epic. Amazing actors.¬†

ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaSo...do i have to like, read?
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaOne word... UNDERRATED.
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI really do hope Mel Gibson makes more movies there soooooooo friking good! A follow up to this would be ace! Especially with the Spanish arriving on the shores. Please Mel make a follow up!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaI remember when this came out, i never saw it though, i just remembered about it because of a facebook status about ants biting power on wounds, people said it was also in this movie...so i may finally get this and watch it lol.

ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitano, sacrifices are awesome

ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaThis was such a good movie, I remember watching it when I was younger. It really makes you feel a bit better about our society -knowing that we don&#39;t do sacrifices any more. Right?
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitaNiice film!
ngWBddVNVZsdelimeterByIshitagreat movie! ...will be waiting for part 2 :)
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI really like the actors but I hate that movie already.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLiterally the only interest I have in this is Chris Hemsworth.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThor drops the hammer and picks up axes instead.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThe Huntsman<br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Huntsman%D0%9B%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%95%D0%A6%D0%AA%D0%A2-1501151390170636/?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/The-Huntsman%D0%9B%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%95%D0%A6%D0%AA%D0%A2-1501151390170636/?fref=ts</a>
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potter, Hobbit, Frozen. Shit copy!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaYou know, they should&#39;ve made this a Snow Queen twisted tale &amp; call it &quot;The Ice Queen&quot;. Cause Emily is playing a Ice Queen &amp; that&#39;s kinda a Snow Queen-ish figure would you think so? Please let me know, thank you!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaTwo bitches working at it...I must watch!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t the first huntsman movie suck enough they wanted to make a sequel the sucks even more.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaJessica Chastain, Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt in one movie. <br>One part of my body will definitly enjoy this movie !
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaEmily Blunt is a small Meryl Streep? she can play everything?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitawasnt it that the huntsman&#39;s wife name was Sara? Jessica&#39;s character name is Sara. So if this is some kind of prequel/sequel she should die in the middle of the movie by the queen.Cause she killed her, that was the story of the huntsman in snow white, maybe its just a prequel so that&#39;s why the queen says to the huntsman that she missed him. cause in snow white the both of them know each other. she killed her wife.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s rare to see a mediocre film to spin off its only 2 compelling characters
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitapffffttttt this looks dumb as hell, just like the first one
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWHere is kristen stewart? (thank god she isnt here) but what happened?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI will admit, this actually looks freaking awesome. And by that I don&#39;t mean the greatest movie ever, I just mean it looks like a fun movie to just go to the theater and see.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaHALSEY HELL YES
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThor no te mueras
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaSubtitle : Thor&#39;s holiday
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathis looks bloody awesome and epic and I cannot freaking wait till it comes out!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIs this a prequel?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaCharlize Theron looks so flawless. Im so happy that she&#39;s back!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathought Charlize Theron, died in the last film.?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLong before the evil Queen Ravenna (Theron) was thought vanquished by Snow <br>White&#39;s blade, she watched silently as her sister, Freya(Blunt), suffered a <br><br>heartbreaking betrayal and fled their kingdom. With Freya&#39;s ability to freeze any <br><br>enemy, the young ice queen has spent decades in a remote wintry palace raising a <br>legion of deadly huntsmen-including Eric (Hemsworth) and warrior Sara (Chastain) <br>-only to find that her prized two defied her one demand: Forever harden your <br>hearts to love. <br><br>When Freya learns of her sister&#39;s demise, she summons her remaining soldiers to <br>bring the Magic Mirror home to the only sorceress left who can harness its power. <br>But once she discovers Ravenna can be resurrected from its golden depths, the <br>wicked sisters threaten this enchanted land with twice the darkest f Drce it&#39;s ever <br>seen. Now, their amassing army shall prove undefeatable... unless the banished <br>huntsmen who br oke their queen&#39;s cardinal rule can fight their way back to one <br>another.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t think it&#39;s a prequel
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLooks like all style over substance and kinda bland tbh. Dem ladies, tho...
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLol they copied the scene with the freezing flowers at 0.23 from harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban...
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS SO GOOD !!!!!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaJessica Chastain, Charlize Theron, and Emily Blunt in one movie + Chris Hemsworth. this cast is perfect! üôå
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaPOWERFUL is the word! AMAZING!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song called ?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThis prequel/sequel is based off of The Brothers Grimm&#39;s Snow White and Hans Christian Anderson&#39;s The Snow Queen. Yes, if this upcoming film does well, then there will be more films that could tie other folktales into the franchise. Fairy tales such as, &quot;Briar Rose or The Sleeping Beauty&quot;,&quot;The Frog Prince,&quot; and &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel&quot; could be possible show up in the cinematic universe
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or does a lot of the CGI look pretty bad? Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W65ndip7MM&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a> looks pretty shitty.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaTheron. Blunt. Chastain. - OMG - Dream Cast !!! &lt;3
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIf all 40-ish women looked as bomb as Charlize Theron then I swear to God I&#39;d marry in my 40&#39;s...or maybe just go for 40-year old women altogether. Lol
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitabad CGI
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing I can say that I like is the cast and the visuals. Other than that.....T_T
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaFrom Sicario this, Emily!? That paycheck better be worth this.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaChris Hemsworth is the Huntmans, Charlize Theron is the Evil Queen and Emily Blunt is Badass Elsa.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaTake and ounce of Frozen, two ounces of Game of Thrones, add a pinch of computer graphics and medieval Magic Mike to compensate the lack of gore and soft porn, mix, stir, serve and see your bank account swells....remember, under not circumstance add Kristen Stewart, it ruins the taste.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathis looks INCREDIBLE<br>and Emily Blunt as Ice Queen looks like the evil version of Daenerys Targaryen.... just me?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaQuite the cast - Charlize, Emily, and Jessica, in particular.<br><br>Charlize Theron was the absolute best thing about the last one - which was an admittedly disappointing movie, overall - and I&#39;d probably watch this again for her alone, but having Emily Blunt as her evil sister kinda seals the deal. For now, this looks really good.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI wish Kristen was in this :(<br>and some of the animations (like the ice powers, and Charlize&#39;s powers) look so fake I hope it&#39;s better in the movie
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIM HERE FOR HALSEY AND ONLY HALSEY
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI want see Kristen
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLot of dodgy accents in this trailer.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaso, frozen meets avengers?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaso where did Snow White go?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI guess Elsa and Ana dont lovee ach other anymore
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitakinda sad that we already know how it will end :/
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t the mirror only a voice inside Ravenna&#39;s head? How does it make you the most &quot;powerful of them all&quot;? Where&#39;s Finn? Wasn&#39;t he the one that killed Sarah? Where was Freya when Ravenna fled with Finn? Wasn&#39;t Snow White supposed to remind the huntsman to Sarah? I mean, that they were supposed to be similar? Sarah looks like a blood thirsty murderer, unlike how Snow White was before being waked up from the apple&#39;s poison.<br>And then, the whole visuals are quite different, specially Charlize when she says &quot;Hello, little sister, we have much to do&quot;. She looks like another character, the costumes don&#39;t seem similar at all to what she was wearing in SWATH. She looks more like a Dior commercial... And then, that &quot;I&#39;ve missed you huntsman&quot; feels completely out of character to what Ravenna was. I mean, didn&#39;t she had a hate towards men and how they used women? And she never laughed nor had any sort of sense of humor.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathe huntsman vs alice through the looking glass vs warcraft vs gods of egypt.....who will win?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWow, Frozen 2 is out.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaCharlize is a beast!!! In a good way...And then there is Chris Hemsworth. Need I say anything else?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaOh my gooooooosh !!! Can&#39;t wait ! I&#39;m a big fan of Emily Blunt. She loooooks great. \^_^/
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AWESOME
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaOST pls
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s both a prequel and sequel to help better understand the story. What I&#39;m wondering about is, if Chastain is playing Sara how could she be alive unless she&#39;s resurrected? Or maybe a different Sara.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThe Snow White Expanded Universe!! Hollywood has gone too far!!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathe new Frozen movie looks so much better than the first one
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaWhat so is this a prequel or sequel?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitai like the girls. change the name to &quot;queens: evil and ice&quot; and i would so be down
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaChris Hemsworth is back - smashing things :D
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThe plot in the description confused me.  like, was I the only one??
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaShit trailer but it has an amazing cast so I definitely want to see this.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitalooks good can&#39;t wait
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThose pink flowers that iced up was exactly like HP-PoA. I will miss KStew.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI wish they would stick with Florence Welch for the theme song.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaJessica look so badass!!!! I love her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI hated the first movie, so hopefully this one doesn&#39;t suck (especially because Bella Swan isn&#39;t in it). The CGI is mostly great but still needs some work like here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W65ndip7MM&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a>
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathe costumes of the evil queen were better in the first movie. In this one they look too much, overdone.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaok , this is much better !!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaUnderwhelming. It looks seriously bad. Jessica, Emily &amp; Charlize are such fabulous actresses (I want one of them to play Captain Marvel btw) but this is the most unnecessary sequel to a terrible movie ever made. I have a bad feeling about this one. Kristen Stewart was terrible in the first one but she wasn&#39;t the only thing wrong with that movie.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThis would&#39;ve been so much more interesting if the sisters were the main characters and the huntsman didn&#39;t really matter.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W65ndip7MM&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a> love how trailers overdub lines in the film that obviously are different just for the trailer&#39;s sake.

_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaA badass Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff?.....I&#39;m In
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care, I like it!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaI wish Kristen Stewart were still in the film, because her Snow White was fuckin&#39; ace and I liked her and the Huntsman together in the first film<br>And I don&#39;t have to squint to tell which pale white blond lady is which <br>Plus her fight against Ravenna had more emotional significance than a bunch of typical overskilled action heroes fighting an overpowered villain
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaFrozen, the adult live action version
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaElza??
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaOkay so I&#39;m confused because at the first [art of the trailer I thought it was a prequel, but the last bit implies it comes after SWATH? What&#39;s happening?
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaKristen?üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§îüò°ü§îüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaravenna was the mirror<br>i can&#39;t breathe
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitathis looks.........AWESOME
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshita1
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaIt looks visually stunning, but the last movie has me cautious.<br><br>Also, as someone taking a grammar class, I&#39;m begging whoever&#39;s in charge: PLEASE put a colon after Huntsman! Without it, Huntsman is serving as an adjective for Winter. Has anyone ever experienced a Huntsman Winter? I haven&#39;t.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThat was unexpectedly good.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitais it  prequel or sequel ????
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaeu to meio tonto aqui<br>um pouco abalado
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaPretty good trailer with some nice visual effects. Are Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain in the wrong roles? Chastain strikes me much more as an evil queen, whereas Blunt seems more appropriate for an edgier, action orientated character. Love them both though.
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaNo Kristen Stewart? THANK GOD!!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awesome! Can&#39;t wait for it!!!
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaCharlize Theron is so graceful, her outfits are always on point
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaüòç
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaCharlize Theron, Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain in 1 film!!! <b>I need this film NOW</b>
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING Cheers from Greece
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaCrazy how much better the sequel looks without the mouth breather
_W65ndip7MMdelimeterByIshitaSo Excited!!!

2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitathe road!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaNot to the innocent people they shoot at
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song that starts at 1:40?
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitamy favorite movie ever
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI lost 30 IQ points by reading your comment
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaFantastic film.
Still, I wonder what it is Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Luc Besson have against white guys with dreds.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaTake a look at the first publication of wikileaks, and ask again.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThe troops were fighting in Brixton you idiot
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaIt seems way different than the book
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaActually, the name &quot;Theo&quot; comes from the Greek name &quot;Theodoras&quot; which means &quot;Gift of God.&quot; It was a common name in the early 19th century for people of the church and soldiers. 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWow, what an impressive comment... You can practically see the intelligence just pouring out of your words. Do I even have to check to see if you&#39;re from the United States? Just did. Hahahahahahaha Wow, never fails to surprise me how pathetically stupid people are when given a keyboard instead of crayons. 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think people properly understand the thematic elements of the film. You see, Theo (in ancient Greek) means God, Clive Owen&#39;s character is essentially the God in Christian mythology, bringing the baby (Jesus) into the world. There&#39;s so many religious elements I simply couldn&#39;t fit them in, but for example when he meets Kee she&#39;s in a barn (manger). Whether Owen&#39;s character is actually God or he&#39;s Joseph and God is working by proxy through i&#39;m i&#39;m not too sure that&#39;s up to you :P
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaSuch a touching story. :)
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaExcellent movie, very Powerful, IMHO close to a 10/10. Seriously
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThanks! this looks great any more suggestions? I&#39;m desperate for underrated movies like these sick of all these cgi hollywood movies
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaleon: the professional
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaLuv kee‚ô•‚ô•
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshita&#39;UTOPIA&#39;!!!!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaIncredible concept. One o the best ive ever known. I&#39;ll have to see this.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaY tu Mama Tambien
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaAgreed
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitalife is beautiful...it is consider by many the best foreign movie best seller movie in the US. Its an Italian movie.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaAny other movies just as good as this one. Any suggestions?
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaHappened in the book. 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaBrilliant.  Frightening. Depressing.
Possible.

Any hope for us?
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaYou know what would have sucked? If she gave birth to a boy.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaeasily one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen. an amazing, outstanding movie.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaNice. What are you adding? A couple I would personally add are Almost Famous and Wall-E
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI agree. I&#39;m making a video about the Best Movies of the Decade for the 2000s, and this is one of them 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWOW...This is what&#39;s going on in Britain while The Handmaids Tale is going on in the U.S. er, Gilead.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaPRIVATE ARE YOU NOT WEARING ANY PANTS?!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThis movie is just completely overlooked by mainstream movie viewers. It&#39;s gotta be one of the best movies from the last 10 years.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaMore people gotta watch this masterpiece 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWell, I&#39;m in my mid 30&#39;s and quite a heavy smoker, so I don&#39;t expect to live for more than another 30 or 40 years,
Probably much less, And really, who cares about who or what gets left behind when you&#39;ve gone to your grave?
You won&#39;t be around to see it anyway!

Sure, most people have it programmed into their brains that it&#39;s their &quot;duty&quot; to keep the human race going and that anything else would be selfish,
So what&#39;s wrong with being selfish? I don&#39;t hurt anyone. We just die out, that&#39;s all,
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThis film came out in 2006, but I&#39;ve put off watching until now.
Why? Well, because the subject matter appalls me!

I mean, people can&#39;t procreate anymore, but suddenly there&#39;s a knocked up hag who must give birth to her alien AT ALL COSTS!!! 
Who gives a flying fuck???

I suppose this is a post-apocalypse film for middle-class, conservative and conformist parents, for whom this &quot;no births&quot; issue surely would seem a nightmare.

Personally, I&#39;m only watching this because Michael Caine&#39;s in it.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ this trailer shows the movie from start to end :S
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI recently read the book that this movie is derived from and iv got to say that this is one of the instances were the film is better than the book.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitadude what are you 12 your so fucking ignorant go back to playing CoD
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThey talk about this in the movie, actually. It&#39;s pretty much just random luck (other than the symbolism of Africa as the origin of humanity) but part of the tension is that the far-right British government wouldn&#39;t accept an African refugee as the only fertile woman on Earth.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI cried at the end.....
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshita sid&#39;s gun when sid was holding them at gunpoint.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitathe rise of gay world
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaBest movie of all time. Seriously, the camera work itself is complete masterpiece.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitayes
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaone of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this in cinemas with my friend. What an absolutely fantastic movie.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI agree.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaSigur R√≥s - Hopp√≠polla
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaLow budget? Really? Do you have any clue how expensive it is to do a 7 minute take of a building being destroyed with hundreds of extras involved? For that matter, to do it MULTIPLE TIMES? Your opinion is your own and I respect it, but how could you call that low budget?

2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the music at 1:40 ? Thanks 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie, stunning atmosphere, horrible trailer
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThe bus terminal scene when she prays to St Gabriel and gets taken outside and bagged over the head to be slaughtered like the others is what should happen to the Republicans now that Bronco Bama won.  They need to be lined up and slaughtered and brought to a refugee death camp
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaHad guns, death and explosions, would&#39;ve thought he&#39;d love it..

2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitathat flick = loada multi-racialist NWO globalist intergrationalist propaganda bullshit.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThis movie have just one problem: it&#39;s too short, and have no sequence! Damn, I want a sequence!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshita..brilliant movie.. and Clive Owen doesn&#39;t touch one gun in the movie.. that&#39;s a real hero to me
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitalow budget!!! boring?! what???? may the movie gods have mercy upon your soul.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaGimme Shelter is the perfect music for this trailer.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitasigur r√≥s - hoppipolla
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThe best movie ever ....
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaGimme Shelter, The Rolling Stones (London Symphony Orchestra) 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaMichael Caine and Old man John Lennon 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThe scenes in this movies are damn long :0 &quot;Not using other angles&quot;
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaamazin movie, IMHO, the director of this movie is miles away better than oscar winner danny boyle, jus genius, the movie looked almost real to me, 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaHoppipolla by Sigur Ros
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m assuming you prefer Michael Bay&#39;s shit?
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWhats that song called around 1:50?? 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaBest. Movie. Ever.
EVER!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaHAHA IS THAT PREGNANT GIRL FROM 16 AND PREGNANT :0
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaDownload the movie from here!

2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWell, you could say it&#39;s a good film because people can enjoy it (Like I said it&#39;s well made and can set emotions astir), but my personal definition of a good film also includes an intelligent and well thought-out plot, which this movie in my opinion totally lacks of.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaPeople like you make me loose hope in the intellect of mankind each day...
You&#39;re so reliant on your instincts and feelings that when a subject of authority withholds even the tiniest bit of information you automatically assume the worst. Besides not even the worst because we could definitely use some population reduction right now, it would be good even. That&#39;s like a double fail man...
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaHow is it one of the best films ever made? Yes the acting and shooting was well made but this movie had one of the weakest plots I have ever seen. I mean humans suddenly can&#39;t procreate anymore? and why are there protests and violence?
The key points of the plot are just so loosely made up, one of the biggest disappointments I&#39;ve ever had with a film.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaAssuming the conditions of the premise of the movie, why would anyone resist letting that woman have her child?  I can&#39;t understand the stories that movies attempt to tell now a days.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI was thinking the same thing when I watched it last night, yet, its so different in it&#39;s art direction.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s some deep shit dude...
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitahow original... 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaYeah this is probably just a sign of things to come.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitawut! so you think you better watch twilight!? #(*&amp;!*&amp;$^%! 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitalow budget? wth?
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaPlaying Half-Life 2 will never be the same.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThere is too much emphasis on the whole baby part. The greatness of this film lies in something completely different.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaBad trailer is bad. Doesn&#39;t do justice to the movie.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaIts good I watch the movie first, and then trailer just to see how it was advertised, well if i watch the trailer first I wouldn&#39;t have to watch the movie. :)))   
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI cried at the end
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitais it only me or in the middle did you hear the soundtrack of resident evil?!??!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitathis movie is the Blade Runner of our generation.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThe first one sounds like a string arrangment of the rolling stones - gimme shelter, the second song is Hopipolla by Sigur Ros
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaplease explain how overpopulation is a myth. It makes no sense to try and believe the earth has enough resources to handles billions upon billions of more people  
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitabecause kee is an immigrant and they are not allowed in that place 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitai dont understand why everyone is trying to get her when all they want is a child anywayzz??
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaI know but I&#39;m pointing out that not everything is all doom and gloom with a low population growth rate.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWow you cannot compare Children Of Men to Transformers. Transformers 1 was a decent fun summer movie. But the rest was just mindless action. Children of Men is a great movie.
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaWell....not to offend anyone but we have to also consider that an increase in the global population is not without it&#39;s detriments. We have to accept that an increase in population will place further strain on our resource consumption. At the rate we&#39;re going, food stocks are going to dwindle and the freshwater supply will drop. Having to accommodate all these new people will require us to build more homes and amenities to cater to their needs and what happens? We start running out of land. 
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaLikes Transformers
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaThought provoking movie for sure...
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaMost underestimated movie of the decade, and its best! Love, just love this film!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaworst movie, very boring LOW BUDGET!!
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitaby your mother
2VT2apoX90odelimeterByIshitalast
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMy mom gave birth to me when she was 40 I have a whole bunch of medial issues, but they aren&#39;t really from age just bad luck. At least thats what I think
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWait,, is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnFaltqnAY&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a> June Moone or Emma Stone ?? LOL
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThese comments, eh? How easily we can spot who&#39;s suffering female relationship issues.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita1979! I&#39;m intrigued!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t you have to be a man to raise a man... yes
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitamore female empowering shit. everyday I hear and see this shit. I think we all get it now. your all strong and  independent.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the second song in this video
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaLOVED IT!!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitasaw it on a free screening, definatly a chick flick, was bored and wanted to walk out before the ending
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI heard about this film on NPR and I can tell all of you guys/gals out there that this is not a man hating feminist film. It&#39;s literally about the directors life and how his mother and the other woman in his life helped him become the man he is today.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaAll these comments prove to me that men really hate women. Anything that centers the female experience like this gets berated with comments like the ones under this video.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome. I can&#39;t wait to see it.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaSurprised about the hate in the comments section.   Honestly this being some &quot;feminist&quot; movie never crossed my mind watching the trailer.  I just see a movie with a good cast, late 70s setting and some cool Talking Heads and Buzzcocks songs.  It could very well be terrible or a feminist propaganda movie, but just judging from the trailer, I&#39;m intrigued.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMedia literacy: I wonder how much the tobacco industry paid to have the actresses smoke.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaYou can watch 20th Century Women Online here <a href="https://twitter.com/InfinityMov/status/808742769241882624">https://twitter.com/InfinityMov/status/808742769241882624</a>
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaPlease. No body know what is music from start??
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitathe cinematography and the production looks beautiful and so cool! i loved beginners..mind you it just seems like its about a specific kind of &quot;20th century woman&quot; (white) but it will be interesting to see..cant wait!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me the names of  and artist of the two songs in the trailer
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThese comments are despicable. Preparing to hate a film without putting real thought into your decision to post a comment about how bad this film looks, because it seems like it was made by a feminist. <br><br>What a pathetic lot of you. Why is feminism a bad thing? It&#39;s not! Sure, certain stances, and angles may be misguided, but feminism is a well-intentioned thing. This director found it necessary to tell a story of a teenager who lives this portion of his life surrounded by women. Women who may serve a respectable role, or guide in his young adulthood. That&#39;s great! It seems like a totally fresh angle, and given that it takes place in the late 70&#39;s, it&#39;ll probably serve some nostalgic purposes as well.<br><br>Yes, film critics will probably like this film... actually they already do. Did you ever stop to think that maybe that is because it is a legitimately good film? That&#39;s my bet. If you don&#39;t believe that, maybe research a little. And see what it is about the film that people seem to like.<br><br>Why must you always create a string of toxic, and meaningless comments that add nothing of value to the conversation. <br><br>Grow up.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaChrist I&#39;m no feminist but everyone needs to chill. this movie is triggering the shit out of everyone. seems bit hypocritical
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched both trailers 100+ plus times I can&#39;t wait till it comes out :)
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitalooks great!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so confused about everyone in the comments, why are y&#39;all so butthurt ? The movie looks fine, not amazing, but I&#39;d check it out. Definitely doesn&#39;t deserve all the shit it&#39;s getting, wtf
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWait a minute, the little guy has a dick too! <br>And he will probably think he will be helping when actually he would be doing nothing, or even  think it&#39;s preferable to have a father to raise a kid!!! <br><br>The power of the uterus compels him! The power of the uterus compels him!!!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaElle Fanning&#39;s hair does not look 70&#39;s at all. In 1979 most teenage girls wore their hair feathered with little wings or flip curls like Farrah. This is just a side parted do right out of 2015.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThe comments on this trailer shows that MRAs and the alt-right have taken over Youtube. Youtube is basically just 4Chan now.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMen will literally find anything to call &quot;stupid feminist propaganda&quot; no. It&#39;s not about hating men. It&#39;s about female empowerment. I haven&#39;t seen the movie, so I don&#39;t know the message...but I don&#39;t think really anyone has seen it yet. Judge it by the trailer. Fucking woman haters, more like it. God damn.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaoh look Feminist dribble that will end up in the $5 bin at your local Target.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWhy all the hate for this trailer huh? are the ghostbusters bros back at it again?<br>this looks like a great movie with THE ANNETTE BENING &amp; there&#39;s no blatant &quot;I hate men&quot; theme.<br>God this is just about a woman raising her child? what&#39;s wrong with that?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWow. look at all those movie around where women are being portrayed as a lust object without brains, where her value is portrayed as equal to the size of her boobs and/or butt rather than anything else, as some prize to be won, as someone who can be told what to do, as someone who can&#39;t do anything by herself, where men are always the heroes and women are always the victims... And then every once in a while some movie comes out where those notions are being questioned and/or criticized and just look at the downpour of MRA tears... Don&#39;t like your privileges questioned, do you guys?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita&quot;God SJW&#39;s these days get triggered over anything!&quot; <b>Releases movie trailer with women in lead role</b> &quot;REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaDid somebody post this to an MRA subreddit? Why the hell are all the comments a bunch of triggered dudes. This movie looks great. December can&#39;t come soon enough. And what does it say about you if you seek out a trailer for a movie you&#39;re not interested in just to post a negative comment? That you&#39;ve too much time on your hands and project your insecurities about changing social mores onto (really good) movie trailers you didn&#39;t even need to watch? Please let me know if I&#39;m wrong.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t understand the hate. For me this looks like a really lovely movie!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitalmao all the leafy fans who laugh @ triggered feminists and then have a fucking aneurysm over a 2 minute trailer bc &quot;t-t-he feminazis !11!&quot;
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a sad portrayal of the reality of single mothers who unconsciously blame their sons for their fathers behaviour. (***To be clear this is by NO MEANS most single mothers)
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita&quot;but, don&#39;t you need a man to raise a man?&quot;, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so&quot;...   now look at the current crop of &quot;men&quot;, weak milk toast safe space pansies.. I think she was wrong.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who actually liked this trailer ??? lol
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s safe to say you don&#39;t need a man to raise a man, you need a man to raise a manly man to help him cope with the feelings that women wouldn&#39;t understand.  Vice Versa.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaA new Mike Mills, I can&#39;t wait, one of the many films I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this movie season.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitatoo cringey
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s dick did the director have to suck to get this video featured?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaSmh, the women-hate in this comment section is ridiculous. Apparently you can&#39;t even make a movie with the word &quot;women&quot; in the title without accusations of having a &quot;feminazi&quot; agenda and triggering the egos of insecure dudes. I loved &quot;Beginners&quot;, can&#39;t wait for this one.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S A MOVIE WITH FEMALE LEADS UH OH IT MUST BE A MAN-HATING SJW CESSPOOL
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI already see a bunch of hipsters in line.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaanother movie with uninteresting white women that nobody asked for
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThis is that random movie that shows up in the Oscars for best costume design or something
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like type movie where random couples would just go in the theater caress each other
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaIm all for these types of film but it just PUSHING IT a bit to much with the whole women don&#39;t need men
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThe cringe.... it BURNS!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaUntill they are sinking on the titanic then its twisting their hair into pig tails and acting like a useless women who needs men to save them... &quot;women and children first!&quot; NOPE! THATS GONE! Today that wouldnt happen. There would be a riot and boats would be smashed and everyone would die. Because women want special treatment. I say use your hand til you find the right women who doesnt use men to get what they want. Find a women who WORKS and doesnt expect men to pay for them whether it be on a date at a dinner or their rent. Take your time men. Find the right person. Weak men ENABLE this entitled princess crap.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaKeep your hate speech off my campus!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaso any movie with lots of women is feminist to you trolls? I mean this is the same type of indie film as boyhood, what&#39;s wrong with it? if you&#39;re not going to see it just because it&#39;s feminist then don&#39;t. but literally there&#39;s no other valid critic that anyone&#39;s putting forward except: this has lots of women so it must be feminist so the liberal agenda is being shoved down our throats. Get over yourselves.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of the documentary I watched on garbage and landfills
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see our heroic male lead!

6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitathe second i saw this i knew there would be comments about The Evil Feminists taking over Hollywood
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMen? BOOOO!!! Women? YAAAY!!<br><br>ugh...
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite line in this movie, &quot;Don&#39;t you need a man to raise a man?&quot;,  followed by one of the most delusional lines ever.  &quot;No I don&#39;t think so.&quot;
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaGo Lucas :)
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita<b>L</b>
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita0mG mEn r sooOoo opprreesivee and awfulll UGH
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprised ellen page isnt in this.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaSo I started reading the comments here. Obviously, the childless, bitter and overreacting crowd got to see this trailer and vomit their silliness on to this comments section. <br><br>This great actress (Oscar winner) Annette Benning plays the mom, btw, is actually shelling out legit truths. Honestly.....<br><br>If you don&#39;t get it then, you still have a long way to go. I bid you a tough cranium.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI hope this makes 29 cents at the box office.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaOf all the interesting bits of the late 70s, this is what they go with?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWow such a diverse group of......hair colours for a film called 20th century women
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWill try to watch because of Elle Fanning
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason so many women hate men now is because the modern day man is so feminine, mentally weak, and lifeless. If men were real men and were responsible, self sacrificing, tough, masculine, confident, and didn&#39;t take shit, would women really be complaining? People think that modern day women prefer less masculine men who are not macho and can be easily dominated, even women think this sometimes. But this could&#39;t be further from the truth. It is the white male that is being attacked, not black men who are much more masculine and hence dominant (or everything a feminist seems to hate) than white men. If white men regained their masculinity everyone would be content (they would also be a lot tougher to pick on in the media).
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaHow much does it cost to make this trend
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaMost of the late 20th century women. Disgrace to humanity. <br>Most of their kids... Threat to humanity!!!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaAlmost as good as content from Ray Bayne.<br>ÔÅä
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitathe title of the movie should be &quot;I hate men&quot;
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaHahahaha
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitabilly crudup, you crazy som bitch
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaAnd sometimes no one shows up.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaGreta Gerwig is my future wife
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitayour first mistake was saying you didn&#39;t need a husband to help rsise your son. its statistically proven that children are better off with a mom and dad. <br><br>Jesus Christ the feminist bullshit is piled high and thick!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWhy does elle fanning always look like she was just crying?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it‚Äî why the hate? It&#39;s just some persons indie film probably about their single mom. It&#39;s just a fucking film. No ones forcing a matriarchy here.<br> It&#39;s probably a potential Oscar contender, so I&#39;m assuming why it&#39;s trending.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a movie mainly consisting of women.<br>Looks like we gotta trip the feminist scum alarm again
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita<b>video starts</b> The Simpsons......
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaIdk, to me this looks like it&#39;ll be a sleeper pick. I&#39;m going to see it
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitawould&#39;ve been better if the story traced the matriarchy in one family on the eve of Y2K all the way back to the early 1900s.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWhen I think of 20th century women, the 1950s golden era tyoe pops into my head. Not 1980s but whatever
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitathis movie is all a feminists nightmare, in the end she wakes up and decides to get an abortion.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaWhen you tube is so liberal that a video with less then 15,000 views is high on trending (above a vid with 1M views)....yah that&#39;s some BS and this might take place in the 20th century but sounds just like 2016 fake feminazi crap
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of some indie film you&#39;ve never seen; comes another movie you&#39;re gonna find in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart 3 years from now. Starring: An actress you&#39;ve never heard of, a girl who&#39;s related to someone kinda famous and a boy who couldn&#39;t act his way out of a wet bag. <b>Low Budget Movie with No Plot</b>: not coming to a theatre near you ever...
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch thsi
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaHmm this looks good
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita&gt;#20 on trending<br>&gt;26 comments
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a really good film.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaHow is this trending?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshita&quot;That&#39;s slightly off topic&quot; nobody talked like that in 1979
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaBully or terrorist? Golly chose the right choice,,,,chose the right choice can we really have a criminal rather than someone who hurts your feelings?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitathis feminist bullshit ass movie I hope this never go notice.. why I even bother.
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaJust give it to me now, A24!
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaHow beautiful!! Can&#39;t wait! What a wonderful cast and vision!! HM
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaSong that starts playing at :30?
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaLooooovely
6JnFaltqnAYdelimeterByIshitaOscar noms for Annette Bening for sure.....
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaApparently, it&#39;s part of the contract that once you appear in a Wes Anderson movie, you must appear in all future Wes Anderson movies.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaRalph Fiennes and Wes Anderson appear to be a match made in heaven, judging from this trailer!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaZum Teil gedreht im Kaufhaus G√∂rlitz und im Gef√§gnis Zittau! 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy, I can&#39;t wait to see this in theatre. Wes Anderson is one of my favorite director, and I thank him for making such beautiful movies.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitayou can almost taste Wes Anderson
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaPERFECT
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaYeah, what the hell?
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI really needed another Wes Anderson movie lately, this looks absolutely amazing. I can&#39;t wait! 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaLook who&#39;s using serifs in their titles now...! 
This looks lovely!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this film!!!!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSO QUIRKY
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson is my favourite film director!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitamarch 07
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaLove this. Looks so fun.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitahe says &quot;i&#39;ve had older&quot;
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Nnnmmm--I&#39;ve had older&quot;
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaAnother pretentious Wes Anderson film. I&#39;m looking forward to it.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita‚ÄúA few months after this conversation, the director shot his eighth feature, The Grand Budapest Hotel, in three different aspect ratios: 1.33, 1.85, and 2.35:1. The movie jumps through three time periods; the different aspect ratios tell viewers where they are in the timeline.‚Äù

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Mmm, I&#39;ve had older.&quot;
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve had olders.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWhat does Ralph say right after &quot;She was 84&quot;?  I&#39;ve listened to that line several times, and I can&#39;t even make it out as English.

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita:)

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaYes, but when is the premier? 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitatrailer&#39;s so beautiful. heart is still pounding like a phonebook in a dryer
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitawhy are most of the shots in 4:3?
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita–ø–µ–Ω–∏—Å
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaevery wes anderson thing is the most wes anderson thing in life though
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaMe watching this:

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI AM SO EXCITED!!! YES WES ANDERSON YES!! Also, Saoirse looks great in this!! WOWWWWIE
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaNo, just no. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Nope.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaHell yea
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaJerry Seinfeld.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI think anyone who would randomly read Youtube comments before going to bed will hang himself in despair Tim.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s actually filmed in 2.35 : 1 using 35mm film.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWow, did he film this in 4:3?
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSO QUIRKY XDDD
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaFILMED IN 4:3 - (To be said in the trailer voice usually reserved for 3D movies).
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaEverything he said +1 and +yoae yo yoae yo yo yoae yo yo and a wink Emoticon. 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaViiiiiiite ! ! ! ! ! ! ! A quand la sortie ? 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaThe film has been produced for the most part in G√∂rlitz!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaEr, mole, I mean. Most probably mole.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse Ronan sports a cool Mexico-shaped tattoo on her cheek! (min 1:52)
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI WANT TO SEE THIS NOW!! &gt;.&lt; Can&#39;t wait! 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaDid he actually film it in 4:3? Awesome.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaMy guess is that the shots of Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and F. Murray Abraham are situated in the present time. Not only are they the only widescreen shots. But look carefully at the styling. It has modern touches. For instance, the chairs behind F. Murray. The wall behind Schwartzman. And the ragged bathroom with Law. They certainly don&#39;t resemble the chiqueness from the old hotel. Also, we don&#39;t see these characters anywhere else in the trailer. These might be shots from a prologue film.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaNo big surprises cast wise :) No complaints here!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSamuel L Jackson.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaFYI - Wes would never meet any grown person who doesn&#39;t spell &quot;you&quot; in full.

Sincerely,
The Rest of the Internet
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWhy is 4:3 relation aspect, and sometimes is 16:9?
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI PRAY THERE&#39;S A BIRD&#39;S-EYE SHOT OF A HOTEL LEDGER!!! OMG
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWell,that was quirky. I still haven&#39;t watched any film by Wes Anderson,I probably should get to it.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWhat a cast!!!! Classic Wes Anderson
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaAy ay ay ay que emoci√≥n! felicidad!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita*SCREAMS* :D
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaname one actor who&#39;s not in this film
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaOh, this is going to be awesome. The trailer did more for me than some recent movies...
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaThe cast of this movie is flawless
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;s know it was him from the very first frame.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaVery cool.wes Anderson is the man.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaawesome
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaIf the trailer is 1:33:1, I can&#39;t imagine the movie being different. However, surprisingly there are 3 shots in 2:35:1.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita2.35:1 according to IMDB (as of time of comment).
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit yes. Very very yes.

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaha! did you not laugh once? or is it that you completely lack humour?
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaFUCKING AWESOME, as always...
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitais the film really going to be in 1.33:1 aspect ratio? that&#39;s old school, man. nice.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so funny! I can&#39;t wait until it hits theaters :)
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson &lt;3
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaAwesooommmmmmmmmm
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaLove the new aspect ratio. I wonder how it plays into the story.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaOutstanding
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson, bringing moustaches to the masses.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSaorise with a gnarly birthmark, awesome!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita0:56 

Lea Seydoux ?? as the maid
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI would watch this cast do anything but that this is made my Wes Anderson makes it such more fun.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitatheres a bunch of different aspect ratios at the end.  
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitalooks like a lot of style, now where&#39;s the substance
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaGood stuff!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaOh my God, already hooked. 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWes, I hope you randomly read Youtube comments before going to bed to see if people will like ur film. I just wanna say if u have any self doubt ever in ur life, u should know that u are one of the most talented creatives of our time. Somehow through ur work u capture that innermost emotion of joy, adventure and hope of our childhood that many of us have lost. 10/10 times after I watch one of your films when I feel lost or down, your work magically uplifts my spirit. I hope to one day meet u.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaSAOIRSEEEEEEEEEEE!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI cant believe its 4:3
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaEh, it looks ok.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so fantastic I&#39;m practically swooning. 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaDat cast o_O
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaHm...  Let me think about whether or not I&#39;ll see this over by that trampoline...

*Thinks by trampoline*

Yeah, I&#39;ll see it for sure.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI.am.so.EXCITED!!!!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita
 CAN&#39;T WAIT
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaAhhhh. Can&#39;t wait.

1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaWow.
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaOmggggg! I can&#39;t waiting for this! 
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!!!!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshita4:3!!!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaincredible!!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaYESYESYES
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaToo excited!
1Fg5iWmQjwkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this! Looks like Wes Anderson&#39;s best film yet!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaoh boy dis movie&#39;s gonna be crazy as hell...
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshita@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOW_azQbOjw&amp;t=0m29s">0:29</a> is that¬†Paula Patton&#39;s character being shot at point blank ??¬†
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitavery good
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaSounds like Jack Ryan Donaghy is synergizing backward overflow at the CIA by dissolving the IMF. 
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good. Like the music. Wish they&#39;d cast more than one woman per movie though.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaShiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet<br>I just hope it will be as good as the last one cause the last one was epic
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaDamn Cruise got some balls to film that plane scene legit without stunt doubles or CGI
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaso hopefully the last Mission :3
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/gOW_azQbOjw?t=1m19s">1:19</a> damn Jeremy looks old.. Tom still looks almost the same as before but his age is starting to slightly catch up to him
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it blended all of the previous movies into this one. I like it. I hope it turns out just as great as Ghost Protocol. Sooo much money will be made this year it&#39;s ridiculous. Next year might even be crazier.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaRebecca Ferguson is such a charismatic actress. Say whatever you want about Cruise, he is good at action movies.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a &quot;James Bond&quot; storyline - Bond has Specter, and Ethan has the Syndicate....
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaNo one fucks with Les Grossman.<br><br><br>DIET COKE!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitalooks sick. day one for me!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaMission Impossible over any bond movie!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is wonderful. Tom cruise is gorgeous as always in the role of Ethan hunt. WAITING WAITING WAITING!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaEpic return of Ethan hunt. Summer will be really hot. Fans of the franchise like !!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLooks good cannot wait to see it!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaTOM CRUISE IS LEGEND
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaBring back J.J.abrams to the franchise!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaSimply Breathtaking!! <br>One of the best films of the year!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaWas this part of your plan?
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaanother last mission
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait. Though it always seems like there&#39;s only 5 people working for the whole IMF.¬†
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaSeems like BMW¬†found another platform after James Bond 007¬†bailed out.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThe good old Tom.<br>glad he&#39;s back!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitacalling it now , that&#39;s tom cruise long lost sister
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaIt will be great:)
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaWait, is he the guy with the middle tooth? Because THATS special!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaYou had one Job Benji.. ONE JOB!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaBENJI GOT HIS MASK!<br>@geniusmoviemind for news on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jessicajones">#jessicajones</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23marvel">#marvel</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23exclusive">#exclusive</a>
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaPure insanity. We need more committed action stars like Tom.¬†
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitacruise still the best,i dont think younger actors will be able to pull out this one.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaI love Jeremy Renner than Tom Cruise....
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOW_azQbOjw&amp;t=2m18s">2:18</a>.¬† Shit just got real.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaYou can clearly tell Tom Cruise was having a blast hanging off the side of the plane. Hunt is obviously suppose to have a modicum of fear, but the dude can barely contain the excitement on his face.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s on the plane. Now what&#39;s the next step of his master plan?
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaTom Cruise is the best movie runner.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitawow Epic!!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaOh man ! <br>Ethan Hunt is back &amp; waaow - What a comeback !!<br>Spellbinding trailer.<br>Tom Cruise - You are just fab.<br>Great to see Luther &amp; Benji too<br>Last time it was Burj Khalifa, this time it&#39;s an airplane. This guy is extraordinary.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaI am SQUEALING with excitement for this movie!  Can&#39;t wait to see it! Tom Cruise, you&#39;ve done it again.  You&#39;ve managed to blow my mind with just a trailer!!  This looks like its going to be ANOTHER blockbuster and well deserved!  You are far underrated as an exceptional, versatile and well established  actor.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaPretty solid trailer overall. ¬†Rarely will I go to a movie JUST for one scene. ¬†But if that mid-flight plane scene is as good as I hope it will be, I will pay full price to see that.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitagetting more comedic, thanks to you simon.<br>dont know how to say about it, but ghost protocol was fun..<br><br>ahh, i forgot. bad robot &amp; star trek..
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaWOW!!!! HA-HA WOW!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThe other door!<br><br>LMAO. I can&#39;t wait to see this on the biggest screen possible.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be sure to watch in IMAX for that plane scene alone!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitathis should be the last one tom an vin are both agin they&#39;re gettin too old for all this, but it lookes dope ima watch it
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThe other door!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaMovie sponsored by BMW :D
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaThe small details like the plane stunt done by Tom Cruise makes this movie 10x better than unrealistic CGI
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaso british
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaI see BMW has paid for half the movie and that is awesome :)
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaDamn, and I was so excited that they were going to dissolve the International Monetary Fund.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand the hate Tom Cruise gets from some people. How many other actors would be willing to hang of the side of a plane... or the tallest building in the world? I&#39;d love his job personally (and his home life flying P-51d&#39;s ;) But I&#39;m thankful he&#39;s willing to go to such lengths, it means we get cool movies every now and then like this. And Oblivion not so long ago which was great.
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitai hope mib5 is one of the best film for TOM
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaTom Cruise + Mission Impossible = Freaking Cool......Waiting fr d movie :-)
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaTOM CRUISE IS THE BEST!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome¬†
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaTom Cruise was &quot;underrated&quot; in the last 5-6 years. People and media criticized him and his movies just because of his life. While he gave stellar films like Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, Jack Reacher, Valkyrie, and Ghost Protocol. 
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaActually Mission Impossible Released Date In 2015 ¬†Christmas But Tom cruise has scared because king khan badshah no 1 khan srk dilwale is coming In christmas so tom scaredly brought to the film into July Release<br>see haters even hollywood starts also scared srk<br>¬†<br>¬†  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KingKhanRocks">#KingKhanRocks</a>  ¬†
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaREADY OR NOT HERE I COME
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaLove Benji&#39;s homage to Troll 2! OH MY GOD!!!!!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshitaWith Ghost Protocol I wished Luther would be on the team. Now this is the ultimate IMF Team finally! I¬¥m excited!!
gOW_azQbOjwdelimeterByIshita300th person to watch it

-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThis shit look lame like that biggie movie watered down niggaz 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaHam!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaHsjsjwjo<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaOnce you get past the obviously bloated fairy tale portion of Ice Cube being &quot;from da streets&quot; this looks like a decent movie
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s all about CMW and NWA Compton&#39;s most wanted and nigga&#39;s with attitude CMW was first though in the 80&#39;s then nwa in the90&#39;s
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait<br>
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhat about mc Ren and yella 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI love N.W.A&#39;s &quot;Art&quot; and now they have a movie for it :3...
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaAnybody else get excited when they heard post tropical
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaits awesome!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the piano song in the backround <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F5WcFPDzko&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F5WcFPDzko&amp;t=1m60s">1:60</a>
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaFuck Yeah!

-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI understand why they&#39;re probably just going to focus on Eazy-E, Ice Cuba &amp; Dr. Dre and feature the MC Ren, DJ Yella and DOC as supporting characters, E, Cube and Dre created bigger legacies outside of the NWA, but I feel like they should have bigger roles.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWatching the video with my beats on&lt;3 M*thafucka
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the DOC?

-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThis eazy voice is way off when he sings boyz in the hood......And his voice is off all together 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhat was mc ren never in nwa wtf  no mention
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThat dosent look like dr dre&#39;s eyes
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI was NOT expecting this movie to look as amazing as it did. Very exited to see the final result.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaso excited!!can&#39;t wait to see this
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWHERE CAN I FIND THE PIANO VERSION?!?!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t even raised or like around should i say when NWA was booming. But i saw this trailer when i went to see Furious 7 &amp; I CAN&#39;T wait... &#39;&#39;CRUSIN&#39; DOWN THE STREET IN MY SIX FOE&#39;&#39;¬†
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaDo they have the music from these trailer out and no not the original sounds track.i mean the one from these trailer.

-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhere are MC Ren and Yella ?
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaFucking cops man.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaits by time!!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaEAZY EEEEEEE MDFK!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaYo ain&#39;t easy-e from gta San Andreas ? Idk I might be wrong 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaNWA Fan Fo&#39; Life....I can&#39;t fucking wait until this movie comes out....
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaFuck Tupac bring back eazy
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitamy nigga!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitanice, tupac next lol<br>cant help it
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so good
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaso excited u do not understand¬†
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaOk; I have to go watch this movie.... I swear this could be the shit.......
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaMy life is complete. ¬†This movie is perfect.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is gonna be so raw
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaOH SHIT
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaYet look at Ice Cube now, what a clown, it&#39;s over now.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is gonna be awesome
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI just want to know who directed this movie? Was it Dr.Dre or Jimmy Lovine.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitathis some fake ass corporate bullshit. ¬†everything NWA were, this movie is not.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s REN!!!! He wrote most of eazy first album which open the door for nwa.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI barely need to watch this cause I know every thing about it
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaHopefully this not becomes a dre, cube,  eazy movie. DJ Yella, MC Ren also were part of n.w.a., the D.O.C. also worked alot with them, but from what it looks like they don&#39;t even mention the Arabian Prince as well.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaDeal with it!! Korean Hip-Hop Punks!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI could either see fast 7 or NWA I chose NWA
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThey should&#39;ve have used lil Eazy to play Eazy E, it&#39;s only fair if they used ice cube son to portray him
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaif Hollywood get its hands on it its 50/50 B.S. and truth. Everybody putting cut in the work these days. Nuthin real
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWhERE IS MC REN???<br><br>OR MY NIGGA DJ YELLA<br>THEY&#39;RE FIVE MEMBERS OF NWA<br><br>ONLY THREE GOT REALLY BIG BUT STILL
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaAnd ¬†to ¬†the people in ¬†M√©xico waht !!?? ..... ¬†:(
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitahell yeah
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaOh shit Eazy vs Suge Knight 
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaIce Cube was the man. I don&#39;t care if he makes a thousand shitty kids films nowadays. He was still the man *.<br>* (Even if rap itself was invented by Bowie in 1979).
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaNWA 4 ever!!!... To be honest: PUBLIC ENEMY was the most dangerous group, for real -- but, we&#39;ll never see a PE movie... If NWA was a real threat for The System, they would NOT allow this kinda movie to be made. Think &#39;bout it.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t fucking wait
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaWithout eazy nwa wouldn&#39;t be around nor would dre nor would cube nor would snoop nor would eminem nor would death row nor would 2Pac, just cause he eazy didn&#39;t write his music while in NWA doesnt mean he was shit. He had a great voice and was a natural rapper once he got the hang of it.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaLookin&#39; like you did NWA&#39;s story justice and didn&#39;t slack off just to make money off them. Still, If it&#39;s not rated &quot;R&quot; I&#39;m not going to see it b/c their story was not PG-13 or less. We&#39;ll see.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaJizz in my pants
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaYEAAAAH!!!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaReal shit loving everything i have seen...but where is ren? Yella? D.o.c.?
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaHoepfully I see dr dre as a dancer, and ice cube writing boyz n the hood. If they gone be real be all the way real.
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaGet your Raiders hats!!!!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaand mc ren??
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI wish Eazy was here to put his input into the movie and not his fucking widow Tomica.  üòí
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitashit looks dope!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshita&quot;Our art is a reflection of our reality&quot;
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitasure i not gonna take my wallet on the theater to watch this movie, what could go wrong without it<br>* bang bang bang * dead
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshita–ñ–¥–µ–º!!!!!!
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaFurious 7
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaI dont see no Dre or ice cube
-F5WcFPDzkodelimeterByIshitaThe movie willbe dope......BUT WAT BOUT ARABIAN PRINCE?

ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitasomewhere deep (dj rapist and Dj Venomous Extended Mix)
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaWHY IS IT R RATED!!!???? AGHH I HATE THIS. ITS HARD BEING A TEENAGER..

ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaGoddammmm! Gonna see this one!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaHey peeps sorry for this comment not having anything to do with the vid but i have some incredible news. Did you know you could get anything from Amazon for absolutely nothing!? I kid you not. There&#39;s a site you can go to get any product from Amazon without paying a dime!. That includes anything from any category including Gift cards.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitahopefully its not another tammy
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaÿ±Ÿàÿßÿ¶ÿπ
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaNawt the cah, I, was awn fiyah. 
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitawent to the pre screening, FUNNY AF&lt; HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!! Great work FOX
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitawhy did the scooter have no roof then a roof?
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI think they&#39;re putting too much thought into these movie titles.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a funny movie. This over-weight woman is like a feminine version of that over-weight man in Anger Management. Sorry, I don&#39;t know their names...
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitagreat cast
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! I dont say that about many movies these days..
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitanot the car i was on fire
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaeurghh, hate this actress.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what to expect.<br><br>But it&#39;s got Miranda and Jason Statham in it - so anything could happen.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaGot see this one.. looks funny!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t stand Melissa McCarthy bit ill see this for Jason
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitamiss Jude Law...
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitathis look very funny.. but i think they just put all the jokes on the trailer
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks honestly extremely funny!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaU gonna cry. Lololololololol.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaMiranda!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaMe and my friend jay always joke around saying when we join the military when we run out of ammo we would just throw the gun at the bad guys and then I saw this and lost it
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI saw this in a add... i need to see this, it&#39;s hilarious xD¬†
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI so want to see this movie. It looks cool. I think she is full figured and beautiful.¬†<br><br>Personally, I think too many &#39;spy&#39; movies have the spy look too much like he does not belong driving cars that stand out. A real spy needs to blend in so they won&#39;t be noticed.¬†
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaWouldn&#39;t it have been better to just make Get Smart 2?
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaC&#39;est coooool
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI dnt know who that blue shirt woman is but she looks like a poorly CGI character from a game
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaIs that Nargis Fakri in green
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaWas going to watch it but... it&#39;s rated R not PG-13. :(
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks really good
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaWhat Song is that in this trailer? I heard Busta rhymes and became interested in the song, and this movie looks good
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshita&quot; GET YOUR HANDS OF MY BOOBS!&quot; Omfg I never laughed harder
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaLet me check my watch.  It&#39;s been eight hours, time for a new Melissa McCarthy movie.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshita$55,000,000 at box office<br>38% on Rotten Tomatoes
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaAmerican movies aren&#39;t funny!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks hilarious
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaCagney and Lacey ... rip out both your Swedish Meatballs.... ¬† R ¬† O ¬† F ¬† L !!!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitathis looks epic
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaGet smart 2?
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaWILL NOT SEE
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaOmg I love her!!!!!! Just wetting my palate! Lol!!!!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaThis is the same as get smart
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaJust when I start thinking Melissa&#39;s schtick has overstayed it&#39;s welcome suddenly she starts making me laugh again.¬† Those Italians in the car had me LMFAO.¬† OK, maybe I shouldn&#39;t be dreading the new Ghosterbusters flick.¬† We&#39;ll see.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally the same plot as get smart.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaOh my gods, I just love her!! 
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitanever was a big melissa mccarthy fan but this looks genuinely funny
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaLet me guess, jude law is the bad guy.

ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI genuinely want to see this. Funny, creative, new ¬†and talks about societal messages.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Did he also make you dress like a slutty dolphin trainer?&quot;
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaMelissa McCarthy as the C.I.A.&#39;s top secret weapon against terrorists.....................Yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Slutty dolphin trainer&quot; actually made me laugh, hahaha.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaHad me at Alison Janney, lost me at Miranda Hart. She is whatever the opposite of funny is. Like unfunny, but worse
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham :)
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaMelissa McCarthy is good¬†
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaLol you cry enough :D
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI laughed :D can&#39;t wait!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaIt seems really funny!
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaA better name would be Typecast: A Melissa McCarthy Tale.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaMelissa McCarthy can do no wrong.
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaCan you say get smart?
ltijEmlyqlgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited for this. I love this already. &lt;3

tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaYears after watching this movie I&#39;m finally actually seeing the trailer.
tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaMoral of the movie: Don&#39;t drink too much unless you can hold your booze.
tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaWtf, this trailer spoils almost every big moment in the movie, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t watch trailers! (I just watched the movie then the trailer)
tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitacopied from Bollywood
tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaIf you guys like this, you&#39;ll LOVE the first person hangover series of shortfilms by Dylan h vlogs, but don&#39;t be put of by watching 1 and 2, they&#39;re very old and pretty cringy, but the rest are amazing! (Maybe sub him while you&#39;re there.) (and me.) üòâ

tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaMy mom hates these kinds of movies with people getting drunk and being all gross and stupid cos she&#39;s all proper and well-mannered, so if even a person like that could find THIS movie hilarious, then you know it just IS. LOL

tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaI love this over movie,but are the sequels The Hangover part II and The hangover part III as good and funny as this one? I would like to hear other peoples opinions.
tcdUhdOlz9MdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is my favorite out of the three. So hilarious!

w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaMay 30th cannot come soon enough!!! I&#39;m SO stoked to see this movie!! Maleficient is only the best villain EVER!! I cannot contain my excitement!!! üòÅ
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitai just broke the replay button!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitathis trailer looks amazing, will make sure to watch it when it comes out¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaLove*
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this movie. Lost the cast :)
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaThe original curse is much better, in my opinion. Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. More dramatic... Oh well.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaIf not Angelina Jolie, who else could POSSIBLY be Malificent? No one, there was no other choice, she is perfect for this movie.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaThis is just gonna be EPIC!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=1m54s">1:54</a>¬† Holy Jesus Mary and Joseph!¬† Did the crow Diablo just turn into a freaking dragon?!¬† That, is, AWSOME!!:D
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaYASSSSSSSSSSSS OMFG YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaMaybe it&#39;s the stuff I&#39;m on, but I love this. &gt;.&gt;
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCant wait!!!!!!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDO WANT
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitathis looks AMAZING
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDoes she say &quot;Is it true mama?&quot; ?!?!?!?!?!<br>NEED TO KNOW !
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaThose cheekbones could kill a man.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI always thought the reason she didn&#39;t have wings is because she teleports.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a> it should hurt!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI NEED THIS MOVIE IN MY LIFE, NOW!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitabest¬†villain ever, i want her to kill everyone¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAhahaha, finally more dragons in the Maleficent trailer! She&#39;s always been my favorite villain specifically because she turns into a dragon, but the previous trailers were strangely missing this part. I&#39;m now officially hoping this doesn&#39;t suck.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitawooden balrog
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> there is &quot;she will fall into a sleep-like death&quot;. Wasn&#39;t it supposed to be &quot;she will fall into a death-like sleep&quot; (otherwise it doesn&#39;t make sense)?
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI heard that in the movie, Maleficent&#39;s raven is capable to assume forms of other creatures as well.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDRAGON! Ok where&#39;s my KEYBLADE? I&#39;ll also have Mickey, the sorcerer&#39;s apprentice fight on my side as well. Yesss! :D
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDis gone be goooood!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=0m24s">0:24</a> GET OUT!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=0m24s">0:24</a> swatting basic bitches to the side¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!! I was so scared of Maleficent that I would cover my eyes whenever she showed up.  Angelina makes the character easier to look at &amp; human.  Stunning looking!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaWonderful!! Magnificent!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitawaiting to see prince Phillip
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaWait wait wait! I&#39;m so confused. So is this a prequel to Sleeping Beauty? Maybe even a midquel? 
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-XO4XiRop0&amp;t=01m46s">01:46</a> sauron is that you?
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI am so sick of this trend of trying to make villains the hero. Maleficent was an amazing character on her own and now they&#39;re making this mess. So pathetic.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI have only a single gripe: the dragonfire should&#39;ve been green. That&#39;s what shook me up as a kid.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI live the trailer but WTF?! Why does Diablo (her raven) turn into a dragon?! And it annoys me because it is probably THE dragon. Does Diablo also become a raven from a human at one point in this trailer? I&#39;m so confused!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaOh shittttttt !!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitacada trailer k ponen me dejan kn ganas de ver +!!:)
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAMAZING &lt;3
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie, it will be one of the best this year!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDragons not big enough!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like who they casted as Aurora :/ I get that she has that youthful appearance, but just.. meh. She looks too made up, I guess. But I think Jolie is just STUNNING as Malecifent! 
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaLooking forward to watch on my birthday!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAngelina looks so stunning the pale skin, the red lips, the dress wonderful can&#39;t wait to see this!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaSo her crow is the Dragon. Cool.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaOk this looks good.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDamn gorgeous!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaOMG AMAZING!!! CAN&#39;T WAIT ANY LONGER!!!!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this!!! :D
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the background music in the trailer?
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaTHIS IS SO EPIC. CAN&#39;T WAIT! &lt;3
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaDamn. I shouldn&#39;t have watched this - it showed a lot.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita	<br>Sharlto Copley as a villain? I&#39;M DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS SHIT!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaIve read somewhere that during the midieval times, everyone,good or evil, should be invited to a christening (i forgot why sorry), and the king and queen didnt invite Maleficent. Maleficent knew about this and goes to Aurora&#39;s christening. Instead of letting her stay, the King and queen disrespected her and asked her to leave. And this results in Maleficent casting a bad curse.. i think.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait OMF
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitacan the movie come out now please
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaThe boy turned into a crow and the crow into a dragon...something&#39;s is weird....I can&#39;t wait to see this movie 
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitawait... did the raven turn into a Dragon?
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitacan¬¥t wait for this masterpiece ¬†!!!!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAnsioso demais e sairei do cinema saltitando e feliz =)
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitawhy are dragons in movies always Wyverns. I can only think of two movies where they wernt..Dragonheart and Eragon.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaO M G
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitathey chose perfect person to play Maleficent!<br>I am so hyped!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaSO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE! omg! haha
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitathis one felt a little off, i didn&#39;t like how she yell at everyone of how aurora is gonna die. and hopefully that wasn&#39;t the dragon form because even the animation felt more darker than this one.¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t Wait!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaso the crow is the dragon....this trailer ruined it for me. I expected changes but not a complete undoing of everything that made Maleficent the best villain in Disney films.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaoh joy joy joy she turns into a dragon!!!!!¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaOMG!!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!!! ¬†ToTaLLy AwEsOmE!!!!¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAngelina is soooooo Beautiful in her Maleficent role, those eyes, and those lips, I&#39;m in love with her now !!!!!!!!!<br>¬†:P¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaplease let her go full evil full villain i dont care if you redeemed her at the end and please show her dragon form-transformation if done right could be fantastic but PLEASE DON&#39;T MAKE HER MISUNDERSTOOD MAKE HER EVIL AS SHE WAS¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaoh man i like this i like this alot
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaabsolutely amazing. good job disney, judging from trailers
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaYou know the tale now find out the truth. Watch the new  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Maleficent">#Maleficent</a>  trailer now.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaSo... in this version, Maleficent cast the sleeping-curse DIRECTLY rather than trying to kill her?<br>THAT raises some interesting possibilities...
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaHoly epic crap. Angelina Jolie.. You never cease to amaze me. This movie is going to be SO EPIC. 
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaepiccccccc
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAmazing. I can&#39;t WAIT for this movie, I swear the suspense is killing me.¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like the fact that she had wings..like really..was she a fairy? nevertheless, it looks amazing!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaReally looking forward to watch the movie!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaWhy does it look like she is a crow first before she transforms into the dragon at the very end? I really hope that is her and that she doesn&#39;t send the crow in and transform him into a dragon instead.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaI think my heart just stopped....can time go any faster!!!!!! I must see this movie!!!!!!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaOmg, Angie is sooo perfect for Maleficent. Chills.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCAN&#39;T WAIT OH MY GOD 
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaWow. Can&#39;t wait for it to come out in¬†cinema&#39;s.
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshita&quot;She will fall into a sleep-like death&quot;? You all need to stop. It&#39;s &quot;She will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel... AND DIE&quot;¬†
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaAwesome! Awwsommee! Awwsoommmmee!! :&gt;
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaThe shots where she&#39;s soaring past the waterfalls and over the sea is so stunning! And I&#39;m liking the design of the dragon, very cool :)
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaCant wait for the movie!! But this trailer wasn&#39;t good like the &quot;Dream&quot; one
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaGreat new trailer for Maleficent!
w-XO4XiRop0delimeterByIshitaYes she turns into the dragon!!!!!

AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaWaah i miss this. I just came here because of tiktok
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaits a long tiem since i saw this movie i really dont understand what is the story
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaGiving me Coraline vibes.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaIt has been idk how  many years since I‚Äôve seen that movie and it was lit‚Äî
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitatropic thunder trailer ???????????????????????
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI wanted to see this, but after watching the trailer I&#39;m not really feeling it anymore üòî it was recommended by a friend, so most likely she will still force me to watch it anyway
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Pan&#39;s labyrinth&quot;(2006) has an excellent compination between fairy tale and war drama movie! The music is a magical lullaby!
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôm scared to watch this movie:(
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite movie. I love it
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaSi est√°s buscando un comentario en espa√±ol para ver si la pel√≠cula es buena! Te lo digo es una troya de pel√≠cula buen√≠sima conmovedora que m√°s se podr√≠a esperar de Guillermo del toro! cada pel√≠cula que veo de este productor me quedo fascinada con su talento!     Una ni√±a inocente que en el mundo de dolor que vive, se crea un mundo ficticio!!üò¢üò¢üò¢que final! me hizo llorar üò¢
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated movie
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaGrowing up on this movie ü§ù‚úäüèΩ
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThat monster must have exceptional hand-eye coordination
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading the book atm and <b>its so good so far</b> I can&#39;t wait to see the movie!!!!!!
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaWorst trailer for a beautiful film
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI remember this movie terrified me when I was a kid, and considered this as a horror film. Faeries were different from what I was used to, especially the pan when I believed that fauns should be as handsome as Mr. Tumnus.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is terrifying,i couldn&#39;t watch it till the end
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaCuaron-Gonzalez I√±arritu-Del Toro, la tercia de la muerte
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaShe looks like Eleven from Stranger Things. Coincidentally the actress playing Olefia debuted in 2004, and Millie Bobby Brown was born in 2004.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI like when trailers do not give away the movie too much. This is a 10 star movie, with big bold short English subtitles anyone can read easily.. Oh and TV-14 needs to be R rating, so parents know!
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaHer mother looks the same as her mortal mother. Does it mean that the queen too died in their dimension?
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshita2006
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaShould I watch it ? Im easily paranoid by scary and creepy things....
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI don‚Äôt know if I should watch this movie!!!! Trailer, kinda lame
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaWAS I THE ONLY ONE TERRIFIED OF THIS MOVIE GROWING UP WTF
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaOh shet
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaBi t√ºrk ben miyim
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie everüëéüëéüëéüëé
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitacan someone tell if this movie is worth it to watch?
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaYo I didn‚Äôt watch this movie for years because the trailer seemed meh but damn I watch this last night and it was amazing
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI came here because it&#39;s Ivana Baquero
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThe music is spellbinding almost as if it holds you in it&#39;s arms
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a younger version of Alessia Cara
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitai rewatch this movie now and wow the faun is WAY scarier than the pale man
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaHonestly all this movie had was one good character design, the pale man. Other than that the movie is a generic dark fantasy. Del torro is overrated for sure. Shape of water was also lacking. Scary stories to tell in the dark has better creatures designs, del toro help there but they weren‚Äôt his.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI remember when I was at my aunt and uncles house and my cousin put this on. I had no idea what was going on, but I remember I used to have nightmares about the creature with the eyes in its hands...I need to rewatch this movieüòÇ
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie in the world
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaMan, I remember watching this as a kid and having no idea what was going on
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaIdk I think Jerome&#39;s kinda hot ngl
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitasubtitled
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is in another language and it sucks. The End. That‚Äôs all i gotta day.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshita@paypaboyy
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this whole thing to find out that the faun isn‚Äôt even Pan they gave the English version the name Pans Labirynth but the faun is just a faun
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie tremendously
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI came here because of Paleman.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaYu
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaYu
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is one of my favorites and will be forever in my heart
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaWhy are all these comments so recent lmao
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaOkay but like this trailer does not match the movie whatsoever :/ the movie is much more than this
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI just wanted to find a good war movie
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie but it‚Äôs so depressing.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshita‚ÄúIN A TIME, WHEN MOVIE TRAILERS WERE NARRATED BY THIS GUY, AND THE TRAILERS KINDA SUCKED‚Äù
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI came here because of Gfriend
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was going to be darker.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is more then this stupid trailer i love this movie and i am really sure you will be in love too ..it reminds you of the fairy mind ..your fairy life you always had..‚ú®üí≠

AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaI always wondered whether Guillermo del Toro was inspired by The Spirit of The Beehive.
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaüåπüëç
AcHasH-nLhUdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie worth watching guys?
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song??

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks good bur ro bad its not in english :[
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaCould it really be that bad? Not all Americans like reading subtitles 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaThis really looks like a good movie, despite the subtitles. 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaFor the music it&#39;s : &#39;Red lights&#39; (by Vib Gyor) 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be watching this. Great to see an intelligent, warm and funny film that touches on the human soul, instead of mindless violence and special effects
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AMAZING!!! 

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaoh man im high as a kite right now and cannot stop laughing!! thats so fuckin funny

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awesome
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaROFLMAO
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaHow long till they make a shitty American remake?
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaBEST F*CKING FILM! I&#39;m from germany and it was a huge success there too! It is indeed really awesome. The message of this movie is so right and afterwards you feel great. Give it a chance!
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a fantastic movie! hope it&#39;ll come around here so i can see it!
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaGod damn French actualy pulled one off
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaIf that man could walk this would be broke back mountain 2
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaSeriously, guys. I&#39;m from France, and this film has had a huge succes here. 
It&#39;ll make you laugh to death and then cry :)
It really is a great film (and that&#39;s saying something, cuz the French cinema rarely has pearls like this).

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitabromance is awesome
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a true story, actually. Spectacular film.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitadamn only watching the trailer and im already crying
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaThat movie was a massive success at the french box office with 18 million viewers so far. It has heart, soul, laughter, tears. And the time I went to see the movie at the end all the people went out of the theater with smiling faces. Do not hesitate it&#39;s totally worth the money.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitawatched it in quality dvd on movies 25 great film
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitathink i might like this. and how does this look gay for all those people. a guy looking after another guy, what&#39;s wrong with that? 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaknightwolfpk your kind of gay. 

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaLooks kinda gay.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaBest Trailer I&#39;ve seen this month! Worth the money!
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitawow nice story
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaTr√®s bon film.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaFrench movie FTW ! 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaSo cool!!!! French cinema rocks!!!
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaI 100% believe this movie will be the winner of the Oscar Awards next year 2013 in the foreign categories, so real and so many emotional emotions in this french movie .........  
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m soo gonna watch this!!!!!!
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaOh okay, didn&#39;t know under its spanish name.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaThere is no fucking trend (or trend analysis), it is just a number. (Ratings are that easy, the number you get is the number of people who watch, if you have the biggest one, you&#39;re the most watched)
You&#39;re calling French people arrogant and pompous while you refuse to acknowledge a fact even though I put it right in front of you.
And then you talk about generalization and then call all frenchmen arrogant and shallow.
Camino de santiago is in Chile.
You&#39;re all kind of stupid.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshita2011 please!!!! 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaName of the song please

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaTV.com has the most up to date statistical data concerning trend and trend analysis. Transformers? No, I feel any Michael Bay film is complete trash and a utter waste of time, but thanks for the generalization and subtle ad-hominem. Kinda keying into that pomposity component now aren&#39;t we? I&#39;ve spent quite a lot of time in France, most recently on the Camino de Santiago. Are all Frenchmen assholes? Most certainly not, however, some seem intent on pushing buttons.

Bonne soiree
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny because I&#39;ve got an article from EW.com called Most watched shows on basic cable that puts the Jersey Shore on the top spot.
You&#39;re clearly amongst those people that believe transformers is the best movie of the decade and finds too hard to read subtitles while watching a movie so i&#39;ll give you a pass on not being able to use google properly.
I also find it quite funny when americans call french people arrogant, talk about double standards.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s completely obvious that you entirely failed to see the point. It was that snippet at the end, just in case you missed it. Regardless though, you&#39;ve certainly proven my point for me with this previous comment. For your edification, Jersey Shore is currently listed at #237 most watched programs. That would be 236 times removed from the &quot;most watched program on cable&quot; as you put it.

The internet doesn&#39;t make you stupid. It just makes your stupidity more accessible to others. 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitalmao @ 0:58
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaYou clearly know a lot about France and the European culture to call Frenchmen shallow. Coming from the country where a tv show like the jersey shore is the most watched program on cable.
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaExcellent film! Thoroughly enjoyed it. 
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad I love reading this should b a great movie
34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshitahey america,

everybody hates you because of this type of comments:
- I wish it was in english
- fuck subtitles

Is it so hard to enjoy something in a different language ? 
You do learn to read in school, don&#39;t you ?

34WIbmXkewUdelimeterByIshita&gt;:)^_^
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshita10/10 for this masterpiece
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaMy dad had psychosis.. his guidance was weird.. twisted &amp; paranoid but he believed it.. so I&#39;m not surprised by this trailer.. it can happen to your family
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaThis is a horror movie but I was cracking up laughing the entire time.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshita&quot;Are you disgusted?&quot;<br>&quot;No&quot;<br>God I love this film
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaI noticed a lot of these foreign movies are stuuuupid.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaStupid movie. Don&#39;t waste your time. The horror is watching this. No real ending either.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaFor me this movie says a lot of things. It&#39;s about the impossibility to control natural instincts and even social potential of the human being, it says something about social bubbles in modern society how that can turn people really insane and manipulable moreover it says something about how you are consequence of your means then you don&#39;t do X or Y stuff because you like or want to ONLY but because you was modeled to do so.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most disappointing movie I&#39;ve ever seen, i do not recommend it üò≥
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshita4 stars is sacrilege
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaAnyone here after The Favourite and The Lobster?
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitagreat movie and the metaphor with training dogs.. and ideas, like the one with small airplanes tossed/felt down :)).. the good and bad and the perception of reality means, unfortunately, still for different people different things.. bizarre tragedy, which almost make you laugh and then superb ending: smashed ‚Äòdogtooth‚Äô and trunk, the girl never got out of.. this scene, like the whole movie, will stay with you forever, like the dog bite, you‚Äôd never forget.. 5‚≠êÔ∏è
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitathis film is fucking crazy
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaYou know foster parents in the US actually do this? This director is brilliant. Shot out to Brenda Murchison and Patrick. They are foster parents who do this.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaSeems weird but literally the same happens in human societies across the world.. All are given wrong definitions about everything since childhood. All controlling each other to create better, uniform humans in vain.. Actual growth happens with own wisdom. The mind will eventually realize the worthlessness of fantasies and move towards emptiness by choice. The parents or societies don&#39;t need to insist emptiness..
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaThis was even funnier than Terribly Happy or Tatie Danielle.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaThe character of the parents is portrayed so to symbolise the blind truths that govern our world and our species. And *******SPOILER ALERT*******, in the end when the girl escapes when she realises the truth is shown to have an abstract ending, her future uncertain and unknown.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaWhen l first saw ‚ÄúThe killing of a sacred deer‚Äù , l thought it was weird and then l saw this movie, which is way more wierd than the former.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaYou know it&#39;s a Greek movie when domestic abuse is prominently displayed in the trailer
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitawhat the bloody hell..
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaGood movie. Extra weird.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitai‚Äôm honestly underwhelmed, most of the interesting parts were shown in the trailer and the rest 70% of the movie is pretty slow and bland. if u ACTUALLY wanna watch something weird, try SKINS (spanish)
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitabruh 75% of this movie is about incest
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitathe kids are us the ppl, and the parents are the rich bank owner whos control the world. ... keep us stupid, no morals, and give us stimulation
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaThis movie gave me fleas.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaok
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaInteresting documentary about home schooling.
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaAnd now, the award for the most bizarre movie of the year goes to........
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaonly here bc jake said it was one of his favorite movies üßê
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaWhats going on in here?
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaGood family shit. Pop this sumbitch in the vcr on thanksgiving!
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaYorgos lathimos is crazy person but one of my favourite
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaTrailer molto pi√π onesto e veritiero rispetto a quello della distribuzione italiana del film
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitawhat in the hell...
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitait was about as &#39;wtf&#39; as the movie Gummo.  ;)
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaDef a cool movie
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaJust tell me, when will  Lanthimos make a shitty movie? Never
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitathis is real! kim jong un invented it
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaWeirdest film I have ever seen. Loved it!
yQdjxQN4iegdelimeterByIshitaLucky guard to be paid to have sex with a younger man. Too bad she got hit by a vcr lol.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitarihanna the best

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitagood movie trailer
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitagood movie
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaAnyone think that this is a rip off from Transformers 3?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaIts always USA and american cities that get attacked first ==
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaIs that rianna at 24seconds in
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaSupermodels Vs Aliens.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaHOW IS IT ASIAN CITIES ALWAYS GET HIT FIRST!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaIndependence Day comes to mind when watching this trailer.....anyway, these aliens are pissing about with time-waster spinning razor balls?  A few tactical nukes should show them whose boss and have &#39;em phoning home like E.T. for emergency evac.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the music in the trailer ???
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitamore fucking Transformers shit by ANOTHER name. Not a shitting ORIGINAL design coming out of Hollyfucks these days. All the shit LOOKS the same. And based off a FUCKING boardgame too. Hollyfuck NEEDS  to burn.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll only watch it for Sir Liam Neeson
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaILM was definitely working on this during, if not right after Dark of the Moon.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita0:10 um excuse me sir but that is no &quot;it&quot; that is Issac Clark!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaHooyah Navy!

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaboom, we&#39;re not going down without a fight, did Shakespeare right this amazing dialogue (sarcasm).
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaat least the aliens don&#39;t have gay force fields.......
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitasomething isn&#39;t right, I can&#39;t find Michael Bays name attached to this anywhere. He must be using a disguise, he is a crafty bugger like that.  
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThose aliens look so kool &amp; badass that you wish they&#39;d win. But they&#39;ll lose again. I&#39;m beginning to feel sort of heartbroken about kool aliens always losing. 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitawho is that guy 1:03? this is frustrating, where I know him from? Reminds me of Armageddon/Independence Day?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitait has giant robots, explosions, and is related to aliens. TYPICAL MOVIE IN 2012
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaamazing 

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitathere are so many massive budget films coming out this year: Battleship,The dark knight rises=AWESOME,total recall,Men in black 3,wrath of the titans and The Avengers. I&#39;m hoping to see most of them...
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@ispark1000 Rihanna getting punched in the face? Chris brown gives this movie 11/10
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaX_X whoa, I&#39;ve been playing the game wrong......
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@nriab23 There is still one remaining reason. To hear Liam Neeson yell, dramatically, &quot;YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP!!&quot;
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaBoy this looks more loud than Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitais that a frikin&#39; salarian ?? :))....Oh yes why is  Rihanna in the movie ...Jeez we need to see good actors not Rihanna and Timberlake...Gone are the days when acting really was about acting not pretty faces ...I hope she has a secondary role. I hope Liam Neeson gets more attention than that singer because he is a good actor 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI wear that blue digital camo on a daily baisis, so its nice to see it in a movie.  HooYaa, Navy!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@Jimbob66DD probably liam neeson 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it will be a decent film,lets hope its not TOO much like transformers (even though i loved the films) :)
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@CanadianGamer420  umm no he wasnt mate.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song at 1:05 ?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitawhy is rihanna in the movie?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@nriab23 TRUST ME, my father was set designer on this film and this trailer reveals NOTHING!!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaTransformers meet water....
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI love how they showed none of Rihanna&#39;s inevitably horrendous acting.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaWhen I close my eyes, I can hear Transformers.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaRihanna is oblivious to whats going on.. BUT she is so hot.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@DragonBallPiece Well I hope you are right, and with your point of character developments etc, disaster movies generally have weak character development and a thin The Day after tomorrow, for example, most people I knew, me included went to see that just for the CGI. 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@nriab23 How can you honestly say that when you haven&#39;t seen it? Battleship is a 120hr plus film, 2 minutes and 6seconds does not show the character developments or the FULL plot. It doesn&#39;t go in depth at much, take the character Rihanna is playing for example the only word in the trailer she says is &#39;Boom&#39; or that white girl with the blonde hair i&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s not just a civilian. DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT&#39;S COVER.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaalien your move .. alien thinks .. SHIT you Blew up my carrier
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@Wrulol There may be a limited amount one can do in a battle ship movie, but they don&#39;t have to show the the alien in the trailer, it&#39;s just stupid.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaWhoever designed aliens in this movie must be a fan of the game, Dead Space :)
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaNavy recruitment numbers must be down....

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaWill y&#39;all stop complaining about how you think it&#39;s gonna have a simple story? WHO CARES.. have you seen the special effects, this is gonna be sick in the cinema.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI actually thought this Transformers until i saw Rihanna and then i was confused, wasn&#39;t sure what it was since i heard that Rihanna was in some next movie and this looks like transformers and sounds like transformers. 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@nriab23 I agree, at the moment of things becoming positive with the characters cheering, this made it too obvious that the movie will conclude well.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThey have shown way too much in this trailer tbh.... doesn&#39;t leave much to go to see the movie for...
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie..... Rihanna ‚ô• ya....!!!!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitai would like someone to make a sicence fiction film with a twist, such as aliens invade and kill us all and take over the planet, instead of humans always winning i think that would be a good film as no one would expect it. But this is just my opinion :)
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up for Rihanna&lt;3
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaRihanna saying boom makes me want to watch this. this is not shit people, its a world class Sicence Fiction movie. thats be real here
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaRihanna o.O
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaWow this looks awful.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThis film looks so bad I think it gave me a mild case of SPONTANEOUS CANCER!

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaSo this is just transformers again, but with ships that battle instead of cars?
Oh, let me guess: despite having far superior weapons and technology the aliens somehow lose, by neglecting their one weakness, and seeming to have no clear strategy, which the US navy uses to beat them and save the world.
Also, why the hell would aliens, who can and also bother, to travel through space bring boats and not more weapons so they can just destroy everything from orbit?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@SopeV0point1 sir, have you considered Halo?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaYes thats rihanna! lets hope shes as good as her singing!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@xxR4CH3Lxxp it is
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen Yes yes it is ;)
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@SopeV0point1 Yer I often think that but then there wouldnt be a film...
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitai dont get it i meen riahanna is fit and famous but she cant act for shit, she may be paid loads but she will ruin a allready OK film shame 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@TheSpecialTheory 

totaly agree
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaInstead of
 &quot;We&#39;re not going down without a fight&quot;
Why not say something along the lines of
&quot;Well, we&#39;re fucked but why don&#39;t we fuck them up with everything we got before they blow us up with their fucking red, supersized, WMD&quot;
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen looks like it lol...
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaif we don&#39;t get any boob from rihanna i&#39;m going to be disappointed.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitathe navy&#39;s answer to battle:la. christ.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaRihanna makes films whens shes not having sex 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitathis looks RIDICULOUS!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI hope Rihanna gets punched in the face by a Chris Brown alien.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@TuleRune +1
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaConnect 4: The Movie or GTFO.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita00:24 .. Pause, IT&#39;S RHIANNA!! 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitalol its a spartan at the begining lol

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@TheNomanex transformers are aliens too... TRANSFORMERSCEPTION!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen Yes she is in it :P
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen Rihana 3D ;-)

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen yes, it is.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThey look like Transformers

They sound like Transformers

But they&#39;re not Transformers, they are aliens??

THIS IS MADNESS!!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@ninjapig545 Just my opinion man. Although i did watch a pirate copy. Maybe i will give it another chance.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitai thought it was transformers 4 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitais that riahanna 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaEven the title of this movie is lame, I would like to see more &quot;Battle LA&quot; type movies or &quot;Skyline&quot;
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@thepecha7 how was battle LA shit it was awsome
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen Yup! 
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks pretty decent, i&#39;ll be so pissed off if it turns out to be shit!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThis better not turn out to be shit. Like Battle LA or Skyline. That shit pissed me right off.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why they needed to spend money on the Battleships trademark, just call it something else! This is totally unrelated to the board game!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaYou sunk my battleship!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitasir you may want to look at this its a spartan
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s a film about an alien race with EXTREMELY futuristic technology and at the end we win okay, it&#39;s not like any other film I&#39;ve ever watched.
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen yes
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaThat looks ACE!!


JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshita@jhusveen yes
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaIs that Rihanna?!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaWtf is Rihanaa doing in this film...?
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitaIs that Rihanaa....

JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitai realy want to see this movie!
JpoabtbEJOIdelimeterByIshitawanna watch NOW!!!!!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer alone is amazing, let alone the whole movie!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitawhich bgm it is
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaPlease tell the bgm of last 20-30 secs
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaMy absolute favorite trilogy! That absolutely nailed these three movies!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaQue filme my Friends....e vem a√≠ o 4
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita11 years later and I still have to revisit this trailer, it&#39;s just so incredible
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a>
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaRise: Caesar from a Prisoner ascending to the Leader of the Apes rebellion<br>Dawn: Caesar being a better Ape King and Father and overall a better Ape<br>War: Caesar ascending to a Godly and Biblical figure to the Ape kind
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita2011. My puberty days
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaan excellent, highly antertaining movie. however the trailer is pretty much a summary of the whole film, so why bother seeing the rest anymore?
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaAndor brought me here. Kino had the spirit of Casear in leading the prison break because he already led a revolution.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a>
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita11 years ago... They had no idea how to make trailers! I feel like I have watched it already!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaFunny that that explosion building part wasn&#39;t even in the movie and it probably would&#39;ve made the movie a little bit more enjoying the movie was great but it wasn&#39;t enough destruction in my opinion
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaCeaser is special to all the apes ü¶ß ü¶ç
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaZ√ºmra
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is summary of the whole film, lol
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaMax chimp energy
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer in the cinema and I watched it thinking, well not much.<br><br>Didn‚Äôt think it bad just wasn‚Äôt affected much by it.<br><br>It looked fine it just didn‚Äôt get me excited, mostly because there was nothing in the trailer that appealed to my interests.<br><br>Then the title came up and I realised the significance of what was in the trailer.<br><br>I had only seen the Tim burton remake and didn‚Äôt like it.<br><br>But never the less the prestige of the franchise made me interested. I wanted to see not only a modern planet of the apes but I was interested in how the humans lost it all.<br><br>I think now that‚Äôs a bad thing that I was tantalised by a logo, the title shouldn‚Äôt change how you felt or didn‚Äôt feel about the trailer.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaI would love a crossover with the monster verse
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a> But now he&#39;s gonna get egg yolk on his hands
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitadont know why Im rewatching the planet of the apes trilogy trailers but I heard of a 4th movie coming so.... just building hype
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaHonestly this is the best reboot of an classic sci fi movie franchise ever and this trailer is one of the best trailers too. It has gotten me motivated to watch the entire trilogy.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaReturn. To. Monke.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaHe‚Äôs so cute as a baby
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaOOO OOO A AAA A A A A A OOOOOO
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaSuch a awesome movie love the soundtrack too .
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitathe emotional side of the moive was just top notch
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita:)
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaThis is the one that got my ass in a theater seat.

VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a><br>This is the most loyal group of apes cesar has. Sad to think only one of them survives at the end of this AMAZING trilogy
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaWhat do you call this ape if he got ground up? A Ceaser Salad.<br>Dad jokes are the best
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaThis new saga was cool. But I feel sceptic about the number of apes. When they escape from Malefoy, they seem more numerous than they were before the escape. And I don&#39;t understand why those of the zoo fleed with them as these were not intelligent at that moment. And how could those from the zoo be coordinated during the attack of the golden gate if they were not intelligent enough? Plus, when you see how many of them were killed during the battle of the golden gate, you don&#39;t understand how they could be so numerous in the second opus. The same for the third opus (as Caesar discovers that the virus made apes smart all over the world only because Bad Ape said it). <br><br><br><br>Finally, the third opus was to close to Mo√Øse&#39;s story, it wasn&#39;t subtile. And what an idea to make an exode from forests to an &quot;oasis&quot; in the desert... their life will be more difficult there...
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaName of the music used near the end pls üòÉ
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzDt7uBBIOI&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a>
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaI love this film, very good, considering the success it had in the Box Office. Andy Serkis was the perfect man for the role of Caesar, like he was in The Lord of the Rings. I hope Frida Pinto, James Franco and Andy Serkis return for the sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The theories behind the creation of super intelligence is plausble, considering a genetic mutation separated mankind from his primate ancestry, sometime in the past. So, this is Planet of the Apes. Ha ha! Weird... 
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@heerka Except it is stupid doesn&#39;t make sense and is completely unrealistic.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@heerka Yes, I have watched the movie, you have a pretty dumb brain.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@AlexanderAmadeus aren&#39;t most of the movie trailers? especially hollywood films&#39;.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the music between 1:55 - 2:20 is...or why I could get it??
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitathis looks cool
but after just seeing the original, i almost don&#39;t want to see it, so the way the Apes won over man remains a mystery, since that was the greatest part of the twist ending
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@StrawberryRizla 

Lol. 
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@MixedReadings you cant stop anything without a gun, perhaps they should carry an ak47 too.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@StrawberryRizla 

that&#39; why i said &quot; its ironic &quot;
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaIt took me ages to realise that it was Tom Felton! His American accent is pretty good!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitathis looks fucking epic
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaYour classic learning experience turned Genocide.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@StrawberryRizla 

oh, because in the first movie, the apes rised because the humans killed em self in a &quot; nuclear war &quot;, and you mention nuke, lol, chill down man. 
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita&quot;you have no idea what you&#39;re dealing with&quot;

lol this has been said a billion times or so in movies
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaperhaps one day I&#39;ll escape and take over from you bloody humans!!!!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaFree range bush meat!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaholy crap is that Draco Malfoy?
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaWTF 200 chimps and 10 billion humans... And &#39;rise of the planet of the apes&#39; ????
I say machine gun-em. End of movie.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitalooks brilliant
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaWhy contain him when he hits you. He felt that someone he loved was being threatened and attacked the perpetrator. I&#39;m pretty sure if you saw someone you loved being threatened you would help them. Answer that. Would that make them our equal
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitathis looks fucking amazing!!!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but i don&#39;t see why the humans don&#39;t just bring in duke nukem to kick their asses
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaWatched Both Old Series. Planet Ape Fan.
Amazing. Awesome.
Great Movie.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita2:05 Cool !!
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita@akatsukimercenary 

Actually it was Image Engine that did the effects for D9 and not Weta.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita‡∏â‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshita2:05 This is just amazing. Kudos to WETA for the amazing work they do; they did in Lord of the Rings, the remake of King Kong, Avatar and District 9. I read the book this series is based on and like it. I only liked the original Planet of the Apes, but not so much with others in the series; the others deviated from the central theme of the series: arrogance and unacceptance of life taking its natural course. This prequel I am starting to like, tells the central theme of the series very well. 
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, but the trailer gives away too much of the story like most trailers do. 
I think I might enjoy the film more if I didn&#39;t see this trailer and know so much about what happens in the movie.
VzDt7uBBIOIdelimeterByIshitacant wait for this

BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaOmg.. This movie is horseshit. Very bad acting from Keanu..... He opens the door for some insane sluts, and they try to kill him afterwards, when he doesn&#39;t want to fuck them anymore. A married man, that can&#39;t control his desires. He&#39;s trying to save his life. Don&#39;t watch it. Really waste of time - and your precious life!!!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great but I have yet to have seen it
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaTwo girls when they kills his dog and stole his car, and come back to their boss, their boss slap their face, and their boss said: you have tough a wrong person, that person is John wick the most dangerous hitman on the world...........and he has another names, his names is boogie man, but actually he was sent to kills a fuckn boogie man and i once saw he kills three man in the bar with a pencils,.....

BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaOne of the most shitty movies i&#39;ve ever seen! Fucking terrible!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaWorth it.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaThe original is far better &#39;Death Game&#39; 1977
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaAss hole movie<br>..i never seen like this movie in my like....so disgusting movie
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaI never saw this movie but i hope they kill his dog just to see what happen..
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaEli has lost his shit. this sucked so hard.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitathe seducers death game
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaWhenever this film pops into my mind the first thing I say to myself is, &quot;I&#39;m not getting married&quot;.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitathis movie is just John wick in an alternative reality when the mafia did not kill his dog
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshita
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s stupid to where the witch is always a bad thing stupid movies piss me off
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitathis movie is a piece of shit
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaah feminism
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaNot that original. &quot;Hard Candy&quot; has been out a good while now, and has an unforgettable scene in it for sure. Stars Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaSo they seduce him, but then punish him ? Does that make sense ??
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaJohn Wick was killed by two girls!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaI guess this the prequel of John Wick, he even got the dog and house looks lot alike. <br>Spoiler alert, may by end of the movie he turns into John Wick ;)
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaHahahah Eli Roth should be banned by law to make movies
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitai like that eli roth is directing it, and keanu reaves is in it. But the fucking plot is absolute shit.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaLeave Keanu ALONE!!!!!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaIf I were to read the premise i would find it to be a movie of the week<br><br>but with Keanu Reeves and the way the trailer was made, this looks like a great original story.
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitawell this is something new, for the first time a man is being a &#39;&#39;victim&#39; ,  I had enough of all these movies in which women were being stalked or terrorized!!!!!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitajohn weak!!!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaWhatever you do don&#39;t kill his dog...
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaLooks like the same house in John Wick, PLUS he has the dog!
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaWhere is JOHN WICK 2??
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaFirst N Always Will Be....BTW Lord Wolf Approves (Y)
BHV0lsAqiS8delimeterByIshitaKnock knock ..Keanu Reeves ..

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI LIVE IN DAYTONA OMG
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOld guys must have any easy sex life (besides needing viagra/cialis assistance). Besides a girl who might say &quot;party your balls into my vagina&quot;, if an old guy found himself &quot;with&quot; any girl miles younger than &#39;em, rape/pedophilia is virtually outta question (once past 40-50, unless it&#39;s uncle to nephew). Like no one suspects old men for sex wo/ consent. This movie struck a full nugget gold mine.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaFrom someone that lives 45 minutes from Daytona Beach Florida and goes there all the time, It is never that Lit.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI just keep playing minute <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=2m19s">2:19</a> again and again and again...

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaThe adults react of this video by the fine brothers has more than double the views of this one.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitathis is a spin-off from Aubrey Plaza&#39;s movie the &quot;The To Do List&quot; but just trying to do old man De Niro!
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaIs this the long awaited conclusion to the Fockers movies?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaRobert De Nerd
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaSomehow de Niro cursing is so comforting...

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaWho came here from finebros?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaApril!!
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI gotta see this
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaSo comedy has basically turned into just cussing for the sake of cussing? That&#39;s not funny. Comedy needs more wit than that. If you want to see a funny dirty grandpa than watch Little Miss Sunshine not this piece of crap. Please don&#39;t spend your hard earned money to watch this movie otherwise the studios will just keep making crappy comedy movies like this.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOMG ROSE HATHAWAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOL
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaApril had to find other ways to pay rent
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Knoxville&#39;s grandpa would be played by DeNiro in Bad Grandpa 2.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaHEEEEEE MACARENA ESTA CANCI√ìN ES LA POLLA
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaWhoops, and they just slipped off... üòÜ
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaWell, there&#39;s one movie I&#39;m not going to watch.<br>The music&#39;s awesome though.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah.  Hope this is as awesome as it looks
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaIs that Dillion Harper? Not that I know who that is...
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here from Buzzfeed :)
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaIs this a sequel to bad grandpa?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaWanna be bad grandpa?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOkay, Dick is the perfect name for a dirty grandpa!
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOkay, I&#39;ll admit, the Macarena scene was funny. Also, I love that hashtag--You don&#39;t know Dick.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this movie XD
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a><br>is that the weird girl from Parks and Recreation??<br><br>daaaaaaamn she&#39;s much better in here xD
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaholly craaaap i cant wait to sit down with my grandpa and watch that!!!<br><br>i&#39;m sure he&#39;ll want to do the same after XD
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI have almost started to respect Zac Efron as a comedy actor. Few more years and I might forget High school Musical...
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshita&quot;<br>Bad grandpa&quot; was 1st
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> which song is that anybody know????
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitalol @ &quot;...i wanna FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!!&quot;
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI just smoked craaaaaaack
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaStill better than Bad Grandpa.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaThe dialogue sounds forced like they weren&#39;t trying to be witty they were just going for shock value. What makes raunchy comedies work is that the dialogue sounds natural and the characters aren&#39;t forced.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaMachinima promised nudity...
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a> April &lt;33333

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaApril Ludgate
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitai would bust aubrey plaza wide open
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOh De Niro, what you&#39;re doing with your career?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI have to be truthful, i didn&#39;t find zac efron cute back in the high school music years and a long time after, but he buff out and cut his hair around 2 years ago/current look,  and mmm damn that man is looking good.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m stuck in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> I think I have a problem guys....

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaAudrey Plaza in a thong, just let that happen
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t even crack a smile until that macarena part. :(
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaThat looks so great.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaI pressed &#39;3&#39; and now I can&#39;t stop, haha!
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaBedzie zajebisty film :D

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOh how the mighty have fallen. Does De Niro owe a shit ton of back taxes or something?
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaOkay that last part was funny.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaPoor Robert Deniro
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitamin. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1zlkaPpMsA&amp;t=2m15s">2:15</a> <b>-</b> ehhh macarena! :D

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaHahahaha, it looks funny.
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitalooks fucking horrendous
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaWell, at least it was Zac Efron that was doing the Macarena and not, y&#39;know, Robert De Niro....

q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitaSecond Comment!
q1zlkaPpMsAdelimeterByIshitalol looks alright
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaYeah, this is gonna be awesome. &#39;Nuff said.

ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI am not usually into this stuff but I have to admit that it certainly looks interesting so I will definitely give it a shot.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaKarma?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaWell Tom hanks ppl gorgeous huge and unbelievable stories ....he is a legend!!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI still don&#39;t get it... :/
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaAnyone knows what song there playing at the beginning, sounds beautiful! 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThank you for trying out what to me feels like solid and relatively in depth movie concept. Loved the matrix trilogy. hoping to love this.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitashould be the best film ever... but thats also what i said about tree of life...
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaso, regardless of whether or not I read the book it still looks like I&#39;m going to enjoy the shit out of this movie.  
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitawhere is Hugo?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita1:21 plunger
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThank you. :)
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks awesome, however I don&#39;t think the movie will succeed. The movie isn&#39;t long enough to do 6 story arcs, 30 minutes for each arc, if it were a 3 hour movie, which it is not. Early reviews are saying the same thing, its a mess of a movie. Read the book instead.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaHobbit FTW
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome cannot wait for it
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is all over the place... Mind F!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaearly reviews out of TIFF suggest otherwise 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is this crap, lol this will blow up so badly, what a shame 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based off the book with the same name which itself deals with reincarnation and that everytime we&#39;re reincarnated we meet the same people and make the same choices and mistakes, and trying to break that cycle and make different choices. Going by the trailer they&#39;re using the &quot;Cloud Atlas Sextet&quot; they talked about at the beginning as a way to bridge all of the different times these people are alive together...hope that makes sense...
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita...there have to BE cons.... I need to proofread this stuff better.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaSmarter, maybe. Better at math? Definitely. Then again, in a math competition between me and a one eyed, three legged hamster, the hamster would win so almost anything would make me better at math. But if it is parallel with racial stereotypes, I / We would also get much worse at driving. Just saying, there have to cons if there are going to be pros. Peaks and valleys.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaFun fact: Halle Berry is the white women at 0:24
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song that they use at the beginning of 1:05?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitatotally agree, movie wouldn&#39;t be so so, but at least we would get to enjoy it while its entertainment lasts.  Dice is so going down right now, hate the moment they took it from Steam into the gayest website community EVER!!! anyway, Chinese blood wouldn&#39;t harm us lol, at least it would make us SMARTER in a way, if you know what i mean ! :P
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI wish this was a Mirror&#39;s Edge movie trailer, at least it would make sense. Who am I kidding though? If they made a Mirror&#39;s Edge movie, it would suck balls. What they should do is make another game, but DICE is basically just the Battlefield Development Company now. Oh well, maybe they&#39;ll do one down the line at some point. That chick does look like Faith though. Is that supposed to be future Halle Berry? Ha, I guess we probably will all have some Chinese blood in us at that point.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it makes no sense.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita1:56 &lt; :D Yeah!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaBravo!  Bring it on!  This is &#39;What Dreams May Come&#39; and then some...  Can&#39;t wait for its wide release...  Sheer visionary genius!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaOMG !!!!!
THAT&#39;S THE GIRL FROM Mirror&#39;s Edge
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitawrecked the entire film
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaCant wait!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this. Interesting and moving trailer atleast. Nice nice.

ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not often a trailer makes you dislike then change to like
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaget ready to get mindfucked!!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaEPIC

ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaWTF is this film about please explain. :)
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita&quot;i thought it in a dream, in a nightmarish cafe. And the waitresses all had the same face.&quot; (ALL of them are Asian). hmmm stereo type much.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitalol
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitasorry bro, I just talk like that.... it&#39;s just how it comes out....
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThree directors. =(
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita2:08 portal is it you? :D
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaMy guess is it&#39;s about reincarnation.  They&#39;re talking about how all their lives are connected through the generations. One guy heard a kid playing the piano and said that&#39;s the song from his dreams, and you keep seeing a different people meeting each other for the first time but from the looks on their faces it&#39;s like they&#39;ve known each other all along.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks Oscar worthy.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI have to say that I usually avoid any movie with Tom Hanks in it like the plague but I might actually watch this, provided it gets good reviews. 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Did you ever think the universe was against you?&quot;   I&#39;ve been feeling that way for a long time now. 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitadid you not see extremely loud and incredibly close?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie might be nearly 3 hours or more ..
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty epic
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaHalle Berry looks pretty in red sari.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis film is like new, new, in many kind of ways! Love it!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaHoly feck! This looks amazing.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThe synopsis reminds me of the Fountain a little bit
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based on some 7th dimensional shit!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaYou swear a lot.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaSo, it&#39;s a movie about reincarnation?
From what it up and sounds like, it&#39;s all in the religious heaviness here.... and from what it looks like, it&#39;s also pretty motherfucking heavy in the special effects department....

I&#39;m all in the hopes that this has some incredible fucking plot that overshadows them two elements and makes small-work of them.
Otherwise I&#39;m calling this as shit.
I don&#39;t give a single unsolicited raving shit about some fucker who was part of the Matrix before.
fuck that noise
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita&quot;waitresses that had the same face&quot;  ....and the woman is asian (trying not to laugh)
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathis look really good and i havent seen a tom hanks movie in some time
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita0:45 - 0:50 and to think I was actually excited to see this film at first. I don&#39;t care if they actually *did* use the asian actress&#39; face over and over, I do not like the implication there that all asians look the same. It&#39;s made even worse when I went to the site and saw two non asian actors given epicanthical folds...
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie would be the biggest wig out on lsd.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaHalle Berry, Tom Hanks, crashes, guns, interracial couples, death, suspense, pianos, philosophical and controversial questions.

Yeah, I&#39;m game.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to eat this movie. I&#39;m gonna get this movie in my hair too.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitapretty much the guy&amp; the lady is reincarnated in different timelines. so you see old stuff and futuristic scenes having to do with a couple(or so i think)
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaReincarnation, Virtual Reality, Deja vu = Check points in our lives. Like Video games. Soon there may actually be another Kind of world we can live in again.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitai feel like this will be as confusing as inception was the first time
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathis is all about reincarnation. with some epic scenes. not a new idea. but it&#39;s good Hollywood isn&#39;t making remakes on 80&#39;s movies. interesting that it&#39;s picking up it&#39;s pace with movies like  inception which entertains the supernatural. 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshita... What?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathe other trailer of this is much more touching and brilliant cause it has a song called outro of m83.. ^^
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaHaha for a sec I thought Tom was going all castaway on us :P
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI think this trailer revealed too much info....very inceptiony+matrixie+babylony a.d.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaRe-incarnation, deja vu and the meaning of life..friends, this movie could either be a masterpiece or just a sloppy mess of a film.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s almost like a trailer FOR the extended trailer.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaits got every great actor u can imagoine
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaOH MY WORDDDDDDD.  &lt;3333333
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitareincarnation is real

ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitareincarnation dramatized...looks good!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathis remind me &quot;The FOuntain&quot;  
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaI need.  To see.  This.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaLooks SICK!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaLove and Hate...Courage and Fear...Hope and Loss...Time and Space...binding us all together.  
Forever.
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaKung Fu Panda?
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this remind me of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, always finding each other even after rebirth!!
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaGuy&#39;s it&#39;s got Tom Hanks in it. We can&#39;t go wrong
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThat awkward moment where you are wrong :L

It&#39;s based on the book of the same name, about six different stories set in different times, which are all connected in one way or another. The Wachowski&#39;s decided to use the same actors to play different characters from the six era&#39;s, as a visual link between the stories - exaggerating the similarities in the people that they portray.

... But yeah, this film looks epic :D
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks weird...
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaCOOL...:)
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitathis looks good but one prob.. wtf is happening??
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaconfused
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaThis Movie Looks Trippy 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaCool, this is kinda what i believe in, imagination, ad infinitum but also religion. 
ByehYal_cCsdelimeterByIshitaYou Win!!! Please... Great Movie... :D

8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaI honestly think this movie was an underrated gem. It wasn&#39;t the most accurate x-men, but it definitely was the most creative. The director took chances which is more than you can say for the current mcu. Good films need more risk and less predictable formulas
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite X-Men film Super underrated comic book film
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaONE SUN ONE LION ONE WOLVERINE
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaOpening To X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2009 DVD
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most under-rated Marvel movie.
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaxmen origins Wolverine star in start hindi on save TV channel par
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaProbably the best trailer for a movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Movie was alright but Gambit should‚Äôve been done better other than the card throwing part. Remember seeing trailer for first time in the theater and man was everyone stoked seeing Gambit üò≠
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaIf you think about it, the only &quot;weak&quot; thing in this movie is Deadpool, the rest is just ok if you compare it with the rest of the x-men trilogy
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer manipulates you into thinking this movie will be good. In all fairness this trailer is pretty dope
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaI say it‚Äôs a pretty good orgin for Logan seeing how his life was before he met the x men‚Äôs
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie it my favorite marvel x men movie ever I will keep watch this in every month every year
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this movie not on Disney + but all the Otter X-men movies are?????

8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaI was 10 years old when i saw this movie and enjoyed it and yes their were some parts i did&#39;t like which could have been better involves Deadpool and Gambit cause they made Deadpool a Baraka look a like near the end but in the beginning of the movie during the Team X scenes he was a badass with the swords and of course his humor Lol which is why Ryan Reynolds was born to play this character and as for Gambit he was good but did&#39;t have that much screen time. and the last thing i did&#39;t like was the Adamantium scene cause it was very different compare to Wolverine&#39;s flashbacks in X2 guess they were trying to make it less thrilling.

8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion this movie‚Äôs Wolverine seems really OP, X-24 will stand no chance.

8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s face it, we all watched this because of gambit lol.

8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaI came here just after watching Logan
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer looks so boring
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaThe movie wasn‚Äôt the greatest but it has the greatest opening scene in every X-men movie (close second with White House of xmen 2 &amp; 1944 scene of X-men 1)
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t care everyone else i love this movie and wolverine it&#39;s my favorite character
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing I was disappointed in was what they did with  Deadpool
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshitaSuch an excellent trailer for an ultimately disappointing film
8IxT7WFL6EcdelimeterByIshita‚ÄúOn May 1, witness the origin of how ‚ÄúWolverine‚Äù. began. ‚ÄúX-Men Origins: Wolverine‚Äù. Only in theaters Friday, May 1.‚Äù
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else recognize the Harry Potter trailer music? :P
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaall doubts erased.

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaAnd there are many paths to tread...
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitawho would not like this film lol this is going to be the best 3 film&#39;s since we had the lord of the ring&#39;s from jackson
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaSo you don&#39;t want to watch it?
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaHe gives us all courage. Thanks Peter, et al!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaYesssssss
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaone does not simply want to watch the hobit
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaEPIC
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaRadagast.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaStrongholder123 made a pretty good point
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaKill the DRAGON!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitalol this is not 48 fps, Youtube can only go up to 30 fps. A higher frame rate would make it look less &#39;animated&#39;, not more.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaYeah - as a flashback device I think. They&#39;re all reading Bilbo&#39;s memoirs or something like that
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI thought Saoirse Ronan was excellent in it, as well as Tucci. But yeah I&#39;ll have to look that up!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaHe may have not been in the book, but Peter Jackson made it clear he would be in The Hobbit.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaNot true, he would HAVE to have been there, because he is the son of the Elf King Thandruil, who resides in Mirkwood and the Dwarves have a rather long visit (or imprisonment)there. He&#39;s never explicitly mentioned(because Tolkien wrote the Hobbit before LOTR) but it is very reasonable to have him there in the movie (It  would actually be rather strange if he wasn&#39;t). He didn&#39;t appear in this trailer because obviously there was no Mirkwood scenes.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaOh, or Beorn? lol
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI love how this was done by the creators of the original movie trilogy for LotR. And how they got many of the original actors in too. Totally brilliant and not often enough received treat.

The only thing that distracts a little is, not Bilbo&#39;s actor being different, but that he looks so much younger than Ian does in LotR. I mean, he wasn&#39;t supposed to have physically aged one day since this adventure but clearly he&#39;d have if this Bilbo is supposed to be the same from LotR. :D
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaStone Giant, quite lore friendly.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshita1:20...Radagast or Tom Bombaadil??
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaTom Bombadil?
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshita7 Dislikes from Snow White&#39;s 7 dwarfs.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThe Hobbit is the book written by JRR Tolkein that tells the story of Bilbo Baggins&#39;s adventures, how he originally got the ring... so it&#39;s basically the story before LOTR&#39;s
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer seems 24 fps at least.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitai can,t wait to see this if you love the lords of the ring then you love this movie to 
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitafdhewkjfnafdnkasldfnask,dmsnaKFSNkfnasklnfcs\adlkfgnaeslkfvas\n.!!!!!!!!!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.  

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI think that&#39;s the Goblin King that falls on them at the end.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaHome is now behind you... &gt;.&lt; &quot;Spins around in comp chair&quot; o.O 
Yep.. It&#39;s still behind me, I got lost in middle earth for a minute there..) :D

Awesome! Just awesome! Can&#39;t wait! :)
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaYes sir ree!

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshita2:08
Home is behind,
The world ahead...
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitahe was never in &#39;The Hobbit&#39;
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaGandalf! 

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaIt was ok.  King Kong, LOTR and now this, the guy&#39;s a magician.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitawow
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitais the old man Radagast?

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshita@DeshiBye No it wasn&#39;t. Stanley Tucci summed it up pretty well at the Oscars when they showed him during the best supporting actor section.  Turned to the person next to him and said, it was terrible. Watch it if you can find it, is actually kinda funny.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaha ha ha the ending was too funny!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Legolas?!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThe Lovely Bones was a fantastic movie!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThis is like Call Of Duty?
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI have one word to describe Peter Jackson....genius...simply geniu, wait, scratch that, he made Lovely Bones.  Genius doesn&#39;t really fit then, does it?
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThorin is a BOSS.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI was skeptical about this being better than LotR... It looks amazing!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitawas that a rock golem i saw falling down a cliff and that ending was hilarious
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaNerdgasm.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaSecond and Third movie. 
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaThat could&#39;ve been worse....... BAM!!!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI remember reading this book in junior high school. I hope my comic will gain a 100th 

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitai have one word to describe peter jackson....genius...simply a genius 
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaDat Hobbit Trailer
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!!

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaYeah, where&#39;s Smaug?!?

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitalock good ,but 3 movies are to many
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI stopped my porn for this trailer, but I continued masturbating. 
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitasorprendente!!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaWow. That was the most awesome trailer I&#39;ve ever seen!!! My worries have just gone, they&#39;re non-existent. Bring on December already!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI CAN¬¥T WAIT...
Oh! wait a second.... I have been waiting for this movie 3 years... 3 months are nothing...
I guess... ._.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaWin ALL the awards!!

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaOne does not simply... watch this trailer once.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaPeter Jackson, YOU ARE MY HERO!!!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaHm, I thought the first trailer was better imo. 
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitai love boufurs northern accent
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaFun fact: Music at the end of the trailer is from a DH2 trailer....
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaAH That part of the book about the riddles. One of my favorite. Wonderful trailer!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshita1 dislike from Smaug
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI cannot WAIT to make some of Beorn&#39;s honeycakes to sneak into the midnight show.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaamazing &lt;3
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaSo looking forward to this film. It looks fantastic.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaIt says a lot about modern cinema, that a 2 minute trailer is better than most films this year
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be having the best Birthday for the next three Decembers. I just want to roll on the floor in happiness.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE that the feel of the movie is fantastical and fun and mystical and like a children&#39;s movie, in a way. Because that&#39;s exactly how the novel was. LOTR was serious and epic, and Peter Jackson showed that. Now, The Hobbit is fun and narrated as if to a child, and this film shows that perfectly. Peter Jackson is SO GOOD AT MAKING THE ATMOSPHERE PERFECT FOR THESE FILMS.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitahave to say i loved the music of the first trailer,felt more epic and grand that the music here.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaReplay button? Oh yeah, I think I broke it.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitadamn this is looking beautiful :)
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaWow this is amazing I can&#39;t wait until December
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitauhh.... &#39;course it is
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaepic!!!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitalooks like a Cousin of Ring Series.

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaHobbits are back :D.. cant waiiiiit !
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitamaybe it&#39;s because of the new technology used by Jackson..
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this movie to come out! :OOO
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaOH MY HOBBIT!!! Another EPIC trilogy begins...! &lt;3 :D

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaSo excited!
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaholy hell this looks awesome! between this, skyfall, and django unchained the next 3 months will be great.
SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaOh my Martin Freeman. You are the Bilbo. Perfect little hobbit.

SDnYMbYB-nUdelimeterByIshitaI honestly didn&#39;t think they could do better than the first trailer with the dwarf song. I was wrong, internet. I was SO WRONG.

RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp is rolling in his grave.
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaSong?
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitasigh..... why is this set in a high school.....why not a fucking community college....lots of drugs at a community college.....iced tea went to a community college...Im positive. 

RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaThis looks really bad.
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaThis looks wayyy too mean spirited. And I never get offended by swearing but does anyone else think that it&#39;s completely unfunny and unnessecary in this trailer? 
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaDepp rotates in his grave.
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitano.  no.  no.  this looks like fucking shit.  i like jonah hill but there&#39;s more to him than this.  and also, channing tatum can&#39;t fucking act worth a shit.  i can barely understand half the shit he says as he mumbles throughout the entire film.
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitalame..

they want to destroy everything that actually had quality back in the days...

screw this
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks hillarious. Too bad they slapped the name &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; on it. Because it&#39;s not. Nawmean?
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s killing me is all the cursing and slapstick. 21 Jump Street didn&#39;t have all that. They had moments of humor sure, but everything else was drama and badass 80s action!
RLoKtb4c4W0delimeterByIshitaI knew the minute I heard Jonah Hill was writing this project it would suck. 21 Jump Street is and always should be a drama. A little comedy in it is not a bad thing but to make it a complete comedy it will suck majorly. Here is how I believe the movie will go down. 

Jonah Hill and Tatum&#39;s character will be the screw ups of the team. Screwing up so bad that they will get thrown off the case and get into an argument over whose fault it is. Later Tatum&#39;s character will realize who the real bad g
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaReminded me of the game Bully before the music part.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song called which is playing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a>.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song towards the end of the trailer?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good I will definitely go see this.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaClicked on this one because it said that the trailer had Aiden Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy and they were barely in it.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSong in the last scene?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitayou&#39;re a big potato
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitawhat are you doing there Littlefinger?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWas being transferred to a new school part of your plan?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWas getting transferred part of your plan?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to watch this for the music and the good old feel/nostalgia.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie about Duran Duran? I did t get anything from this trailer
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaUhh, you don&#39;t get to transfer students...
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaYeah, just go ahead and spoil the whole frickin&#39; film. -_-
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitai feel like i already saw the entire movie in the trailer lol. but i liked once and begin again, so I&#39;ll probably check it out.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLittlefinger?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaMy type of movie!<br><br>I love coming of age movies and this looks similar to Almost Famous which I loved!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWaiting on The Beatles movie with real actors
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLittle finger!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitathis looks 20 times better than rock of ages !
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI have to know that the ending song is from this trailer. The tune is going to be stuck in my head for days
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of that song, the final one?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look new, but also doesn&#39;t look bad ... Plus director of once and begin again? Might actually be good!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSOMEONE NAME THAT SONG
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitai ve to say: Nice tr√°iler!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitasure to be a hit. i get good vibes from this and it also reminds me of the 80&#39;s for some reason.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitawhats thesong that starts a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> til the end. i hope someone knows.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitalast song?!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaThat girl sounds like Luna Lovegood
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t think much of this trailer at first but this actually might win an academy award, I feel...
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaMuah!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song starting to play at around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> till the end? Please reply if you know. Thanks
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLord Baelish having financial problems... It&#39;s just doesn&#39;t make any sense!!!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLittle finger!!!!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaim only gonna watch this because of THE CURE.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI wounder who keep making these long-ass trailers that basically show every major scene and the climax of the movie? This is one of the few dramas I want to see. But I already know EVERYTHING that going to happen.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI thought it&#39;s joey graceffa in the thumbnail
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitathat closing song is great :D
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was about Mayor Carcetti the Master of Coin.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSon, I&#39;m CIA.<br>Uh, you don&#39;t get to transfer schools.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSing Street....Beat Street....hmmm.....
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLook good..,I want to watch the whole of it.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think this trailer did what it wanted to. It got me hyped for the next season of game of thrones.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaoruchumaru
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaThe 80s gave way to a lot of legendary bands and music.  I think it&#39;s because back then creative priorities were different, and people were still truly free to pursue and be whatever type of musicians they wanted to be, and most of all, experiment freely.  I always get this vibe from the 80&#39;s that people were more concerned with making music they liked, than fitting a certain genre, or having a specific &quot;marketable&quot; look just to sell themselves more than their music.  <b>Shooting at the walls of heartache, Bang, bang, I am the warrior!</b>
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not thumbing down cause I think the movie will be bad. I&#39;m thumbing down how this trailer was cut.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitai want to see it
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSo, just to clarify: to get the girl, you need to pretend to be someone you&#39;re not, eventually transform into that fiction, and it will work out?  The Oldest Story in the Book that never told the truth once comes to mind.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitahey look, you can pay to listen to your favorite songs to the backdrop of some teen chasing a girl, and he gets her in the end. what a waste of money
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaOh a new Harry Potter Movie
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaIs... Is this seriously a movie about a band from Synge Street Primary/Secondary School in dublin?! If so those fights at the start are very relevant then. That place is a shit hole.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLove it!! The soundtrack is epic
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a> pleaseeeee
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWill there leprechauns and pots of gold in this film............ffs
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWas creating a band part of your plan?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me the song at the end?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaHere come the GOT references.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t sit thru 5 mins of this shit
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaBeing a huge fan of The Commitments, I&#39;m looking forward to this
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitacoming soon to a garage sale near you
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaTell me about bane why does he sing
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaCould&#39;ve been Genesis with Peter Gabriel though, just sayin.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaNice short film....
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshita...you had me at, Take On Me. :P
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaActress in the thumbnail looks like if Zelena from OUAT wore Avatar Kyoshi&#39;s make-up.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaTell me about Bane! Why is he in a band?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaDid I just watch the whole movie?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaBANE?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitafuck...I listen to Phil Colins...
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaAt least, there aren&#39;t only &quot;street rap&quot; movies.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI saw many musical instruments, but where is BALALAIKA? Without BALALAIKA it is not cooool!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was cobie smulders
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting serious Son of Rambow vibes from this trailer and that&#39;s a very good thing.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLooks lame
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaA nostalgia flick that isn&#39;t based in America! Yay! I love seeing different points of view on the same subject. Growing up in the 80&#39;s has been done to death in American cinema and so any European, Asian, or African perspectives are amazing.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSo... The Commitments? With kids instead?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaBy the numbers. Setting a movie in the 80s (fun clothes!) and in England (fun dialects!) doesn&#39;t change the fact that it hits every damn trope for a movie of this kind.<br>Wasted opportunity.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitainstant classic
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSong in the last scene?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitatoo much singing, 4/10 - IGN
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaYa think we&#39;d be able to get decent movies but as usual Ireland produces shite.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSundance 2016!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaSong?
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song in the last part? so catchy. not darude sandstorm please.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaOf deluge if nostalgia flicks Hollywood is drowning us in, this is the 1st that I honestly think is worth the price of admission.  Looks like a fun time.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m feeling an Almost Famous level of quality, looking forward to this one.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitahii
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLooks quirky, fun and OH MY GOD PETYR BAELISH IS IN IT!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaWhat this? The origin of the Beatle.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaAmazing human-being, next level compliments.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI bet this comment won&#39;t get a single like!!!
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaI like it
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaesrly
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like fun :)
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitait seems like it&#39;s a good family movie.
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshitaso.. the commitments anyone? got that same vibe
jYk2Vx1z6lkdelimeterByIshita100th view
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaAs soon as I saw that woman and saw her cut of the light, I screamed for joy. Becuase I knew exactly who this was. lol Some of the best horror shorts on YouTube. I&#39;m really happy for him.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LiKKFZyhRU&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a> Made me lose interest completely
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaAll of these stupid horror movies now and days follow the same theme and formula. There&#39;s always at least one kid and at least one woman who interacts with the kid. This is more than likely just going to be PG-13 garbage. I don&#39;t know who really pays to watch these movies at theaters, but you guys are wasting your money. These are probably used as date movies I guess. I wouldn&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t had a girlfriend in ten years (-__-)
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitait looks okay. will always prefer the original short flim imo.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaSo basically she is like Pride for Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood... interesting
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaDid the Black guy just die?
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaso.... is it lit?
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaAnd this comes out on my birthday...sigh.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaNope I&#39;m good.. Bye.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaHell nah

6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaI have been a fan of ponysmasher  for more than a few years now. This makes me really excited. So Thrilled!!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaOMG
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitacan they not just turn on a light permanently and if it starts turning itself off &#39; just call the electrician&#39;.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah! :D
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitai need to see this
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitagoddamn how hard is it to leave the lights on? just pay the bills and you get no chills
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaMeh! The Short Film is way Better than this.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitano way
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing scary about this is the jump scare music that is totally unnecessary
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitavery nice trailer
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaJust keep the lights on how hard is that to do?
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaI think this is based on the short film.. Am I right???
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who came here because of David (&lt;3)? xD Also, &#39;cause of Lotta, too &lt;3
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this one!!!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitacliche horror again! not expected from you James Wan!!!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitathis should be short films you crazy fucking idiots fuck you james wan by the way thanks for the conjuring
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitacheap thrills. James is a bitch
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good definitely gonna go seeüòçüíôüòà
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaKind of reminds me of an X-Files episode, where a guy got turned into a shadow or something.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaGive me all the flares and flashbangs.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LiKKFZyhRU&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a> Perfect hiding
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitathe short film was short and sweet with an interesting idea. this looks like long and sour with no original ideas. the hand grabbing at the end? really?
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaYes, this was a short film before. I looked it up before watching this trailer. Reminds me of Darkness Falls a little bit.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitasuch a great concept. I&#39;m interested.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaIM IN LOVE
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitakeep the ligths on, they must always stay on.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaFor anyone who isn&#39;t aware, this is a feature-film adaption of the short film LIGHTS OUT, directed by the director of the short, starring the same actress from the short film in a cameo at the beginning of the film. It&#39;s not a rip-off, it&#39;s a straight forward adaption of the short by the same exact director.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitato scary omg I&#39;m gonna have a heart attack
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHHAHA, fuck that!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaSo what&#39;s the point of going to watch it now? I think I pretty much saw it the whole movie except for the boring parts
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched The Conjuring 2-Main Trailer and now this!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaOh my god why did I confuse this for a FNAF movie trailer? The light switch looked like a little pixel foxy to me when I saw it!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of a short film that i saw in class with the same name
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaRacist !!! boooo
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitawtf you guys stole the idea of that one short film called lights out in 2013. and the same name wtf give them credit at least üòí
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaThought this was going to be a rom-com, big mistake.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaIs this based on that short horror video that swept the Internet a couple years ago? The concept is crazy similar!
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaHELL NO
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaMan fuck watching this lol<br>There&#39;s an obsession with horror films and scaring people shitless.
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitacant wait to see this movie about ethan bradberry&#39;s life
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaQuand on a pas d&#39;inspiration et qu&#39;on pique la production des autres :(
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just a classic, stupid scary movie
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaHi
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaI had to watch this without volume... honestly the conjuring doesn&#39;t scare me but this trailer gave me the creeps
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking hilarious
6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshita...And now i&#39;m scared of dark, nice.

6LiKKFZyhRUdelimeterByIshitafirst
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie üçø
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaLast movie I saw in the theater because most modern movies suck. I could not take my eyes off of Richard Gere. It is a movie you should not take your eyes off of.
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaUh-oh. Oops. It suuuuuuuucks.
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaIs this movie alluding to the current Israeli prime minister?
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaentertaining for sure
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaFor those who have a brain and understand nuance, this is one of the best films literally ever.<br><br>However: SHAME on Sony Classics for not releasing this on Blu. (crappy BS AMAZON CDR doesn&#39;t count in 2017)<br><br>Score: Joseph Cedar, Gere, everyone involved with the film: A++++ turned to 11.<br><br>Sony Home Entertainment: FFFFFFF
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaThis is what great movies look like, because they mirror real life. This is my kind of movie. Thanks.
TZMCfZq3qc4delimeterByIshitaThis movie will work. Stay positive.

n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaYes it is - nice pick!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaYeah she&#39;s in it...don&#39;t think she has a big part but its still awesome
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaLogan Lerman comienza a seguir los pases de Johnny. Verlo en The three Muskeeters haciendo el papel de un egolatra, presumido, y despu√©s verlo en un papel donde su personaje es un chico t√≠mido y demasiado emocional en The Perks...IS AMAZING! Mis emociones al leer el libro fueron sorprendentes: re√≠, llore. Amo el libro y no puedo esperar para septiembre.  
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshita(&#39;:
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI am the only one that thinks that in this movie she doesnt seem to be hermione
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitashe could get it.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaMy favourite book!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t read it yet but even I teared up. 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshita2:11 is that nina dobrev...? 
I cant wait for this movie &lt;3 :)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitalogan and emma.. reasons why i&#39;ll watch this film. but it&#39;s kind of awkward that emma is speaking in american accent. 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why but the minute the song &quot;IT&#39;S TIME&quot; from IMAGINE DRAGONS comes on, my eyes swell with tears. This trailer makes me so emotional, maybe because as cheesy as it sounds, it&#39;s awakens something that was once alive in all of us. CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS! 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI can just tell this will be a great movie!! :)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaahsfjkdhksjflsd.

Logan,Emma &amp; Nina in the same movie i might die XD
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s time - Imagine Dragons
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaLiterally watching it over and over again.
I&#39;m so emotionally attached to this book I can&#39;t even handle seeing it come to life.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaImagine Dragons - It&#39;s Time. Great tune, you should definitely check it out.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaThe boy from We Need to Talk About Kevin!!!! ;A;

n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitai&#39;m way too excited for this movie
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaEmma Watson=PERFECTION AND TALENT AND GOOD LOOKS!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshita&quot;Call it Slut and the Falcon, make us solve crimes!&quot; LMAO!!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaoh Emma... how can you be so perfect?... HOW?!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaNINA DOBREV AT 2:11
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaEZRA ^__^
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitahas anyone else watched this numerous times and started chanting &#39;BE AGRESSIVE PASSIVE AGGRESIVE&#39; along with patrick?......no just me......ok
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshita&quot;BELOW AVERAGE!&quot;
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaPatrick looks like the best character tbh. I hate how they&#39;ve changed the quote that everyone knows &quot;..in that moment..&quot; and also how Charlie isn&#39;t the one that actually says &quot;We accept the love we think we deserve&quot; in the book. But hey, can&#39;t keep it the same obviously. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how they make it into an actual movie from a bunch of letters. I love the book and I will most definitely be seeing this movie as soon as it comes out :)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaugh crying this couldn&#39;t have been more perfect
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaThis movie&#39;s shit and it cannot be expressed in words.
Anyways whats wrong with Watson&#39;s accent.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaFAPFAPFAPFAPFAP

n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t even wait! the book is perfection and so better be the movie!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaSHIVERS OH MY GOD I&#39;M SO EXCITED
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaimagine dragon is perfect for this trailer!!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited for this movie!! If you haven&#39;t read the book, read it... It&#39;s perfect. 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI READ THIS BOOK BEFORE IT WAS COOL. js.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI have been waiting for this movie forever. &quot;And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.&quot; Best quote from the book ever, I HIGHLY recommend everyone reads it!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaoh god, i can&#39;t wait for this movie!  ahh, logan lerman is perfection and this book is perfection!  and of course the lovely emma watson is perfection, too :3
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaLOGAN LERMAN + EMMA WATSON + A MOVIE TOGETHER = PERFECTION
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer upped my expectation. I can&#39;t wait. For all those who haven&#39;t read the book, GO READ THE BOOK. You&#39;ll never regret it.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaWatching this with tears in my eyes, I can&#39;t wait to see this! It looks amazing... :)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaThis movie actually looks amazing.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI really have high expectations for this movie as this book is my favourite. I&#39;m really hoping it turned out amazingly and they&#39;ve captured the essence of the novel.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaDying to see this movie. I can not wait for release!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitahdkjskjfhkashf OH MY GOD
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaemma watson american accent haha :D
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaNeed to watch!! :D
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait &lt;3
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI saw lol
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait to see this, i can tell they did a really good job!!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI hope so!! But I tend to be a slow reader, so it may take me longer? How many pages is it, approximately? If you remember? 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaso, NiNa Dobrev is in this movie ... she likes Teenage Movies x)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitabecause it¬¥s amazing :)
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitacrying, i cannot wait!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaYou can seriously get through the book in like two days. Most people I&#39;ve lent my copy out to can&#39;t put it down.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaPerfect book, perfect actors and a perfect movie.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaFINALLY! been waiting for this FOREVER!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaher character -.- 
plus just watching the movie won&#39;t give it justice. now unless you&#39;re not even a teenager you can read the book, it has a great message that the movie will show. js
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaMy mission is to read this book before September.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI understand the excitement of Emma being in this, but you have to admit that Logan and Ezra are just as good.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaBE. AGGRESSIVE. PASSIVE. AGGRESSIVE! 
Ezra as Patrick &lt;3  had my doubts but he&#39;s perfect
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitawell it comes out in fall. plenty of time to go get the book and give it a read :) 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI was nervous for Ezra as Patrick but he seems awesome!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this to come out.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaBless your comment.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaemma watson, fuck yeah.
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitai think nobody notices but NINA DOBREV is in there 2..playing logan&#39;s older sister
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitawhat song is playing at the end of the trailer?
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaWhenever Hermione talks w/ an American accent, it doesnt really feel right. :)) 
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaI think the main star of this movie is Logan Lerman not Emma!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaimagine dragons FTW &lt;3
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaThe book is amazing!
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaEmma Watson&#39;s beauty cannot be expressed in words :D
n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshita&quot;Welcome to the island of misfit toys,&quot; just kidding, I&#39;m Emma Watson.

n5rh7O4IDc0delimeterByIshitaSo, it has come to this...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitabread
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitavery nice but ............
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAs I watch this, it&#39;s extremely awkward since my name is Jackie too.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaInaccurate asf holy shit
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaNatalie Portman for president
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThe same evil bastards who murdered Jack, are still in power in America, the U.K., Russia, etc..JFK was our LAST TRUE PRESIDENT. As soon as he told the JCS to prepare to pull out of Vietnam, told J. Edger Hoover that he must resign as the director of the FBI by 1964, fired the director of the CIA in 61-62, &amp; put in motion plans to Audit The federal Reserve, THEY BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RIPJFK">#RIPJFK</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RIPRFK">#RIPRFK</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RIPMLK">#RIPMLK</a>
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI hope his secret society speech is in there. it&#39;s the reason he was killed...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaspoiler alert. her husband dies
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThere will be a movie on Melania too.....on pornhub though
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaLana del Rey should sing for this Movie
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitagood job leaving Marvel <br> great trailer
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOscar bait if I ever saw one.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOscar click bait!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitalol bitch acting like she got shot lmfao
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re just gonna pretend JFK was a perfect president who totally didn&#39;t have a crippling sex addiction right?
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOscar
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaTo believe Melania Trump is taking that role, wow
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI get a Kubrick vibe from the cinematography
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAhem.. Oscar.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaaccent is terrible üëé
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaüíü
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThor is going to be pissed
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer blew my mind.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitathis is an oscar, for sure
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaIf she doesn&#39;t get an Oscar next year that means she got robbed
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOkay we get it...You lost Jack
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThat accent shocked me. Didn&#39;t even know it was Natalie narrating until I saw her lips moving.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWhen are you guys going to make the film &#39;Melania&#39; ?
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaBlack widow. Ruined every man she got near, poisonous bitch
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaits gonna be flop like the Diana one mark my words
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaSave me a ticket.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaKennedy&#39;s one of my favorite presidents. Easily in my top 3.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaGive dat lady an Oscar!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaNatalie going for that second Oscar.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaJohn F. Kennedy had a pure heart, wish we had him now.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAmazing! Looking forward to watching the movie. But he will only arrive in my country, Brazil, next year. Did anyone else smell Oscar?<br>Kennedys
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitashe&#39;s cute, but the movies wack
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaNatalie Portman is starting to show her age. I can&#39;t believe the Star Wars prequels were so long ago...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI was hoping this would be about Jackie Chan. 0/10 will not watch.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaHollywood feeding feminist, I&#39;m sure they were counting on Clinton to win, give it a rest
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaGot that Terrence Malick feel.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI smell Oscar porn, and I love it
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI love Natalie Portman!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitai thought its Jackie Chan movie.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaShe could win an Oscar just from this trailer alone.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaPoor Jackie
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWhy would anybody want to watch this, its just sadness and tragedy all over again on screen. We already know what happened.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI predict another Oscar for Natalie...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaFeels like a Terrence Malick movie.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaNatalie Portman is one of the greatest actors of our time. And I still think she&#39;s underrated! This looks amazing!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshita&quot;A psychodrama of hypnotic intimacy.&quot;<br><br>Now that&#39;s the proper way to hype. And Levi should at least be nominated for Original Score.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitalooking for the Oscar nom I see
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaCan someone cut a &#39;&#39;Padme: a Star Wars story&#39;&#39; trailer out of this and her Padme performances? <br>Hopefully she kills the award season recently saw her SW Cowboy girl movie, glad she is back on the spotlight instead of wasting her talents playing superhero girlfriends in movies that in no way deserved her...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaDamn! Just give her the Oscar.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitawas it me or in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9pW3B8Ycc4&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> is playing Mylo Xiloto??
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaSo touching. I love Natalie.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitai&#39;m super excited to see it but are you really trying to tell me that it&#39;s more complex and demanding than her role in black swan?? i guess ill have to wait and see
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitameh pure oscar bait
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m already crying
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWhen will &quot;Melania&quot; trailer come out?
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaremember remember. damn does she ever age?
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaMica Levi who did the incredible film score to Under the Skin is doing this film score. Nice!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThe most depressing part is knowing that we used to elect presidents with intellect and class and now we have Trump. I wont see this movie because I am depressed enough.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait omg!!!!!!!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song towards the end? thanks.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaChills
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaCannot wait!!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited to watch Lana Del Rey&#39;s new movie
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThe wait is excruciating!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWhowell.... that got me the shivers
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaA Must See
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaThe way she can subtly express complex emotions with just a glance is hypnotizing. I smell an Oscaaarrrrr
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait from Trump to reveal who actually shot Kennedy.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI am in love
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaLooks like Foxcatcher meets Black Swan.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really curious about 2 things. Who and Why. Who are the 6 people that give it a thumbs down and Why. This is gonna be a brilliant movie. Natalie Portman nailed it like usual. A sure oscar for her, she rally deserve it.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaIt looks excellent. I will definitely see it.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitawe don&#39;t need to watch the movie to say that she is getting another Oscar.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaMe encanta, y ver a una actriz como Natalie Portman es siempre un placer.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaEITA PORRA! Vem Natalie,s√≥ vem...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOh my God, this gave me chills... amazing performance of Natalie Portman, it makes me feel proud of been chilean and compatriot of director Pablo Larra√≠n!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaComing for that second Oscar.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaMonsters.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaalong with Viola Davis in Fences, this HAS to be the best performance of 2016,
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitahermosoooooooo &lt;3 ya quiero verla
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s safe to say that she&#39;ll be taking the oscar for this one.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaWell, there&#39;s no doubt Natalie will get an Oscar for this, I can&#39;t wait for this, It looks incredible.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaName of the song from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9pW3B8Ycc4&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9pW3B8Ycc4&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a> ?<br>Really catchy.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAs a fellow Chilean I really hope this movie puts Pablo  Larrain (maybe the best Chilean director working today) on the mainstream map.<br><br>Sad that he&#39;s not making the Scarface remake anymore, hopefully this movie will open many more doors for him.
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAnd the oscar Goes To!!!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaOMG, the scene in the motorcade looks so shocking with the blood and everything.Can¬¥t wait for this movie
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaSomewhat Oliver stone&#39;s jfk part 2 but in version of jfk&#39;s wife side
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaPablo Larrain
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaMy favorite actress!
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaLooks promising D:
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes too...
g9pW3B8Ycc4delimeterByIshitaFirst!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshita80&#39;s Movie Stereotype pfft..
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the title of the song at the beginning?
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaWell that&#39;s pretty much much the whole movie.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaAll of you haters haven&#39;t even seen the bloody film. I have enough trust in Linklater to know that it will be at least a good film. I enjoyed the trailer a lot.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaZoey Deutch &lt;3
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaCHAD
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaLinklater has lost his fuckin mind.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaAlso this movie portrays 1980 a HELL of a lot better than Mr. Holland&#39;s Opus ever did when it came out 20 years ago!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitabut what the f is up with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6raUs0CiCQ&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a> scene, doesn&#39;t correlate with the girls being on the driver side, then we see them on the passenger side through the car?
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaA lot of hate for a trailer. It&#39;s a plot-less movie that is suppose to make you feel as if you were in the back in the 80&#39;s and that is what it does for me, and is one of the things that made Dazed great.¬†Also, the trailor for Dazed would&#39;ve been bad in this format, but¬†I actually like it, gives me an animal house type vibe
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI came her for tyler hoechlin because I know the sequel is never as good as the first movie
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaLooks horrible
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaembrace your inner strength. be weird
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE Dazed and Confused and I adore Hoechlin but this looks and feels like any other modern-but-set-in-a-dated-period gimmicky frat film. It&#39;s been done too many times and usually doesn&#39;t deliver.<br>Hopefully there&#39;s more to it than is implied by the trailer but based on the trailer itself, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to pay to watch it. Hoechlin was barely in the trailer and he&#39;d probably be my main motivation to watch it as it stands.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaDazed and confused rip off,.But whatever
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this is going to be disappointing :(
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI gotta see this! This looks authentically like 1980!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaZOOOOEEEEEYYYYYY!!! &lt;3
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaNot right, not right, not right
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI actually know the black guy in this trailer. He and I went to the same high school, and we were even in band together
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks more like a cheap knock-off of Dazed and Confused, rather than a classic Linklater movie.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaDerek left for this ?! üòÇ
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitai get older but the girls stay the same look at that discount Matthew McConaughey
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaIdk why this reminds me of dumb &amp; dumberer. The dumb sequel of dumb &amp; dumber without Jim Carrey.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaMan, I would never have guessed this was a Linklater movie if I hadn&#39;t seen his name attached.  Doesn&#39;t really look like it&#39;s on his level.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaA bro movie for bros, bro.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitadereekkkkk stop partying nd go back to STILESSS !!!!!!!!!!!!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI quess they ran out of teenage actors and had to settle for 40 year olds.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaDerek what is up with your hair?!?! Is that a side effect of being a full wolf???
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitayessss hoechhh
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitafeels kind-of forced.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaDazed and Confused was not this goofy. This is basically modern times with people dressed up in clothes that look like the late 70s-early 80s transition period. Like some cornball American Pie humor type shit.<br><br>Hope this is just a case of the trailer not doing the movie justice. Because I like Linklater and I have Dazed and Confused on dvd, one of my favorite films.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitawell that was crAp
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaWow. Baseball, boobs, and beer. If I were straight, I would pre-order a ticket.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitasame director, I know. but this does not feel authentic.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s hoping the movie is not one minute longer than the trailer.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaFinally, a movie about the EARLY 80s, before the neon and New Wave turned it into a day-glo wasteland. People forget it was a totally different culture than a mere 4 years later. That said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll best DAZED; that film is platinum standard.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaIf i want to watch Dazed and Confused, I will watch Dazed and Confused.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaEven if the movie doesn&#39;t succeed the soundtrack probably will. The movie will probably succeed.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaOne thing&#39;s for sure, the soundtrack is on my list. The movie, no so much...
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaOMG Tyler Hoechlin my baby
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaWow this was one of the most pathetic trailers I&#39;ve seen for A LONG TIME.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitalol i read it as everybody wants some trailer
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome ... But how did it get reviews before getting released ?
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaderek left for this üòÇ
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI feel somewhat this is going to be a great a movie..
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaEw... Feels very generic
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s the cocaine
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitathey did a good job showing all the ass in the trailer now i dont have to see it
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaThey should still bring out Wooderson for a cameo.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaDEREEEEEKKKKKKK
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaFeel like if someone remade Animal House.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m quite shocked they did&#39;nt say &quot;From Richard Linklater. The Director of Boyhood&quot;<br>cause you know, it took 12 years to make!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who dislliked this never either lived in or appreciated the 80&#39;s... or the 70&#39;s for that matter.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaomg HOW ... HOW COULD HE BETRAY THE TEEN WOLF FANDOM TO MAKE THUS. ;&#39;[
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaEveryone wants some-
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaMan I love Dazed and Confused and all Richard Linklater&#39;s films I&#39;ve seen so far, but this one looks so... American Pied (at least the trailer makes me think that way)
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitathe actor is like dindi?
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m obsessed with 80s nostalgia! So, even though this takes place in 1980, which might as well still be the 70s, I&#39;m still going to see this ASAP!
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshita70&#39;s nostalgia movies about sex, drugs, and rock n roll are clich√©d, old, and unimaginative. Next.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshita...and one black friend. Sure.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI love Richard Linklater and all but this seems like he is trying to hard to recapture the feel¬†of dazed and confused, I&#39;ll make my mind up after I see the film but I&#39;m just not sure I will like it...
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI guess its not hard to make a movie.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaActors from Teen wolf and glee
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaso &quot;hilarious&quot; ............ LOL
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaWatchmojo is really running out of ideas lol
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaAwesome. Definitely a Dazed &amp; Confused vibe and D&amp;C is the greatest movie ever made.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitato be fair a tail would be awesome

y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitathis actually looks good in my opinion
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitagod this days must o been hard with girls you really had to work. and go find the girls you like and shit wow
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaTyler Hoechlin needs to come back to Teen Wolf and play Derek.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaRichard Linklater one of the most talented directors....<br>Missing Mc Conaghey
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaEvery wants some <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>good movies look elsewhere.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitathe only reason I clicked on this was because Derek from teen wolf was in the movie, now I actually wanna go see this. huh.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI think I&#39;m gonna enjoy this a lot
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s 70&#39;s Show just called....they&#39;re pissed.
y6raUs0CiCQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m very excited for this!

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaugh
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaTo bad¬†Michael Keaton killed the Joker in the first batman movie, that would have made a good live adaptation of the Dark Knight Returns, plus he&#39;s the perfect age now to play an old retired Batman.¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaVery interesting. Very...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitai dont know what the fuck i just watched but i am totally in!!!!!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaYou had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaSo is he supposed to be Birdman the 1960&#39;s winged avenger? I will be disappointed if he isn&#39;t!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaTrailers are allowed to say &quot;shit&quot; and &quot;motherfucker&quot; now? :0<br>Things sure have come a long way since I was a kid...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWow, Zach&#39;s lost some weight!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaNaomi Watts making out with another chick again? I&#39;m already hard.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI dont understand whats happening
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI will definitely see this.¬† Michael Keaton is an amazing actor, and this movie looks equal parts dramatic and hilarious.

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLoL, Man of Steel poster @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a>¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaPerfect cast.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI loved that version of &quot;Don&#39;t let me be misunderstood&quot;! I hope it&#39;s in the movie as well. Also, I&#39;m really excited for this.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWill be first in line for this.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in!!¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitadefinitely one of award season&#39;s most hotly awaited films. Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWhose singing &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; here? It&#39;s not the animals or the version used in Kill Bill¬†

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThies looks way too good to be true D:
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not liking this, SO FAR.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaSong????
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaResonates.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaMichael Keaton needs to use his Birdman voice for all subsequent Batman features, except the animated ones with Kevin Conroy lol.¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie is just Michael Keaton running around in his underwear for 2 hours then  I&#39;m in
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaIm not entirely sure what I just saw.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaCara que coisa rid√≠cula man kkkkk
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s version of Don&#39;t Let Me Be Misunderstood is this?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLooking great! At least... Better than the trailer... Seriously. This contains almost an entire plot. Bad editing guys...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaMaybe you should watch the Movie before you speak, because all your doing is proving that you have no talent and that your idiot, keep it up what a Maroon!¬† LOL
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshita@Benjonic Naomi Watts name is in the credits so...it may well be her.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaSo uh. ¬†Listen. ¬†You get that thing I sentcha?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI saw this mentioned and was eagerly anticipating &quot;Harvey Birdman&quot;....what a disappointment¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing. Perhaps Michael Keaton will finally grab an Oscar.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaMichael Keaton is a very talented actor,as well as underrated.I hope he finds a film where he can show his potential..
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaPls tell me who&#39;s sing this (Don&#39;t let me be misunderstood) song? its a cover!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaBatman got old...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> whats a Man of Steel poster doing there????
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitastill no clue what it&#39;s about - sign of a good trailer?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch anything by inarittu
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it will be highly entertaining! Will definitely be watching this once it hits the screens.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWait...who are the chicks making out?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI was expecting Hannah Barbara.¬†<br><br>FUCK YOU FOX SEARCHLIGHT! YOUR MOVIES SUCK!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitawho sings the cover of don&#39;t let me be Misunderstood from min <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a>¬†

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer for  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Birdman">#Birdman</a> ¬†puts the dark in dark comedy.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaEmma Stone &lt;3
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else feel like there is an underlying message about when Michael Keaton turned down the chance to continue playing batman in the movies?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaEvery shot with a wide angle lens, all but confirming the entire film is an unbroken sequence. Looks batshit crazy. Can&#39;t wait.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLol what in the actual...???
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitathis is the most confusing movie trailer i have ever seen... can&#39;t wait to see the movie.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaLol Man of Steel poster in background at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a>.

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitacant wait ,this movie going to be good, A+ actors like Michael Keaton and Edward Norton¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitais it like¬†men who stare at goats or something????
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaGive to mr. Keaton the Oscar he deserves.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWould rather see a film adaptation of &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law&quot;
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitathe soundtrack for this thing is gonna be epic...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be fucking epic.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaX the Owl ripoff lol
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaSuperman poster at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> !
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaMight as well present Michael Keaton with the Oscar for best actor now, and spare anyone else from getting their hopes up.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaFucking psyched for this movie
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, I was sold in the first 5 seconds.¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaMy most anticipated movie of the rest of the year aside from The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaBirdman, Gone Girl, Inherent Vice, Interstellar etc. 2014 could be a great year! And I saw &quot;Boyhood&quot; a few days ago &amp; it was excellent.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;LL TAKE THE CASE!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a> Man of Steel Poster

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THIS MOVIE
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitageezus....why does this look like its full of so much win?!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaIs not a superhero movie but why still birdman?sound like a superhero film...
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea what I just saw, but I want more.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThis looks very interesting.I will see it.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaSo.. it&#39;s like The Wrestler... but even fucking weirder. No wonder Edward Norton is in this.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThanks fucking god. There was this long argument on a comment on youtube about Zach Galifinakis always playing Alan from hang over. I rebuttal saying that he&#39;s not always Alan in his movies for example It&#39;s Kind of a Funny Story and now this. ¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaKeaton, easily the best Batman and Bruce Wayne!! Can&#39;t wait to see this.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaman of steel poster in the back at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a>

uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThere are reports saying that the whole film will look like a one long take. I need to see this!!!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThat one slide where they list Keaton, Norton, Galifinakis, Stone, Watts, Risborough. That&#39;s enough for me. I&#39;m in.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to Michael Keaton
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaI bet in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a> that was actually real when they were literally filming the scene and they thought it would be funny for the film lmao
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThe Man of Steel banner in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a>¬†
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshita&quot;YEAH!&quot; at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> is gonna be everyone&#39;s reaction to this film, I&#39;m betting.
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaHey, whats the name of the song?
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaWho did this cover of the song &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;?? Anybody know? 
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaUnreal, can&#39;t wait!!!
uJfLoE6hancdelimeterByIshitaThis seems cool!!!

5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitastrange when someone not from ballet is playing a ballet dancer....
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaI cam see that not a lot of thought has gone into this movie I mean I&#39;m a ballet dancer myself and the world of dance is bitchy and there are struggles along the way and sometimes a dancer even dies from starving herself to death but this film shows absolute bullshit it makes all us dancers look like psychopaths and that we&#39;re willing to basically die for a role this is absolute bullshit
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathe topic doesnt interest me much, but its got got Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis
Definite will see
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaNatalie Portman in balerina clothes?  I already have a hand down my pants and now I see a lesbian scene with her and Mila Kunis??!!  
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@TomFuIp you&#39;re not Tom Fulp!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@moo22productions NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita1:37 masturbating!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaohhhhhhhh my god. I&#39;ve been waiting since The Wrestler for another masterpiece by Aronofsky. I know this one won&#39;t let me down. Plus CLINGT FUCKING MANSELL!?!?!?! Amazing writing and score team.  Darren Aronofsky + Clint Mansell = Pure. Genius.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLooks strange.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLOVE Darren Aronofsky! one of the best directors of the decade
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitakiller ending
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome! but i dont usually like mila kunis acting though she seems like a nice girl in interviews and i love her work on family guy and that 70&#39;s show.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazzinnnnnnnng !
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaI love Natalie! She&#39;s one of the best actresses and my personal favourites. 
It would be a great movie.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaWINONA RYDER NEEDS MORE THAN ONE SECOND IN THIS TRAILER
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitai want to see this!... right now!!! 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaomg are those wing signs on her back then?
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaAronofsky you are one talented crazy man!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaBallet bullshit. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis kissing. Im so conflicted.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaOMG...can&#39;t wait to see!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLooks really promising and the score by the most awesome Clint Mansell sounds already very magnificent!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaoh my god. that disturbing
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLook amazing! Cant wait to see it! Just a shame the release date is so bloody far away! 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaWow! Can&#39;t wait for this.
And I must add that I love what Mila Kunis is doing with her career.

5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaholy shit looks creepy as hell
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitashe&#39;s becoming a swan???
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaWTF. Natalie Portman just makes me want to cry. Idk why, but she does. 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaat the end of the trailer.... did she really change 2 a swan or just hallucination ? 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@jvizzle17 + winona ryder too  really must see!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathe last few seconds seriously scared me. 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaread the script to this last september - it&#39;s truly amazing, one of the best i&#39;ve ever read! can&#39;t wait to see it on screen!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaBitch, watch out for Larry David!!!!!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaHow can i be turned on and creeped the fuck out of at the same time?
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@alfredoiceman exactly
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita–ê.–•.–£.–ï.–¢.–¨.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaAronofsky, enough said.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaJust by looking at the scene where Kunis and Portman make out, i can confidently say this will most likely go down as the greatest movie ever made in human history. 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s Tyler Durden?
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be twisted! Must see!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be in my bunk.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaHoly SHNICKY APPLESAUCE ON A STICK! I must see this film NAO! NAO!!!! RElease already! NAO!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks sick and that&#39;s why it&#39;s gonna be good.
I hope Natalie&#39;s gonna get an Oscar already!!!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaMeg Griffin and Queen Amidala... interesting :P
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic. Goosebumps!

Portman is gold. 


5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathis looks lovingly dark and seductive cant wait to see it!~!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great.  
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaNice
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@AlexDeLargeisHere agreed. but who knows if it&#39;ll be as good as either...
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@essyayen YES
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaWOW looks CRAZYYY, big fan of Portman! I truly can not wait for this film I hope its not a disappointment but both Requiem and The Wrestler were great so not too worried! 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaumm...did natalie portman and mila kunis just hook up? wheres the todd when you need him :P
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathis film has my 10.50 thanks to the Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis sex scene

5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaNot a ballet fan, but wow.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitadude that looks kinda retartedly gay 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaI heard of this one because I&#39;m a big Natalie Portman fan, but it looks like there&#39;s a lot of reasons to watch this one.  The images alone are amazing--when Natalie&#39;s reflection turns to stare at her, it&#39;s beautiful and creepy at the same time.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaholy shit! this looks AWESOME!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@trentWHY 
um yeah keep those thoughts to yourself while you&#39;re in bed....

5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@trentWHY 
From what I read about this movie it will be pretty crazy.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitawow this is dark. I might see it.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaFINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThey should just advertise this as 
&quot;hardcore lesbian sex scene&quot;
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitawhoa.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita1:26
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaHoly balls its Kafka+Aronofsky
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaaronofsky = must watch
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaboring
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitamila AND natalie. Too much hotness in this one movie. =O
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitai have been waiting so long for this!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaAronofsky never makes the same movie twice!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@imthenervouswreckful I don&#39;t know but that would be crazy cool!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaamazing trailer! Love natalie... I heard that Vicent is a former dancer, can&#39;t wait to see him in this film. 
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaim a dancer and i love ballet, i also love darren aronofsky so this is going to be FUCKING AMAZING. and natalie portman is my FAVORITE actress. couldn&#39;t be a more fucking perfect combination. im so excited.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshita@muselabs Clint Mansell :)
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. Will watch (Y)
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaAnxiety Attacks! Very well portrayed.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaomg! i really need to watch it!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitathis looks so cool...cant wait to see it..
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaThis will be the best film of the year.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaSo she turns into a bird? What?
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitareally good
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitacould be amazing! gonna watch it
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaTHUMBS UP FOR BALLET!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaso she literally turns into a black swan?
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitawow, this looks brilliant. I love dark dramas, and the fact that it is about ballet is a plus, (not that I&#39;m necessarily a fan of ballet), but it obviously adds to the competition and rivalry in the movie. This is one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Portman and Kunis look stunning. Can&#39;t wait. It&#39;ll be one of the best dramas of the year. I&#39;m sure Portman will be up for a nomination.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like they re-wrote Showgirls into a ballet horror movie ^.^ Looks interesting tho.
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitaINSANE!!!!!!!!!!
5jaI1XOB-bsdelimeterByIshitatHIS LOOKS LIKE LIKE IS GOING TO BE A VERY DARK FILM!!

YLorLVa95XodelimeterByIshitamaybe only made for the movie.
YLorLVa95XodelimeterByIshitahulk buster ftw!
YLorLVa95XodelimeterByIshitaI think the whole extremis armor will end up being a mistake and he will end up controlling the suits the old fashion way. If not then they are just making Iron Man to powerful.

YLorLVa95XodelimeterByIshitai think seeing as how this movie takes place after the avengers it was probably a precaution against the hulk.

yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIron Man , Mark Ruffalo and Mysterio in the same movie
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaBy far the most frustrating movie I‚Äôve ever seen. The lack of this modern day technology is what made this movie. Also I don‚Äôt get why any money was put into creating this movie, what was the point?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaBest true-crime movie ever?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaSo, a couple of things<br><br>1. The survivor seen the killer (which he later identified was Leigh). Why didn‚Äôt they ask the survivor to positively ID him sooner?<br><br>2. Why would that not be enough evidence for an arrest?<br><br>3. And if Darlene‚Äôs friend (the one in prison) seen Leigh during the painting party why couldn‚Äôt they just tell her to positively ID him from a photo?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitahehe iron man hulk mysterio üòé
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWhen I finish Mindhunter I‚Äôm gonna have to watch this
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaBest investigation movie
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watched this movie today. I don&#39;t know what to sat but i&#39;m freaking nervous until now. Well it&#39;s so so great ‚ù§üëç
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaHere after endgame and far from home
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaid 100% recommend its a really good movie plus it has marvel actors soo
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitathe science bros and mysterio
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThe most dangerous game
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWhats The Song at The and
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaTed Cruz
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWhy didn‚Äôt Iron man and Hulk just team up and blast the zodiac to pieces.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaSo multiverse really exist <br>Ironman Hulk and Mysterio is on mission üî•
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThanos must of used the reality stone again and told Quentin Beck and decided to work with him to get back at Tony Stark and Bruce for returning all the Avengers üòÇ
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaHow can anyone forget when Iron man, and hulk decided to work with mysterio to find the zodiac killer?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitalol
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitai havent watched the film, but the trailer was enough to spoil everything for me. Idk if im correct or not but ik whos the killer and whats the storyline goiing to be.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThe zodiac has probably watched this movie himself ü§£
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitai got traumas watching this movie in my teenage years man that stabbing scene was real scary
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIron Man, Hulk &amp; Mysterio
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaEven Tony and Bruce were tricked by Mysterio. Jokes aside, these three actors are excellent and I enjoyed this movie a lot.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôm about to watch this for the first time
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitajust please explain to me .What does the ending mean?? Is he lee allen or the zodiac are 4 men?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThe 2 OG Avengers and The Fake Avenger.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIRON MAN, HULK, FRICKING MYSTERIO?!?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitafirst I was like what!!! when I saw Mark in the thumbnail. Then I see Jake in the trailer, then RDJ. AND THEY ARE ACTING IN A MOVIE ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN HISTORY. obviously this person was very bad and I 3000 percent DO NOT support mass murders, i just liked the story THAT IS IT.  <br>but seriously though, I found this trailer very interesting.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitame and my boys
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitatorrents forever !
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIron man, hulk and Mysterio walk into a bar

yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaNobody:<br><br>Everyone who commented: <b>IRON MAN HULK MYSTERIO</b>
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Ted Cruz had a movie made about him.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here only for Robert Downey Jr
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIRoN mAn, HuLk, mysTerIO<br><br>UHXHDHEJEJDBDJEJEH

yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThese iron man,hulk and mysterio comments are too good hahahahahahaha
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIron Man, Hulk and Myserio?
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaBaby Thanos kill them ..üòÇ
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshita‚ù§üí™
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI am iron man
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a storyline
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitarot in hell since you couldnt rot in prison
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI have a podcast called Weird on the Rocks and I did a 3 part Zodiac Killer series. Go check it out!
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI bet the Zodiac killer went to watch this movie.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t they just use there powers to stop the zodiac killer
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWoah 3 avengers üòç
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaYour presence in art makes me question
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIron man and hulk
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshita<i>This is a nice crossover</i>
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI came here for Robert Downey jr and then found mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal üòÇüòÇ 3 characters in the marvel universe üòÇ
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThis is a brilliant film, worth watching more than once. They kept the facts and acted perfectly. Arthur leigh Allan saying If he &quot;was the Zodiac he certainly wouldnt tell the police&quot;... Chilling
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaSuch an amazing experience of a movie. <br>But a little creepy at times
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI come to see the trailer of zodiac and I see comments saying Tony stark, Bruce banner and Mysterio
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaDude that stabbing scene was brutal
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIt truly was a great movie.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe that Iron Man, Hulk and Mysterio was in the same film.. Now I know.. It feels great
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaSo.. that&#39;s what <b>Tony Stark</b> ,  <b>Bruce Banner</b> and <b>Quentin Beck</b> were doing in the alternate universe/dimension.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshita1.11 please someone tell me the name of the song that begins here.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI come here to see comments about Hulk, Iron Man and Mysterio.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitascary
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitagreat movie
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie based on true story the man exist and  FBI dont know who he was up to know
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaIts the science bro&#39;s everybody
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaNice movie but in hindi dubbed
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a coincidence, two avengers
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaFincher&#39;s best ever movie. Should have won plenty of Oscars.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI just watch the movie becauce of Robert downey junior
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaInteresting music choice for the trailer
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaThe film is a lot more scarier than this trailer. It used to haunted me for weeks in my teenage years....
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshita....and THEN comes the Monster podcast about Zodiac and blows up everything you thought was true about the case.  It‚Äôs not my quest in life to prove that ALA was not the true Zodiac, so please don‚Äôt beat me up over that (the movie‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm sure), but it‚Äôs based on the word of the Zodiac book author, and apparently he was far less than honest about the evidence. There are people interviewed in the podcast that are like, ‚ÄúGraysmith‚Äôs book claims that we had a conversation but that just never happened.‚Äù Not to mention that the palm prints didn‚Äôt really match and there was lots of total misinformation circulated by the book, such as the accusation that ALA‚Äôs family thought he did it and turned him in (completely untrue). Sounds like the case wasn‚Äôt even almost solved and an innocent man (though apparently a strange one) was hounded for 50 years.
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaMysterio, Ironman, and Hulk in one movie
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaI got interested in Zodiac and started reading more about it,  the killings and stuff and then came across this movie... <br>God they used the original words of the letter, the thing about the killing school children, the TV thing.... <br>üòçüòçüòçüòç
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaMark &amp; Robert once again in one team and use their brain to solve a case üòÇ well they really a smart Team
yNncHPl1UXgdelimeterByIshitaHulk,iron man,prince of Persia and the man from earth . How can you not give it a watch!!!!

nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitareally not thrilled with Rhino...would rather have the old version, but my ass will still be parked in the theater opening day...what as the suit next to Doc Octopus?¬†
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaSPOILERS ALERT: End credits scene of this movie involves Avengers 2
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaCgi effect is terrible .. i prefer  spiderman sam raimi&#39;s version
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaLooks really false. Bad CGI.
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaNow this is a spider-man movie
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaEPIC
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaUnderwhelming.<br>I had enough of this &#39;Untold Story&#39; 2 minutes into the first film.<br>Find ways of getting Spider-Man into the actual good Marvel Universe, then Avengers 3.<br>Right now, it&#39;s ridiculous that he&#39;s in a New York where Tony Stark&#39;s &#39;Avengers&#39; building doesn&#39;t exist.
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaChills
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaamazing, but it looks like a videogame ..
nbp3Ra3Yp74delimeterByIshitaIv&#39;e seen better CGI from video games. Its just looks too cartoon-y.

k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita0:34 amityville
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaI want to see this, and Patrick Wilson being in it also is a bonus :D
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaFuck...
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaQue lokoo!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaAWESOME
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitasame shit over and over eh. nothing is there...nothing is there..wait for it. BOO! audience jumps...rinse..repeat..collect the money from the sheep. :) i agree with ya. 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaWhat song is it ?

k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaTwilight baby in this Movie!!!!!!  
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaYES!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaomg
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitabased on a true story ?!

k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaNina brought me here!  :)
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaHollywood please! Enough with the stereotypical jump scare; creepy child; haunted house; woman in dirty night gown; leg pulling; angry spirit; little child first to see ghost; people refusing to leave house even though all sorts if shot happens, ghost story
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaif not a haunting nor possession then what? interesting.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaYes.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaNot quite.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaI dont know if i can do this. 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaI edited a tv show that featured Lorraine Warren.  She is a shyster.  No matter where she was, she always picked up on &quot;dark spirits&quot;.  Funny that in the trailer she says verbatim what I heard her say time and time again.  Something awful always happened where she was taken to pick up on psychic energy.  If you took her to Disneyland, it would be the most miserable place on Earth to her.  She is a joke.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaCreepy face on tree 1:03

also I&#39;m PRETTY sure thats the Amityville horror house.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaOkay this move actually looks pretty scary

and vera farmiga..damn shes hot
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaare you crazy, this is definitely a job for the,
Ghostfacers
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaTime to call Sam and Dean!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaBased on actual events my ass. 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita&quot;you&#39;ll see him behind you&quot;

Little lying bitch...
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaPro tip, 
Imagine you are sexuly attracted to whatever scars you. ; )
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitathats ok i didn&#39;t wanna sleep
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaCant wait for this one.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaI would do her
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis guy must have had a really rape-y childhood.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaMan fuck!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaNina Dobrev brought me here... :)

k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaSaw this trailer on the sidebar. Though it was ok to watch because its during the day time. Holy fuck was I wrong.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaReally creepy, turn up the volume &quot;look what she made me do&quot;  @2:19
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaLove Lorraine Warren an awesome demonologist!!!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita2:10 Horrible voice over editing.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaOoooo not something new
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaIts Donovan - Hurdy Gurdy Man (played in Fincher&#39;s Zodiac too)
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaNinaaaaa!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitashe tweeted this :)
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitalooks like Amityville of Horror, very similar!!.... aww!!! my baby Mackenzie Foy! &lt;3
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaWhat does Nina Dobrev have to do with this movie?
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t need to know who you are to tell you that the human brain is not the pinnacle of observation as our species would like to think which is why we invented instruments to extend our senses. i.e radio telescopes
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaHAHAHHA i am truly laughing at you while reading your text ya dont even know my name but you think  you know enough about me to say i have an unreliable brain... thats rich... i have nothing more to say to u
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitai guarantee you&#39;ve had extrasensory experiences but because they are personal and not measurable or observable or repeatable they do not exist in any sort of scientific reality and are no more than the result of an imperfect and unreliable brain 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitawhat kind of dumb superstitions do you mean? that energy dont exist? that their is no such thing as a human soul(wether it be good or evil)? cause if thats what you mean you NEVER want to experience half of what i have
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaYes, Mackenzie Foy 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitayes, Mackenzie Foy
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitathis will be good
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaSomeone please tell me what the name of the song is at the beginning of the trailer. 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaIs the little girl Renesmee?
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitawut a fucking god omg im gona watch this 1 finaly they made a good freaking movie
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitathis kind of movie only reinforces dumb superstitions and they make me angry
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaYup
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaat first it looked stupid, and then i kinda died a little.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaok, so i&#39;m turning on the lights in every room from now on.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaomg omg omg
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be good but there is a problem with the plot. Since it is them telling a story about something they have ALREADY EXPERIENCED we know that they live through it and don&#39;t lose any limbs or anything. In a horror, I need to feel attatched to character and like I can be killed at anytime, this feeling will be gone if the story is a recount.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaAt the eni sead HOLY SH$# HOLY S@$#  WHAT THE F|$#
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaKimi.bitumen j
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaGREAT horror doesn&#39;t come from what you see, it&#39;s all in what you DON&#39;T see
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitahahahahahahahahahahaha

no
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaSooo, this is kinda like Paranormal Activity?
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaDelicious :]
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaGREAT.. Mackenzie is on there but this shit seems creepy LOLOL!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaIsnt that the girl from twilight? Who became bella&#39;s daughter?
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitac cool si nina regarde ce genre de film elle de tr√®s bon gout il n&#39;y a rien de mieux qu&#39;un bon films d&#39;horreur 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis will be better than Evil Dead,
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaInsidious 1.5 with a different storyline.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaMackenzie Foy and Vera Farmiga are in this! I so have to see this
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThank you, Nina Dobrev, for bringing me here and scare the shit out of me :D
Excited to see this movie! :)
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaAzn movies are the scariest
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitanever seen it :) but thanks I&#39;ll check it up :D
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitahahahhahaha well done! 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitai&#39;m probably gonna get thumbs down 4 this buuuuut 1:30 renesme &lt;3
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitahaha i want to see!

k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaOmg I will see that! Awesome horror film I think that&#39;s rare!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaSame but wish i never did. Scared :S
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita0:30 please what song is playing?
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis is not scary.. It&#39;s just the sound and the sudden moves that gets u to be &quot;scared&quot;. nothing much.. nothing scary here..
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaanother good horror movie is   &quot;The Grave Encounters&quot; 1&amp;2
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis looks freaking scary, thank you Nina, good thrillers are hard to find these days!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita0:39 Who remembers &quot;Eleanor&quot; from The Haunting , 1999? :)) 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaMe three!! :D
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaoh hell to the no! i just shat my pants!!!! 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitascariest 3 minutes of my life
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita0:50 thought they were gonna start doing the harlem shake
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshita2:21 ERRRGHH! WHY WERE YOU BORN?!?!?!?!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here because of Nina Dobrev :D lol
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitawell my opinion is that, there are no movies scarier than &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and the Old Classic Horror movies. it seems no one today knows how to make a scary movie, and its really sad. this trailer seems good though but nothing special.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaheeheee same!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaNina Dobrev brought me here:P!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitayou&#39;re not the only one who made that mistake....
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaHey Nina &lt;3
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t watched a great horror film in ages.  This looks like it may be the one.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaHated myself watching this trailer with a headset at 3am in the dark. Shizer!!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaWho agrees that this will be the best horror movie this year 
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaFor me, James Wan‚Äôs films have a habit of having great build-ups and then eventually showing and explaining way too much which totally weakens the scare factor. Insidious was great until the last half an hour in which it got so dumb and flashy. The trailers for this have been great so far, I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm willing to go to the cinema to see it considering how many times I‚Äôve been let-down before.
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitafreakin awesome!!!
k10ETZ41q5odelimeterByIshitaThis is why James Wan IS the greatest Horror Director working today.
