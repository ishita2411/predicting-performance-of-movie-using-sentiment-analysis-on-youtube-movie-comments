yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaNot related to cloverfield, this is just a marketing tactic.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaNow this is a trailer. Doesn&#39;t reveal much at all.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so confused. This isn&#39;t anything like Cloverfield.<br>Although it would be interesting for the sequel to not be found footage, this seems so different.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaThey ina bunker a kaiju cant follow them down there ...it be like peeking down doorway going &quot;come on out so I can explode ur heads U_U &quot;
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaIncreible!!! Que gran sorpresa nos dieron!!! Y falta muy poco para su estreno en el que estaré ahí!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so surprised that this was kept quiet for so long. Really looking forward to the movie!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaomfg! I&#39;m over here all giddy as a school girl. my sis and I have checked every few months since 2008 to see if he was ever going to start a sequel and I can&#39;t believe he did and did it in secret! come on March hurry up and get here!!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI have been waiting eight years for this moment.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaKept me waiting J.J. Kept me fucking waiting. <br>Going to be interesting to see how this one turns out, considering how different to the original it looks. At the very least, I hope it&#39;s an entertaining movie.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI bet she saw Jack and Locke coming to her shelter at the end of this trailer. There&#39;s not other explanation for that facial expression. I would react the same way if I see the man of science and the man of faith coming to my shelter.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song in the trailer?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaThought the lights out earthquake type thing was Goodman darting,how wrong I was
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWell this came out of nowhere! I&#39;m super hyped! :D
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaJoin the original Cloverfield IMDB Viral hunting crew at the 10 Cloverfield Lane message board (IMDB).  We have a thread dedicated to new Cloverfield viral content.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaLord of secrecy!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaSomeone can tell me the dialogue of this trailer, please?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaSeriously out of nowhere! Loved Cloverfield, especially the ad campaign and viral marketing the movie had. Can&#39;t wait for this! As much as I no longer care for the found footage genre,  Cloverfield was one of the few ones I liked/loved. And this movie is out in just 2 months? Holy shit. JJ is killin&#39; it lately! And the guy who wrote Whiplash wrote this as well.  Hype!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaLove the way they use that song.  Never really considered how creepy the lyrics could be.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaJ.J. Abrams is a master at marketing, all the STAR WARS 7 trailers didn&#39;t reveal the movie&#39;s story and I still remember seeing the trailer for SUPER 8 and not knowing a single thing about the movie. Same with STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (even though that backfired on him, gotta give him credit
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI AM FUCKING PUMPED FOR THIS FILM
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;VE WAITED SO FUCKING LONG FOR THIS!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaif we look at the last movie, we can assume that the first 20-30 minutes takes place in their bunker until she goes to open the door. Upon closer inspection, the camera is over her shoulder while she looks through the window, it looks like a person in a yellow quarantine type suit with a flashlight. check it out for yourself, pause it, its definitely a person she&#39;s looking at.<br><br>also really thrilled about it not being found footage.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitasong?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaLol everyone was so caught up in Star Wars that we didn&#39;t even think about anything else...
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaTHANK YOU J.J. ABRAMS!!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaFuck Star Wars. This is what I wanted. This is what I needed. I&#39;m ready nigga. I&#39;m <b>READY</b>. 8 fucking years, I&#39;ve been waiting. Shoutout to my homie HUD. <br>&#39;,
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitatake note Mary Elizabeth Winstead&#39;s character has a modern day phone unlike the ones seen in Cloverfield. Not sure if that means anything
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitasaw this trailer during 13 Hours and it blew my mind. Can&#39;t wait!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWhat if that character is Teddy Hansen, the guy who was missing in the first Cloverfield marketing campaign?!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaYES! I still remember the day I saw Cloverfield, a bird shit on me that day. Good times
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI LOVED the first one. But the first one was &#39;found footage&#39;, POV. This one is multi-camera third person. It really, 100% f**ks me off that they think this is acceptable. They created a world, now deal with the consequences of filming within it. I&#39;ll be downloading an illegal copy because that&#39;s now all it&#39;s worth :) <br><br>Cheers Hollywood, you utter shites.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna try and solve this mystery.... <br><br>10 cloverfield lane is a sequel to cloverfield it but it&#39;s not cloverfield 2. so 10 -2 is 8. That&#39;s how many years it&#39;s been since the first film that&#39;s been released.  the first film was released on January 18th the sequel is released on March 11. 18 - 11 is 7.  now subtract the 8 and 7 and you get 1. Now a clover has many leaves but most people are familiar with four so 4 - 1 is 3.... Oh God! It has been confirmed. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a code word for Half Life 3 Confirmed. Gabe you sneaky Magnificent  Bastard. Or it just could be all mubo jumbo. anyways I&#39;m hyped.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone see whats in the reflection of hey eyes near the end of the trailer? Also, what did the VHS/Book the bearded guy have say? Cannibal Airlines? Is this Abrams doing his thing again?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a whale!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaNow what if this door is actually a hatch? ...
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWhat a twist. So we didn&#39;t see what exactly is coming. And Winestead was in Cloverfield and died if I remember right. So what if they double twist us and this has nothing to do with Cloverfield and Cloverfield is an anthology for supernatural movies
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaHype.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaCould numbers 4,8,3 in the beginning mean anything?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaThere is no way this movie can disappoint me. I&#39;m so excited! 😭
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitabut here&#39;s the problem:<br>Where&#39;s the websites? the pictures? the dumbass MySpace accounts??<br>I NEED THAT!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t looked at all the comments yet to speculate with my fellow fans but.... &quot;IT&#39;S A LION!&quot;
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaHonestly the most RANDOM HEADLINE that could have possibly been posted online lmfaoooo but I am PUMPED for this!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaTrailer didnt tell us shit..
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaIt has been a long 8 years, I never thought this day would come😂😂😂😂
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaCan this be?????? Fuuuuu i&#39;m getting excited
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaYes.<br><br><br>Yes.<br><br>Now, in which direction do I throw my money to get this movie?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaHow in the FUCK does one keep this a secret for so long?!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaDid Anyone remember Lost?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaHooray for more Cloverfield action!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaEight year olds, Dude.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaanything with j.j. abrams as director deserves a like from me.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaOh man I can&#39;t wait.. Sneaky..very sneaky Mr Abrams. Now I need some Slusho..
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Desmond?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaTrailer reminds me of the start of Lost series two, with Desmond in the hatch.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaDan Trachtenberg!!!! Woot!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaThank you Bad Robot, thank you...
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaGREAT BRAINS IN A BLENDER IT&#39;S FINALLY HAPPENING
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading all these comments, and I have a question: What if it&#39;s not a Cloverfield Sequel?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaMy quick unprocessed theories first theories:<br>1. 10 cloverfield lane is another military project code name.<br>2. 10 cloverfield lane is the area in which the military named the project code name from the first movie. That&#39;s where the bunker is at 10 cloverfield lane. Or something significant happened at 10 cloverfield lane like the monster died there or the leveling Nuke landed there or something like that.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a shit like the first?
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitathe first one was freaking awesome!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitamy prayers have been answered
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWow
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaReminds of the opening scene of season 2 of Lost with Desmond in the hatch. The JJ Abrams connection.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaBudget: My left foot :v It says so in the Wikipedia. That Abrams is a troll master!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshita8 years ago I bought into the hype of 1/18/08. It was a GREAT experience. I can&#39;t wait to see where this goes...
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI knew it
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaJJ you sneaky bastard.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaComing out in a few months! JJ you sneaky bastard!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaAccording to the first movie, there was a &#39;&#39;Hammer-down protocol&#39; which involved a total evacuation from NYC and some nuclear or hydrogen bombs. It will be interesting to know how people survived to this and could be able to build such comfortable refugees.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaMYSTERY MARKETING IS THE BEST.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaDANK
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaIM SO ODDLY INTRIGUED!!!!!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI remember following the Cloverfield project since its first mysterious trailer simply titled 1-18-08. Not only did the movie live up to the hype, it kept me wanting for me, looking up any signs for a sequel or <i>something</i>.<br><br>1-18-08. Eight years later. I&#39;m fucking hyped. Time to enjoy a cup of Slusho!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M PERCHED!<br><br>JJ, BAD ROBOT, HOW DARE YALL FUCKING SLAY LIKE THIS?? Y&#39;all have got some damn nerve to just drop this movie on us like this!<br>I AM SCREAMING!!!!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaFight the power! Nice surprise.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaMan the guy from Whiplash wrote this? We&#39;re in for something special.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitajust wow. just give me the movie
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshita&quot;It&#39;s a lion!&quot; :P
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWooh! Glad it&#39;s not found footage.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaLooks brilliant
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaIf you ask me it looks like the bunker has been built in like a subway station or something, there&#39;s some kind of street name on the bricks as she&#39;s walking up. I&#39;ve never been to New York or ever ridden a subway before but just really jumped out to me as that. Which would make sense since the first movie took place there. Perhaps it&#39;s a monster overran wasteland or something.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaBooked it out of the theater once I saw it. Glad I got to see it in theaters and was completely shocked. Went to google it and nothing had been posted yet.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWebsite ain&#39;t workin&#39; at this juncture, Paramount.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaMy body is ready!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaCloverfeild was the REAL monster from lost before the writer&#39;s strike happened just sayin
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaDan becomes a sneak sneaky man! :)

yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Something&#39;s coming&quot; - there was definitely something coming out of my dick when I saw the &#39;Cloverfield&#39; title. God damn.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;ve been waiting for a sequel, this is awesome.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaJJ Abrams you son of a bitch. You made Star Wars just to distract us from this, DIDNT YOU???
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaOmfg what does it mean???? Need more
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaJJ Abrams: the maestro of marketing. Unbelievably HYPED!
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitalooking forward to seeing this.
yQy-ANhnUpEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think a trailer has given me such a tense, haunting feeling of dread in such a long time, looking forward to this.

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAubrey Plaza makes me rethink my sexuality
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaIf I had a sister and she married a black dude, there&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;m going to the wedding without packing an m-4.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnna!!! love her so so much😍😍😍😍😍😍

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m down...Aubrey Plaza is always an eye treat.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI am surprised how stupid this movie looks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MikeAndDave">#MikeAndDave</a>
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33MtR-g4Jcg&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a>?

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitamy type of movie😏
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaIs this the movie my babe Andrea Russet is in??
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaThe bbc agenda continues
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaKendrick + Plaza is life.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnybody but me think Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are gonna out-funny these guys throughout the whole thing ? &#39;cause&#39;, that&#39;s kinda what it looks like.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, this looks super funny, can&#39;t wait until it comes out :)
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for Anna Kendrick
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitapause at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33MtR-g4Jcg&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33MtR-g4Jcg&amp;t=2m01s">2:01</a>
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnother flop Zac?
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaMr Efron is wasting his potential.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaZac seems to be doing a lot of movies lately. Though the movies are all quite similar I have to give him credit for staying relevant unlike the other HSM stars... He really needs to try some more dramatic roles though. I&#39;ll still see this to support him lol.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaZac is going overboard with working out. He&#39;s getting /too/ muscle-y...
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnna and Aubrey = yay!!! Adam and Zac = nay...
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitathis actually seems really funny. can&#39;t wait to see these four actors play off of each other. plus Zac needs a break.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaFinally Adam Devine is a Main Character.. he deserves his own movie.. he&#39;s funny as hell.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaIs Ders and Blake gonna be in this?!
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick...Aubrey Plaza...#ImFuckingIn
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI love Zac but he continues to play the same character. (Neighbors, Dirty Grandpa, That Awkward Moment, and now Mike and Dave)
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitawatched with aunts all thought that  the trailerit was funny but in a sick way
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaomg Zac Efrons shirt was on for the whole trailer!!!
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitawould only watch this for aubrey and anna
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitai like these 4 people so much<br><br>cant wait
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaSo excited to see this movie!! Kendrick and Plaza are the ultimate dream team, and Zac and Adam are really funny too, so this should be interesting.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaSooooooooo, basically Wedding Crashers with females crashing the wedding?
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitathis...actually looks funny
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaNot sure how I feel about this...
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s weird that Anna Kendrick was nominated for an Oscar but it&#39;s Zac that have super high expectations about his career just because he did some cheesy dramas like &quot;Charlie st. Cloud&quot; and &quot;The Lucky One&quot;, using that as a parameter I&#39;m pretty sure his career is not &quot;worse&quot; now
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaew.. aubrey plaza has zero butt.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really bad but also really good
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaBurn... victim... Barbie... YES lol.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAubrey Plaza is neither funny nor attractive. Please stop.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaConfirmed Aubrey Plaza is blowing Zack Efron.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitalooks so stupid. I&#39;m definitively going to watch it idhdubdudbd

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaWho cares if Zac keeps doing the same shitty movies? Everyone is going to watch this for Anna and Aubrey.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so, so bad. None of the leads have comic chops, how did this get past stage 1?
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI love this!!!! I&#39;m so excited to see the movie

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI just hope the good lord gives me the fortitude and strength to hold out till this gets released.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaanNA FREAKING KENDRICK <br><br>also Anna and Aubrey= dream team

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaLooked a bit like siones wedding
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaThe most amazing friendship of Anna and Aubrey.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaZac Efron is slowly becoming like Adam Sandler.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitathis kind of looks perfect. at least the trailer is perfect

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaTwo of those just came from a horrible movie <br><br>Im still gonna watch it lol
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAnna kendrick and Audrey plaza are the MVP of this trailer.
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAubrey Plaza is FIIIIIIIIIIINEEEEE

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaAubrey Plaza marry me

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitaI am looking at Aubrey plaza throughout the trailer. The teacher character suits her well.

33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshita2nd
33MtR-g4JcgdelimeterByIshitafirst
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSo she is following her sisters footsteps in how to become a sadist
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaOk, this looks interesting, but I didn&#39;t see Keanu at all. What character does he play? Elle looks wonderful! It&#39;ll be different to see her as a killer.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaKEANU WHERE ARE YOU ?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaNicolas!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Black Swan. Where&#39;s Keanu?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaTo those who wonder where is Keanu Reeves. He is at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipOTUO0CmU&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipOTUO0CmU&amp;t=1m16s">1:16</a> in the dark.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaThe colours and the lighting are orgasmic
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitawho here liked only God forgives? I loved drive to
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSong?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSo fappable already, and this is just the trailer!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitasooo wtf is this about??
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s quite nice picture art. i&#39;m not sure about the story though.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSubtitle says Keanu Reeves but I don&#39;t see him.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaShould&#39;ve kept it Neon Demon.  The &quot;The&quot; here is contrived and, dare I say, pretentious.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaKeanu Reeves?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD YES
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaanother black swan!? @@
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWell this film looks .... shit!!!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaplease be better than Only god forgives.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaTake a deep breath... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipOTUO0CmU&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a>
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWhere was Keanu in the trailer.?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaIt looks gorgeous.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaIt is clear that Keanu Reeves has perfected his ninja abilities cause I didn&#39;t see him in this trailer. If you did see him please point him out for me?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshita1 second of a shadowed Keanu??!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaThe Black Swann: Modelling Edition
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWhy is Keanu Reeves not in the trailer and how can this be a horror movie?!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipOTUO0CmU&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> WTF??!! did she bite her? Is she drinking her blood?!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cipOTUO0CmU&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a> A freaking mountain lion?! <br>It&#39;s gonna a wild ride
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSo where is Keanu Reeves in all this?...
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like total crap! &amp; I don&#39;t even think I seen Keanu in the trailer so wtf? lol
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, trailer of the week.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitawtf is this really supposed to be a horror?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaEven if it&#39;s not going to be the best movie, it sure as hell is going to look nice at the very least. It intrigues me even more considering they didn&#39;t really show Keanu Reeves in the trailer. Should be a spooky spooky good time.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitahuh?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWell that escalated quickly.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWhen trailers give away the whole plot: &quot;oh for fuck&#39;s sake you&#39;ve ruined the movie!&quot;<br><br>When trailers keep the plot a secret: &quot;oh for fuck&#39;s sake I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening so it must be a shit movie!&quot;<br><br>The internet defined.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI love the minimalism in this
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitawtf was that
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaThis is giving me some serious black swan vibes
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaHorror Movie? A joke? Haha that&#39;s Funny !!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitathis movie kind of reminds me of Starry Eyes not Black Swan.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitathe dangerous women music video looks lit come tru ari!!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSeemed interesting and visually stunning and I still have no clue what the plot is... Basically, exactly what a trailer is supposed to be. :)
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWell, it&#39;s got two actors in supporting roles that I really like: Christina Hendricks and Desmond Harrington.  Think the first place I remember Harrington from was <i>&#39;Ghost Ship&#39;</i>, a disappointing film but kinda cool to have him as a &quot;Devil&#39;s Apprentice&quot; type character.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaNope!!!!!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this right now
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSo this is what The Dag did before the apocalypse.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s some kind of evil Zelda... Upside down triforce in the final shot.... They didn&#39;t show keanu because he&#39;s gunna be Link and that&#39;s a big reveal for later
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaPros: i like the actress, its seems that will be really amazing about screening and visuals, nothing really shows and says in trailer<br>Cons: Bswan 2.0 at first sight, but! i like the BS so didnt think its bad about it. And i sure that its not so similar to it
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI love all of his movies and i can&#39;t wait for this one. That cinematography and this music is hypnotic and magical.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t see Keanu in the trailer... so if he is there, it must be not that memorable... not going to watch it.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSuspiria meets Black Swan.I&#39;m so freaking ready
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaYou have Keanu Reeves and you don&#39;t show him!? 😒
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshita- I know kung fuuuuu
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaBlack Swan: Neon Dreams <br>thats a good title😝😝
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaPLEASE <br>Elle Fanning My ALASKA ❤
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaEep!!
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaDo I have to pay extra for shipping to watch this?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone else understand what this movie I&#39;d about?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaThought it was gonna be shit, then I saw visionary director of Drive. This film will be one of the best of the year.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitak
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitathe Black Swan: Tumblr Edition
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaI feel sorry for all the boyfriends out there that have to be dragged to go see this with their girlfriends, just so they can get some afterwards
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaNicolas Winding Refn loves his colors.
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Keanu Reeves?
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaSeems like horror movies are just getting worse as the years go on..However it is just a trailer I guess...
cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitaAfter Drive, the new cult movie by Refn. Can&#39;t wait.

cipOTUO0CmUdelimeterByIshitafirst
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Wolverine?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI like it. I just accept the fact that movie adaptations are inaccurate nowadays. It&#39;s a miracle that it turned to be a movie and many people would read the books of Ransom Riggs.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaThe full movie for this pls?.. Because I really love it😘😁👍
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaOh my....
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaSo did they replace Emma with another character or something?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitathe trailer tells you nothing of the story like his grandfather or why he was on the island in the first place but other then that it looks great i cant wait
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S OKAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<br>I AM HAPPY IT&#39;S OKAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ATROCIOUS
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaSo.... is Olive and Jacob together beacuse he&#39;s supposed to be with Emma
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaUgh it&#39;s so different from the book. Not like there&#39;s a movie based on book that really follows the book but this is just really different. Agdhfjjf still gonna watch anyway. I waited for so long
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaPeculiars unite! So happy for Riggs
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEva Green = perfection
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing!!!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaAmazing! Can&#39;t wait ♡
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaThis is making me really emotional &gt;.&lt; in the best way possible
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitathey should stop making x-men spinoffs
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitathanks for casting eva green
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEvery scene looked like the exact same scene.<br>I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not another autopilot Tim Burton movie.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaTHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitadont know about you guys but im freakin out because of Asa now
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEva green was made for movies like this
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaSo excited for this movie!!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEmmas peculiarity is Fire... Hallow gast dont actually looks like the slender man.. and Cairnholm is supposed to be a sad place... yet Tim Burton has his ways to direct one good movie.. DONT FAIL US
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhy is Olive Jacob&#39;s love? In the book isn&#39;t Emma Jake&#39;s girlfriend? :O
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m READY for this, it looks amazing! :O
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitachanging into a bird looks cool, i wondered how it will be done ;)

tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshita<b>crying in amazement</b>
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaso basically xmen with Eva green as Xavier
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaMan I really don&#39;t think Eva Green is gonna show her boobs in this one :/

tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaOMYGODDD THIS IS LIT!!!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEvery movie with  &quot;Miss&quot; infront of it has to be weird
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaMy husband and I are over the moon excited! We love the books!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitai had high hopes for this. 😭 I hate it when BIG changes happen especially to important characters.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaThis is what part of X-men?<br><br>Just kidding. :D<br><br>I Love MPHfPC. &lt;3
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaSomething tells me that Emma Bloom&#39;s power was replaced by Olive&#39;s one.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaEva Green is the most underrated actress on the planet.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhy the disappointment? I am actually thrilled to watch the movie! It looks amazing! Beautiful set and mask, nice effects, camera work, cutting... I am excited!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what to think about the trailer &gt;.&lt;
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitais that the xavier school for gifted youngsters that my mother told me about ?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaalso excuse me where is my son Enoch
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaFinally
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitai wont judge until i watch the movie but Im a bit disappointed. hopefully the actors can deliver
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshita...X-Men meets Harry Potter meets a Tim Burton who doesn&#39;t try anymore. Point and shoot, eh Tim?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaX-Children : Miss Peregrine&#39;s School for Gifted Youngsters
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitainteresting
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaBeautiful song!!! I love it!! <br><br>PLEASE DON&#39;T FAIL US, TIM BURTON!! WE TRUST WHAT YOU CHANGED FOR THE MOVIE!!!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaIs the song a new song?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaAs someone who hasn&#39;t read the books, I gotta say that this is the most impressive thing Tim Burton&#39;s done in years in terms of visuals. Fingers crossed he&#39;s starting to get his mojo back after Big Eyes.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshita😭😭😭😭😭😭
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaASA
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhy am I so disappointed?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaLooks good :D
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Olive??? She&#39;s the girl  who can fly! NOT EMMA!😡😠😤
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWait so Emma is Olive + an air bender and Bronwyn&#39;s a little girl now. 😂😂 Still really excited for the movie though.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaslender man at the end!?!?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaBy the looks of it, the cinema will be filled with 9 year olds thinking this an X-Men movie. Is2g this will attract kids.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaPeculiar , very peculiar<br><br>Miss Bloom where&#39;s your fire :O
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitawowwwwwww
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI though to this movie will be scary.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaOH MY GODNESS I AM NOT OK!! &lt;3
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaok Emma&#39;s hair... Jacob&#39;s American accent... EMMA FLOATING... unsure of how I feel about this because the books are one of my favorite all time series. seriously hoping they don&#39;t mess this one up. counting on you Tim Burton xx
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaBoth excited and scared to see the changes done
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaIs emma some kind of an Avatar now? I wont be surprise a long the way she suddenly have Water, Earth and Fire peculiar ability aside from Air. LMAO
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaX- Men for babies. X Kids. <br><br>No?<br><br>Will see myself out.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaWhat, I thought Emma&#39;s peculiarity was fire.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaThis looks decent but bad song choice.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaTHAT SCENE IN THE WATER THING NEVER HAPPENED. IT DIDN&#39;T HAPPEN THAT WAY WHAT TR FUCKSNRNA. BUT I TRUST YOU TIM BURTON DO NOT FAIL ME OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI wonder if asa is still pissed from not getting the role of spidey... I heard his commitment/contract with this series kinda get in the way. Would love him to be spidey tho.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaIM CRYING TEARS OF BLOOD
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaBleh, Tim Burton is a extremely Hit or Miss director, this looks like it might be a miss
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaHollowgast

tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS😭😭 HOPE IT WOULD BE WORLDWIDE. OUR WORLD NEEDS TO SEE THIS WHOLE NEW WORLD.
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaSeems Nice!
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaX-Men for kids?
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitapraying it will do justice
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve read this book a long time ago but knowing Tim Burton is that he&#39;s going to make an emo teenagers version of the X-Men
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure Eva Green will find someway to be naked in this movie 😁👌
tV_IhWE4LP0delimeterByIshitaIM SCREAMING. 😍😍😍

sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up if you&#39;ve been with the series since its start! :)
sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitaI am freaking out right now. I have loved the Divergent Series since the first book came out, and have been waiting for them to make it into a movie for forever. I was worried that it would turn out horribly, but luckily it looks pretty good. Not exactly how I imagined it, but it&#39;s not like they can make it look like every fangirl on the planet wants it to look since we all imagined different things when reading the book. I just wish Uriah was in it. Those pansycakes.
sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitaLoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it ! 
sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitaI read all the trilogy already and got rxcited by this trailer but I think of how strange Shailene (Tris) and Ansel (Caleb) being brother and sister here while in another movie (The Fault in Our Stars) they&#39;ll be lover....
sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitalo ame demasiado es increible!!!
sutgWjz10sMdelimeterByIshitaSuch a pansycake how Uriah, Zeke, Marlene and Lynn won&#39;t be in this movie

5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaHow could it be sssoooooooo GOOD?!
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaI us to be uncontrollably excited about this movie until I heard you changed Snapes relationship with Lily completely. Now, I&#39;m not sure I even wanna see it.
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaWhen you insult Twilight, you insult something that a person has liked for a few years tops, but when you insult Harry Potter you insult someone&#39;s childhood. 
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaETGSDJ That gave me CHILLS! SO BLOOOOOODY FANTASTIC!!!!!
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaWHATS WRONG WITH VOLDEMORT AND HIS NYAHHHHHH SCREAM?

5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshita@echi2567 Better be a &quot;CRUCIO&quot; in there before to show them pain
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitawhat did the twilight fangirl do? just curious cause im a fan of twilight too, and of harry potter of course, just bought the poster book from indigo and omg that trailer was amazing!!!!!!! i cant wait to see the movie

5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshita I can&#39;t even comprehend this, as someone who has followed the series since Day 1, it has become a huge part of my life. This honestly will be akin to losing a piece of myself, and I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready. This has made such a huge impact on the world that it truly won&#39;t ever be the same when it&#39;s gone. 
5NYt1qirBWgdelimeterByIshitaoh my god that will be so epic

g8evyE9TuYkdelimeterByIshitaWith we know about the film I still want to hope there one last trick we dont know about...I still find it very odd that Joseph Gordon Levitt is in this, and appears pretty prominently in this trailer for just &quot;some cop&quot;

iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaOne night stand fantasy.
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaTotal rip off of the 1968 film Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell! <br>Gina Lollobrigida was excellent in that film! <br>Phil Silvers, Shelley Winters, Telly Savales, &amp; Lee Grant were funny in the film too!
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaAmanda Seyfried parece sailor moon mejor amiga sailor Mercury sailor Mars sailor Júpiter sailor v
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaHi
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaalright slight rant un related to the actual trailer and more to the movie but does it bother anyone else that the boat in the beginning of the movie shouldn&#39;t be able to move. there clearly isn&#39;t an outboard motor, open wooden fishing boats don&#39;e typical have inboard motors and if it had a motor there would be a lot of noise. it also doesn&#39;t have a sail, so really she should just be floating not moving, boats can&#39;t actually change direction if they aren&#39;t moving  faster than the water around them. <br>rant over.
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaTimeless
iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaI’m about to watch this movie for the first time

iCVpJ8x1TncdelimeterByIshitaKaren Smith <br>James Bond<br>Professor Erik Selvig<br>Harry Heart <br>Miranda Presently <br>Molly Weasley<br>Howard Stark <br>Katherine from the birdcage

spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaMy nigga s back
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI hate that actresses like Viola (2 nominations, hopefully 3 with Fences) Annette Bening (4 nominations) and Amy Adams (5 nominations)  give amazing performances but never get to win and shallow actresses like Jennifer Lawrence not only get nominated an ugly amount of times (4, possibly 5th this time ugghhhh)  but also end up winning
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaBest female actress: Megan fox
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitayou gotta do doo do coz the dodo said to - that was a line in the trailer right?
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitawow

spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar for best supporting actress goes to...
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaJACKIE ROBINSON

spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitanew song is such a powerful piece of art! Show some love!!! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/barryallenmusic/why-you-always-wanna-leave">https://soundcloud.com/barryallenmusic/why-you-always-wanna-leave</a>
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitauh, is there a backstory xD
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so good!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI think we should make Mexico pay for those fences.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI love Victoria Davis! I love her in How to get away with murder and I&#39;m gonna like her in this
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaDAMNNNN, this looks good
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert- Troy dies at the end and Cory joins the army instead of becoming a football star
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaAcademy award nominee type movie
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitalooks lame.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaHow come it&#39;s hitting on the 25th? Aint nobody going to the movies christmas week!! Is the studio plotting for the movie to fail???
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaMehhh. Kinda tired of the same old same old. Good performances I&#39;m sure will take place and the academy loves a good &quot;black people suffering&quot; movie to spice up the show but can no one else see Hollywood is just throwing what they scratch out at the bottom of the box.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaThat Viola Davis cry alone should win the Oscar...snot and all
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis - that is a good actress 👏 , the lady has commitment and passion
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitafences ain&#39;t good enough we need to build walls strong huge walls.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaDenzel is an amazing actor and never in a bad movie.   but where is the &quot;diversity&quot; in this film? or is it okay because theyre all black ?
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaUntil now I was happy thinking Michelle Williams was going to finally get an Oscar but goddamnit VIOLA NEEDS TO WIN!!!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaYou know it&#39;s going to be good when you get goosebumps from the trailer
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis deserves an oscar &lt;3
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI love Viola and Denzel...I CAN&#39;T WAIT!!!!😆😆😆
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitayes god yes! Oscar for viola because she is simply amazing.  everything about her is just beautiful to watch and hear. Her acting her voice her expressions..Beautiful just beautiful ♡
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitahow yall about to make me cry just off a trailer lol ...cant wait to see this Movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PITTSBURGH">#PITTSBURGH</a> STAND UP!!!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar for best boogers while crying goes too...................
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaSo much hype for this film
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis gives me chills...I want to watch this just for her.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitatbh im ready fam, im ready to cry, this year is the year for tears.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis &lt;3
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaWE read the book in our school for a few weeks but we finished it we even saw a few clips of the movie and now we are gong to see a play about the book
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaCrying and snot does not equal Oscar Nomination. However if her performance is the same as in this trailer the whole movie, then hell yes she should get nominated. I just dont want people to think just because someone cry yells and has a bubbly snot nose in one scene they deserve an oscar.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaYes I&#39;ve been waiting for the sequel to the movie Fences Trailer 1
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaYes God
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaviola looks great but the dialog is just... ham ham ham yikes
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie but I just started my YouTube channel feel free to check it out
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI Wanna watch this movie so bad
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitawoah, just got chills through out my body!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis: <b>breathes</b> <br><br>Me: GIVE HER <b>ALL</b> THE OSCARS
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaIf Viola Davis didnt get that Oscar this time I swear people in that Oscar can choke
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaGuys In case you wonder about the soundtrack in this trailer, is &quot;Elements&quot; by Ludovico Einaudi. Amazing composer!!! enjoy :) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GiveViolaDavisHerOscar">#GiveViolaDavisHerOscar</a>
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshita<b>immediately thinks of Chancellor Dirks</b>
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaBaseball and Football are two different things, dad....
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaMy whole freshman class went to watch this play last year and oh man was it great. Definitely gonna go watch this.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing I can see holding this movie back is that it does look stagy. You can tell it&#39;s a play. But damn, does it look great!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitathis is a lead actor pairing I h ok neatly never thought of. but it makes so much sense you can see already how great this is gonna be.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaHorrible
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaThis sounds like the relationship I have with my... I must see!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;ll see big Oscar nominations for &quot;Fences&quot;!<br><br>I do expected Oscar WINS in Best Actor (Denzel Washington), Best Supporting Actress (Viola Davis) and Best Adapted Screenplay (August Wilson)! :)
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaDo you want to win an Oscar?  Because that&#39;s how you win an Oscar.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaVIOLA RAINHA
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaDamn, this looks fantastic!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaviola davis is gonna kill in this
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaVIOLA DAVIS, I feel you will only stop when you&#39;re dead. You&#39;re amazing and a inspiration for all of us!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitawow.i fell  some awards coming.denzel&amp;viola are great.bravo.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola Davis better get nominated. Never got chills from a performance in a trailer before.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaif this movie doesn&#39;t get nominated for an Oscar I know it&#39;s a fixed system 😐
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome ...100 times Better than Rogue ,Sing and Assassin&#39;s
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitai have been waiting for this movie for ages... another great performance from Viola Davis..... Damn! I love her.... i love Denzel too...
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitatransformers 5!!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaViola. Denzel. August Wilson. Nuff said. Looks good.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaLa La Land is still gonna win. This looks good but La La Land is on a whole different level.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spCxVd9ctFs&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> Ludovico Einaudi is just the best
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitai thought the first trailer is better...until the soundtrack comes out!!! holy shit!! im more hyped than any other superhero blockbuster movies!!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaWow we have a winner
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI am positive VIola will finally win her Oscar with this performance
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshita...fuck
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaSome people build fences to keep people out, and other people build fences to keep people in.
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaI smell some oscars for this movie!! looks great!!
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshitaEsse ator é foda &quot; Dez Washington&quot;....kkkkk😂😂
spCxVd9ctFsdelimeterByIshita👌👌👍👍
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMERYL + JOHNNY = I SMELL OSCARS...
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaSo. I&#39;m spending Christmas Day in a movie theater for Into The Woods and Unbroken. That&#39;s not so bad.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI literally got chills. At the end when the witch sings &quot;Be a child while you are still a child. Withhhhh meeeee&quot; <br>Chills.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOh. My. GOD.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAs a person watching the Original Broadway Production on VHS, I believe I speak for everyone when I say &quot;Disney, don&#39;t you dare screw this up!&quot;
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI wish people wouldn&#39;t see this as some Avengers rip-off team-up film of Disney characters with musical numbers. That&#39;s not at all what it&#39;s like. It&#39;s not an assembly. It&#39;s not structured that way. It&#39;s a story of life lessons.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOnly person who matters in the film is Johnny Depp.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad that they&#39;re aren&#39;t trying to hide the fact that it&#39;s a musical like they did with Sweeney Todd, but I think maybe they should have made the witch more ugly pre-transfromation.  I mean when they did the American Playhouse version I couldn&#39;t even tell that she was Bernadette Peters till after she transformed.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS GOOD!!! I can tell this movie won&#39;t let me down
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI physically and emotionally need this movie right now. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAnd just like that, all my reservations about this movie have melted away
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitathe best thing of my day so far
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI watched this play in middle school. I&#39;m so excited for the movie!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaWow, Meryl Streep is amazing!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshita<i>I</i> wish James Corden would stop existing.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp as the big bad wolf=my ultimate fantasy being fulfilled 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaIt seem to be an awesome movie AFTER the musical - but its also a musical?! Not with me! Good day!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMeryl Streep could play my mother and I&#39;d actually believe it was her.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMeryl&#39;s voice is velvet. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible....
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to... Meryl Streep!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshita&quot;I was raised to be charming, not sincere.&quot; Why did that make me swoon? Probably the tone of his voice.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAnother Oscar nomination for Meryl
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMan, Meryl Streep&#39;s song sound fantastic!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaWicked is gonna be a movie next right?
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m crying
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAre we Out Of The Woods, Out Of the Woods, Out Of The Woods? xD<br>Can&#39;t wait to watch Meryl Streep! She&#39;s amazing.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaHey there Dover Castle 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!! 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, but i would have liked to see more a more racial diverse cast in this movie :c 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Byk9Is3TjY&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> does that mean they&#39;re singing Your Fault???
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI just love musicals so much! &lt;33 I&#39;m so excited for Into The Woods &amp; Annie!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaFor those of you unsure about watching this movie, know that it has an amazing plot.<br>The original musical is known for that.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaHmmm I wonder if Disney will make this Into the Woods as brutal and violent as the real play
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThe chills the feels.. Oh look it&#39;s Johnny Depp. :/
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThis is &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t suck. Please don&#39;t suck. Please don&#39;t suck.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAlways a favorite Sondheim musical!<br><b>Into The Woods</b> on the silver screen, this Christmas Day is looking to be FANTASTIC!!!<br>Did you catch that tender solo by Meryl Streep?<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IntoTheWoods">#IntoTheWoods</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StephenSondheim">#StephenSondheim</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NowPlaying">#NowPlaying</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Disney">#Disney</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23musicals">#musicals</a>
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually like really stoked for this. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaWhy medieval? It is so childish...
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaim sold.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaStill don&#39;t like the costume Johnny Depp has as it looks rediculous and he seems to be getting the most spotlight in terms of advertisement even though The Wolf is a minor character in the play. But, considering he&#39;s a big name, that&#39;s to be expected. But, the movie does look great and I am a huge fan of the play. I&#39;m still going to see it regardless of that one thing that bothers me. :)
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaTo all of you complaining; Sondheim himself worked with this movie and he&#39;s pleased with it. If he&#39;s pleased with it, all of you should be pleased with it. It&#39;s going to be amazing!! ♥
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshita<b>ugly crying</b><br>This is so perfect
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited to finally see this in cinemas! :D
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaYaaassss
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaWth is that? Of course there are good things in there too,but that&#39;s kinda weird that they put different Disney movies together.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaEVERYBODY looks amazing including JOHNNY DEPP...and for those haters he is only one character in a multi-character musical...everything i wished for seems to be in this movie...i will be in line Christmas morn for sure
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite musical of all time - I fell in love with it when I was 13 &amp; I&#39;m 25 now. The trailer looks like the movie will do it wonderful justice. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be able to come to terms with their look of the Wolf, BUT I&#39;m still utterly excited to see it on the big screen. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp is in it !  this movie is going to be amazing CANT WAIT! :D
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m so excited for this movie...
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaLoved Rob Marshall&#39;s adaptation of Chicago, so I can&#39;t wait to see this. One of my favorite musicals growing up!! :)
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThe effects look great, the makeup looks great... agh, but the music. I&#39;m not on-principle opposed to musicals. But yikes, that opening chorus sounds like something from a High School play. And Meryl Streep (?!!) doesn&#39;t characterize her singing when made up as an ugly old hag? The music ALL sounded like it ruins the whole.<br><br>That&#39;s just judging on this snippet, of course.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI am excited. So far they have done Soundheim justice based on this trailer, and I assume they will do it justice in the full movie. I am at peace thanks to that trailer.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI have two opposite forces driving me closer and away from this movie. I love the idea, the characters, the plot. But then, there&#39;s Johnny Depp playing himself once again...<br><br>I&#39;d so like a movie version with Johnny Depp edited out of it.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaGreat ensemble of cast! And it&#39;s in musical!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitameryl &lt;3
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaWhy the fuck do people find Anna Kendrick hot? Her face looks horribly disfigured and her body&#39;s average at best.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe Disney got to do this movie, there are so many undertones and intimacy that will be cut out.  
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaohhh I think this trailer spoil too much? hahah anyway im so freaking exciteddddd to bad we could watch this on january instead of christmasssss :/
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaShe should keep the blue hair
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOmgg♥
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaScott M Yay! I love musicals! Can&#39;t wait for this.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitathis looks fun
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI lost interest when i heard that  disney was censoring the musical.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaeven I don&#39;t understand the plot.. I think this will be worth to watch..
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOh man, I cannot wait to see this.This is THE movie I`ve been waiting for.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaTHE MOMENT,IN THE WOODS!!!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI LOVED THIS TRAILER, THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI dont get the story can anyone tell me what is it about
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOH GOD I LOVE THIS MOVIE I&#39;VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.  I LOVE ANNA KENDRICK and MERYL STREEP AND JOHNNY DEPP and CHRIS PINE
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI wish they didn&#39;t show Meryl post transformation. That would have been a good surprise to see in the film first.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaChristmas cannot come quick enough for me. I am so excited. I hope it stay&#39;s true to the original with Bernadette Peters.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOmg Meryl&lt;3 I didn&#39;t expect that at all, it was beautiful!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAnna kendrick 😍😘
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to watch this!! &gt; &lt;

2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaHOLY CRAP I&#39;M WEEPING
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so promising! I can&#39;t wait to see it!!!!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI never even saw or heard of the musical, so I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m kind of intrigued.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaCant wait for this.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshita&quot;You wish to have the curse....reversed?&quot;<br><br>Go to Meryl Streep.<br><br>Yes, Meryl Streep can do anything. <b>*worship*</b>
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaHoly cr*p! Meryl looks (and sounds) AWESOME!!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaLove this trailer except for one thing: Johnny Depp&#39;s wolf costume.  What in the world were they thinking?  Looks like something you&#39;d see in an elementary school play not a high tier hollywood production.
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see Meryl singing on our screens again, it has been too long. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI just peed my pants from excitement. Literally, everything about this movie looks like perfection. IS IT DECEMBER YET?!?!?!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaMERYL!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;3333333333 :O !
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAll of my favs in this
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaI really REALLY hope they don&#39;t ruin this musical too much. It has such potential to make a huge impact and teach some good lessons. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaSO glad Meryl&#39;s doing another musical! her voice is amazing
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAHHH! I adore the musical, and I&#39;m so excited to see the movie!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaPretty excited, Jack is still to young, and the wolf costume still sucks, but there are SOME positives. There must be. Meryl Steep sound pretty good. I do hear some dialogue thats not in the original show, thats concerning. I know they already cut it by a half an hour, why are they changing the script too. I think overall I&#39;ll be pretty disappointed, I&#39;ll still see it, but I&#39;ll be watching in fear that they ruined my favorite Musical. 
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME!<br><br>My magical childhood is back! :&#39;)
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaso excited for this
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOooo. I was worrying before, since I&#39;m such an immense fan of this musical, but it really is looking quite good. Especially in this trailer which is a lot clearer than the others. I&#39;m still a little nervous because I want it to be wonderful and really do justice to the work of art that is this show... but I have faith and I&#39;m excited to see how it turns out!!
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good, the acting and music is really good! I can&#39;t wait to see this :)
2Byk9Is3TjYdelimeterByIshitaOMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE SINGING IN THIS TRAILER!!!!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!!......I&#39;m happy
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaJust finish watching this masterpiece again, it was better than the last time i watched. Excellent acting, the music is on &quot;key&quot; and if you love Drums &amp; Jazz like me it&#39;s a must watch.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita&quot;Are you one of those, single teared people&quot; is some funny shit 😂😂😂
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitathis movie was exactly my tempo
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaModern Masterpiece
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaThe ONLY way this piece of trash movie can be inspiring would be to stand up against blatant narcissists like this &quot;teacher&quot; and this would be the worst way to do it.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaReally really good movie even if you can&#39;t find the beat.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitamovie is so amazing but so incredibly triggering if u undergone abuse from your teachers!
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita🔥🎸
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitawanted to show my grandson a show about percussions, as much as I wanted to I cant show him this.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is breathtaking
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING !!
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita🤩
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaHighly recommend for those who do don&#39;t know what to do or who they are. <br>I promise this film will be very useful and also beneficial for them.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant movie 👌🏼
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita“There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job.&quot;<br>                                      <br>                                    - Terence Fletcher
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita“Show me your rudiments”
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie!!!
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaJeff Bezos
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitahands bleeding and everything
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaI still don&#39;t see him as Mr. Fantastic. He&#39;s like a poor man&#39;s Shia Lebouf and that&#39;s not something to brag about.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based off the studio band in my high school, and the teacher is based off the brother of the band teacher that I had last year.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshita
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitasaw the trailer on Sunday just before Boyhood started and never has a trailer left me not only anticipating a movie, but left me breathless. fingers crossed for it to play in my little town as well a what could be a shoo in for Oscar noms for Teller and Simmons.
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaCool<br>
oAhvG3wIE_gdelimeterByIshitaRO-AR !!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaI love that Trailer. I&#39;m very happy, when he gets to the Cinema. LOVE THAT.<br>Best Actionmovie for me in 2014.<br>I hope, they make a trilogy and in the final part Comes UNICRON, this would be AWESOME
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaque tal optimus prime O: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDGqmxMZFI&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a>

dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/dYDGqmxMZFI?t=1m23s">1:23</a> the humans kill ratchet
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaTRANSFORMERS 4: AGE OF EXTINCTION!!! ﻿
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaMy prediction:<br>People love the trailer a lot and praise the movie that it will be the best Transformers movie ever. But when they see the movie, most people will hate it.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitano ratchet the medic arm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaThat was a beautiful trailer :&#39;)
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitarachet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/dYDGqmxMZFI?t=1m25s">1:25</a> Ratchet!!!!!!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else see rachet get shit on 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaI knew one of the transformers movies one day will have an dino xD dino transformers are just so badass
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaRatchet <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDGqmxMZFI&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDGqmxMZFI&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a>? 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look as epic has the third one. Still though Grimlock will show us otherwise. 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitathe whole world knows about the transformers so the transformers hide again. turns out there are bad guys coming. we ask help from them again. the end. + explosions
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaPrepare yourselves for Explosions and long scenes of people running away from Explosions, and Boobs.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitathe story sounds like transformers 3.We don&#39;t need you anymore and then we need you again 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaAlso, are they&#39;re MECH.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaHe said they don&#39;t need him anymore, will the Decepticons are back and here for revenges.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitano ratchet the medic arm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaMARKY MARK TO THE RESCUE
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitalike seriously, did they seemed like they just recycled dark of the moon. 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaI wish I could find a transformer...
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitathe trailer sucked wtf
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaDINOBOTS!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY SOME DINOSAURS AND DRAGONS
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible, sure the cgi is a bit cartoonish but the storyline looks amazing!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitasomebody please tell me ratchet isn&#39;t dead wtf , but the trailer was sick tho
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a film major and we&#39;re now in post-production of a film trailer I wrote. Guess what…its gonna suck. Why? Because I&#39;m unfortunately apart of the &quot;Entitlement Generation&quot;. Enough said. Anyway, I felt as though I was blinking uncontrollably throughout the majority of this trailer. I wasn&#39;t.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaEhh looks like the same repetitive cgi effects/storyline, doesnt look like a movie id watch with marky mark in it lol
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaWe need these kind of films. Big, pretty and stupid blockbusters like pacific rim or avengers so that we can switch our brains off for 2 hours. Robot dinosaurs, a hot girl, and lots of explosions. We all need this, don&#39;t even try to deny it.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaisnt this the exact same plot as the second and third one?? humans say they dont want the autobots anymore and want them gone and then a &quot;dangerous enemy&quot; comes and they have to unite again with the autobots to defeat them?
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitagood shit !
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitalooks much better than the 3rd one. ill give this a chance again 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT!! YEAH!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaf***ing Awesome
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaIts still in Post production is why the CGI looks unpolished. The movie won&#39;t look finished till its closer to release.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaJust look like DOTM too much humans.... somebody PLEASE TELL ME why are humanS looking for Optimus it should be gavaltron who cares about the humans it&#39;s transformers not HUMANFORMERS.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaMother of lord!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaim so mad i could have been an extra in texas
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME trailer.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitathis is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaThey hated people saying the word ratchet, so they killed Ratchet 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful.

dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDGqmxMZFI&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a>
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaholly shit
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaIn this trailer you can see Ratchet getting wrecked, Possibly this is how he dies in this movie. I thought Lockdown would kill him due to their past rivalry.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaHonestly I am not impressed with this trailer. Not enough focus on the Transformers and far too much focus on the humans. Has Michael Bay not realized that most of us don&#39;t give two craps about the human characters? Meh. Whatever.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m fine with Optimus&#39;s new body, but his face kinda creeps me out.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaOptimus was riding Grimlock, but he&#39;s bitch slapping him here. What did I miss?
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaRATCHET!!!!!!!<br>1;28
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaoh yes
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaoh boy what a great birthday present! thank you Michael Bay for giving us this trailer on my birthday! 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaOMG I cant wait til the film comes up !!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaTransformers vs Jurassic Park robots lol
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaNO NO NO NO NO PLEASE DON&#39;T KILL RATCHET!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaSo humans killed ratchet.........damn
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaWoah Dinobots!!!!!! Optimus was shot in the chest!? Not again. Don&#39;t let him die. Is Mark is Sam? 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this movie I&#39;m 9 and I am going to be a derector an make transformers movies!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaCrap Ratchet dies who knew? Anyways THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaratchet noooooo!! :&#39;(
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaLooks better then the second
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaThats how you tame a Dinobot, punch that jive turkey in the face!
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look all that, if it didn&#39;t have mark wahlberg let alone Shia labeouf  I would not watch this movie....
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitahmmm.....looks like a transformer movie..lol
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaOoooooooooh shit ...
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else see Rachet get wrecked?  :(
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitafifth
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshita
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaBumblebee being chased by ships, lockdown, optimus smacking grimlock in the face, a &#39;remembering chicago, report alien activity&#39; billboard, human bad guys, better CGI than the big game spot. Michael Bay did this film right. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS FILM.
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaAs much Michael bay shit on my childhood and RAPED it like an animal this trailer makes me wanna see this movie and no those shitty actors from before why not give it another try you know ? 
dYDGqmxMZFIdelimeterByIshitaAmazing.. Just.. Amazing..

LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaReally want to see Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy together as both are My Fav..<br>I think this will be going to be incredibly awesome..B-)
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaHello, first certain Best Picture nominee.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaA movie with an interesting trailer and a good title? Rarer by the day.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaJust showed the whole movie, no need to see it now.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaStopped halfway through the trailer, way to many spoilers.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaStunning cinematography. I&#39;m so excited to see it.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaIt has been a very very long time since a trailer has literally knocked me for six like this one, i love the fact that the shot this movie using natural light, the bear attack looks absolutely terrifying,   Leonardo DiCaprio, and Tom Hardy are just giving it their all and it really shows, Breathtaking......
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitachivo will win again the oscar for the best cinematography. that last shot in thos trailer with the horse falling in to the river!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLeonardo NoOscaro.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLooks brilliant
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWords can&#39;t describe my excitement for this. I want to be an actor so bad and these 2 only add more inspiration to that every time I watch them.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWow, That bear must have been trained pretty hard :-P
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is really overrated!! I won&#39;t watch it.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy is definitely gonna win this year...
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaEmmanuel Lubezki is in a league of his own! Odds on him winning three years in a row?
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThe main reason I&#39;m excited for this is because of Lubezki
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaGet ready for ONE guy to win the Oscar for best Cinematography THREE YEARS IN  A ROW.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaand this trailer spoils everything
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaA webo pinche Iñarritu chingón. Sólo a 13 pobres diablos no les gusta, jajaja!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty cool!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitalet&#39;s hope Innaritu bring back the birdman magic again! vamos mexicana
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitahope leo wins wins an oscar for this
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaum, wow
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaum, wow
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is about to be PHAT!!!!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaSo, Oscar for Emmanuel Lubezki for the third time in a row, and at least another nom for Iñarritu and Leo.<br><br>This could be the best movie of the year.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI wonder how they did that bear scene
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaMy most anticipated film of the year! The cinematography is awesome and definitely Oscar worthy!!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshita This movie looks awesome! Tom hardy is definitely getting his first Oscar nomination this year
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaChivo at it again.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitatom hardy is badass!!!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23oscarforhardy">#oscarforhardy</a>
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLooks like Leo might finally get his oscar. Cause dang this movie looks intense.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThe first trailer for Revenant was much better. It was heart pounding. This one gives to much away.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis will make me criminal, raping the replay button.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitawhoa....
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitainception 2.0. Well I&#39;ll freeze my butt off just from watching this...
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWow...this looks incredible.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshita👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThe nominees for Best Actor are: <br>Leonardo DiCaprio<br>Leonardo DiCaprio<br>Leonardo DiCaprio<br>Leonardo DiCaprio<br>Leonardo DiCaprio<br><br>And the Oscar goes to:<br>THE BEAR.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaOscar buzz for Leo DiCaprio but I think this one will be the one. Iñarritu and Lubezki did it again. Cheers for both Mexican paisanos.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLeo is always in cool movies ,, never dis-pointed
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitawhat a piece of art!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitabayıldımm bittimmmm
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThe Cinematography is Amazing Here!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWOW BEST MOVİE
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a epic masterpiece!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI know this is flaccid bbut, Leo your most beloved when you are in a beard 
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaBest Picture<br>Best Director<br>Best Cinematography<br>Best Actor<br>Best Supporting Actor<br><br>...I could even venture a guess based on the two trailers and say Best Editing and Best Sound Editing too but don&#39;t want to seem too biased.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaoh my god.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshita10\10, на кончиках пальцев, отбивается по эмоциям даже по трейлеру
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaCobb and Eames trapped in deep limbo!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitathese gonna be the best film of the year and I hope both Leo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy will win oscars
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaIts already my favorite movie this year and its just the trailer! Wow!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI like the trailer but it shows a little too much!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitamy  2015  top 10
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitafighto leo
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWow! This gave me goose bumps.The cinematography is just unbelievable. Lubezki should win (again). Leo and Hardy should win too.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThree in a row for Lubezki.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaForget about the movie, Just give Leo an Oscar!!!!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis makes you wonder, in just how many levels of dreams Cobb and Eames have wandered off.. Or perhaps they are just messing around with weeds and that machine.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitathis movie will get all the oscars best actor , best supporting actor best cinematography , best director why because the academy is about these movies they like simple , natural movies with a simple plot and a deep meaning
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI can`t get over how stunning this film looks and that bear attack is genuinely terrifying.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaLook at that cinematography.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaHuh. Whelp! Looks like i&#39;m finally watching something set before WW1!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitawhy i feel that Tom Hardy is really going to win an Oscar ? 
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWow. Tom Hardy is just so unrecognizable. <br>He sounds like a mix between Buffalo Bill and his Lawless character but he is a master of accents.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitalets hope he gets an Oscars for this :-p
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaHoly Shitsauce!! Iñárritu make some room on your shelf, your gonna need it!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI need to change my pantaloons. It appears I have shat myself
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaI Came.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaOnce again, Lubezki proves he&#39;s the greatest living cinematographer.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis looks beautiful.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaЗаебись! надеюсь, получит оскар  за этот  фильм...
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshita<b>LOOKS LIKE ACTION TRILLER, AGAIN NO OSKAR, LEO^^</b>
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaOMG OSCAR OSCAR!!!!!!!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like another best picture award for Alejandro
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaMark my words, Tom Hardy is going to win the Oscar.
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaЕСЛИ ОН НЕ ПОЛУЧИТ ОСКАР ТО Я УЖЕ НЕ ЗНАЮ ЧТО ЕМУ ДЕЛАТЬ
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaJESUS!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitalooks promising!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitanew attempt for oscar

LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaIf this doesn&#39;t get Leonardo Dicaprio an Oscar, nothing will
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaholy f**k ... Decaprio  and Hardy  ,what a team . decaprio is going to get another statue for this one
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaBy the looks of this trailer, this film could go down as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever created. Not even kidding. My most anticipated film of the year!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaso annoyed that it doesnt get a wide release until January 16th or something, then i cant say if it&#39;s one of the best of 2015 or not!
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaBest picture winner, 2016.

LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWow

LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaMy goodness, this looks amazing! &quot;And the Oscar for Best Cinematography goes to... Emmanuel Lubezki!&quot;
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaSo hyped for this<br>-A,x
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaomg omg omg omg
LoebZZ8K5N0delimeterByIshitaWhen all is lost, you fight. Watch the new trailer for The Revenant Movie, in theaters this December.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song at the end please ? :)
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t bane crush your face dagget?
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshita2013 is going to be the best movie year ever
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaI loved Blue Valentine. I think this looks great. 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaI read in an interview by Rotten tomatoes that Ryan Gosling has been offered superhero movies before but turned them down or wasnt available to commit. He considers Drive to be his superhero movie.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWhere is his scorpion jacket?
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaITS DAGGET!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s going to be a great movie. Derek Cianfrance is in the process of becoming one of my favorite directors.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be amazing.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaHe and Michael Fassbender are just about the best working right now.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis cast is amazing.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaHa, I just saw the trailer and thought &quot;ooooh Dane Dehaan! Must see!&quot;
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitano critic quotes about Dane DeHaan?!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitawow..
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaFinally! I&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer forever and they kept witholding it. Fucking stoked now, totally worth the wait. 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaIn this movie he will finally show what it really takes to be REAL HUMAN BEING AND A REAL HERO
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis is just cool.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitabeginning of trailer: creamed my pants
middle of trailer: adrenaline rush
end of trailer: muttered &quot;...holy shit that looks amazing.&quot;
then tried to come up with a way to break up ryan and eva mendes and have him marry michelle williams.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaSmells like Oscar, all over the place.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDude...where do you get your info that is 100 percent wrong.....they are not in the movie...
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaI live where this was filmed. I&#39;m seeing this midnight release

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaBecause im batman

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaMike Patton 29-The Snow Angel
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitawhats the song used at the end?
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDirector of Blue Valentine...Actor from Blue Valentine..... I&#39;m already SOLD. 
When is this playing and where....and I&#39;ll be there opening night. 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaRyan Reynolds, Robert Downey, and Bruce Willis is also in this movie too but in smaller roles. I even heard James Franco and Tom Hardy is in it also. If this true it&#39;s going to be one of the greatest cast movies ever.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaomg its Drive 2!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWow
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaOh man, are they trying to overwhelm the movie with handsomeness?
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaVery dramatic 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWow!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaSo basically this is Drive 2, only this time he is on a motorcycle!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good.

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitano but slightly similiar
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitawow
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be amazing. Maybe my most anticipated movie for next year
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaRyan should play a superhero.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDrive but on dirt bikes and more emotional
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaif its ryan gosling.. its gonna be brilliant !!!!

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDRIVER BUT ON A MOTORBIKE ? YEAH I AM INTO IT
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDerek Cianfrance is a filmmaking prodige, anything he makes is going to be gold. I am so excited for this.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaHey there, Daggett.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaYes
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDAT CAST......Dayum.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaNossa parece muito bom! Quero assistir, sem contar que com esse elenco maravilhoso! Ryan e Bradley *---*
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaDamn RG he&#39;s so good looking &lt;3
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaTypical youtuber logic: OMG Ryan Goosleg means there is no way i am not liking this video!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be sad, &quot;From the Director of Blue Valentine,&quot; there will be tears, bring tissues.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaBradley Cooper and Ryan Gosling! Two very good reasons to watch this movie! :D
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWow.... Can&#39;t wait.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaLooks damn good
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitamovie has heart..am in
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaI live near where parts of this was filmed WOOO
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaFinally!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaBad ass actors
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitawhat does it mean if you discribes as electric xD 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitagonna be one of the best of 2013 for sure.so excited for this one.
also @7Reatz totally agree lol

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai really like the guy and he is stepping up his acting but i dont think we should compare them both not yet 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaExactly what I was thinking
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitachild.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaIts called The Place Beyond the Pines. It tells you at right above the video.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaIts Drive with motorbikes... looks gd
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaBecause there&#39;s someone in the movie called Ryan fucking Gosling!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a Good One! 
Lot of good movies coming out in 2013!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshita&quot;I ride.&quot;
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitacouldn&#39;t agree more
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s much better than Brad Pitt..
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitais this drive part 2....?
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaAll the buzz and reactions I&#39;ve been hearing is that Cooper is brilliant. Like he steals the whole movie. In fact, if they would have released it this year, he probably could end up with an Oscar Nom. for Best Supporting Actor. That&#39;s just what I heard from my friends who went to TIFF. 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai imagine it would be a bit dull but emotional and heartbreaking like Blue Valentine. also, i like the cast.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t anyone talking about Bradley fucking Cooper!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitathis looks depressing
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitalooks nice and has a little bit of DRIVE style
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai WOULD watch this if EVA wasn&#39;t in it. she can&#39;t even act
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitathe place beyond the penis
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaHe already is!
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitawhats daggett doing here
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitahow the fuck is this HD... horrible 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai think i speak for many guys when i say i gotta a man crush on Ryan Gosling! And no im not gay btw ... but fuck it&#39;s Ryan Gosling
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitabreathless
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai was think more along the lines of Marlon Brando
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshita&quot;If you ride like lighting, you&#39;re gunna crash like thunder&quot; 

G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaHeat meets Drive.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaIf it ain&#39;t Crime-Drama it ain&#39;t a masterpiece. 
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitai can just sense that this film will be amazing
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaI love it when Ryan Gosling does these great movies like, Drive and Blue Valentine. I think it shows his true acting talent. These are just my favorite type of movies to experience.
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitaMajor man crush on Ryan Gosling
G07pSbHLXggdelimeterByIshitacool. cool cool cool
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS SO GOOD YET SO SCARY
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaDeadpool will probably jump through dimensions to save his wife
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSo, is the sister supposed to be mentally handicapped? That&#39;s the only thing that can explain the sound at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgdxIlSuB70&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a>
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaJ&#39;ai trop envie de le voir de toute façon les films de Sony sont toujours top du top 👍👍👌👌👌
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThe shark would not be hungry after eating two grown men. The shark probably would have left and she could have swam back to shore.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYou had me until the shark jumped out of the water. The trailer fell apart after that.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI call BS. I wish this wasn&#39;t so unrealistic. Great white sharks only breach near seal island and in false bay which are both located in South Africa. There has never been a reported sighting of a shark breaching in Australia. Also, if a shark did attack one of the guys swimming, then they almost certainly would not have attacked the second guy, let alone chase him down to the rock. Great white sharks have very, very sensitive teeth, as soon as they bite into you and realize that you do not have the fat density that they need for their diet (like a seal), they usually lose interest except for in cases of extreme hunger. A shark would never, never wait around a rock waiting for a person to jump in the water. The shark would have swam away within minutes of the first attack.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaAnother movie that&#39;s going to make me never wanna swim again... :)
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis movie actually looks really frightening.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait 😍
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaOn the one hand, this does look like a pretty good movie. The premise sounds interesting, it leads itself to tension very well, the cinematography looks gorgeous, and the effects for the shark actually looks surprisingly good.<br><br>On the other hand, whenever the shark does ANYTHING in this trailer, my inner nerd kicks in and says, &quot;Nope. No. Not a chance, thousand times no.&quot; But if the movie delivers, I&#39;ll be okay with it.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get salty with me
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a big fin of shark movies
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYou must be cold blooded if you aren&#39;t hype for this!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaGreat another shark movie to make people hate them even more👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI sense that this movie will bring a great cash FLOW
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaWater we waiting for?
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitales français 😂
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSTOP SHOWING SO MUCH OF THE MOVIE
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaCant wait to see this!!!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaAnyone else reach for their phone?
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSeeing Blake Lively in a bikini for nearly two hours...enough said. I am sold.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSuch a beautifully shot movie. Especially at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgdxIlSuB70&amp;t=0m11s">0:11</a>
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaso is it shark movie a action movie or a surfer movie
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to watch this who else??
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaOpen Water meets Jaws... Yawn
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI bet it&#39;s gonna be good but these trailers are trash lol. But I&#39;m interested!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaBecause the sharks have human-like thinking and behavior :P
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaTHEY SPOILED THE MOVIE WHEN THE SHOWED HER STABBING THE SHARK
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty fucking goood
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSmile you sunofa...
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshita&quot;Uh uh&quot;
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s gonna need a bigger rock.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaJesus christ that looks retarded.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaLooking good Sony!  Shark seems little bit CGish but any way nice pictures of water and underwater ambient, real nice!<br>Lively looking good in her role!<br>Think about the result if a mechanical shark like Bruce was used  :)<br>Thumbs up!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThey &quot;jump the shark&quot; at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgdxIlSuB70&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a> ... literally.<br>Was kinda hoping they&#39;d go for a &quot;less is more&quot;-approach to these trailers. Still gonna see it, but hype is lessened.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitacan she not signal some one on the shore to call for the coast guard or something
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis is why I don&#39;t do the ocean!!!lol
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaWHY???? WHY AGAIN!!!! It is not the truth!!!!! And it harms the sharks, as people are not willing to protect them... WHY!!!!!!!!!?????????!!!!!! In the name of the Sharks stop such bullshit!!!!!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaJaws is the only great shark movie, but this looks pretty amazing. Definitely going to see it!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSharks eat, swim, and make little sharks. They do not hunt people. Once they eat the first guy they are full and move on.  On the other hand Orca&#39;s hunt sharks. Silly movie but Blake is so Friggin hot, I will watch it anyway.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitawow way to show everything no need to see it now
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaDeadpool is soooo lucky :D:D
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitashes to beautiful fro this embarrassing crap
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaso its basically just jaws
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaLoved the movies with sharks as a kid, but now movie makers are just making them more worse than they already were. I actually thought, this might turn out goo, after seeing the first trailer, but here they go again making another dumb Jaws movie.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaLOL... So bad it might be good
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitathis looks really cool. they showed a little too much but i honestly dont care. it&#39;ll still be fun to watch. cant wait.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaAnother reason for a blonde from Hollywood to show off her body in every scene of a movie in a bikini.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaBased on a true story of Jaws&#39; cousin Franklin, nicknamed &quot;the bully of paradise&quot;.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitastupid movie with a whore playing the lead role.  Count me out
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaOy veh, Sharkbusters !  Include me out.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSo.....it&#39;s Jaws. I was actually really excited for this, but the more I see trailers for it, the more I think.....eh.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaso the shark can jump high enough to eat that dude mid air but he can&#39;t do that with the chick on the tiny rock?? Hollywood logic..
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitawe need a bigger buoy!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitawow
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaFffffainaly a shark movie!!!!!!! Thank you SONY
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Deadpool comes and saves her.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis is why you get a waterproof cellphone...
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI am so hyped for this!!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaGreat trailer! Thanks for sharing Columbia.  Now I can save my $20 since you just showed us the entire movie!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYES!!!! NEW SHARK MOVIE!!!!!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshita1st trailer should&#39;ve been the only trailer
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThe bite mark on her leg looks PUNY when you compare it to the size of the shark we see kill that guy.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSome very beautiful imagery in this, looks like a good watch.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitacool
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitai felt this gave away a bit too much
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaI have been waiting for a good trailer of this movie looks great! tired of all the fake movies of sharks after jaws but this one looks to have a real feel to it!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaRyan Reynolds hit the jackpot
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis movie could be really good.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaLove shark movies and love a kickass heroine. Count me in.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitastraight to dvd
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSo I guess she makes it to the buoy.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaderp
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaJesus, we just watched the whole movie. And now when I watch it, there&#39;s not going to be any suspense regarding whether she makes it to buoy. Do better, Sony
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty cool. But I think they showed too much. Should have stopped when the shark eats that guy surfer.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThere is no way a shark can breach in shallow water. C&#39;mon Hollywood have you not watched Shark Week on Discovery?
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThe first trailer had me intrigued because it had a shroud of mystery- very little was shown. Just Blake Lively on top of a rock with a shark swimming around. This one, however, spoiled a few things that would otherwise have tension whilst watching the movie. So I hope Sony doesn&#39;t release any more trailers for this film.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaNot too happy about the CGI shark, but looks pretty cool.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYawnn..
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThe most unrealistic things about this were the shark attacking her without being provoked and how the internet on the island was good enough for her to skype her sister with a Full HD stream.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaWho needs short films anymore when you have trailers
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitacarol ferris is lara croft /oliver queen now yay
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaIt should be called The Swallows.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaFor once I actually hope the shark wins.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaDeadpool will save her.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitathe shark looks amazing!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaSpotted, Serena van der woodsen..
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaOh gosh, who the hell is calling me on skype again, I mean seriously, people really should first send a text message, then I can reply, then we can chat, really, this is a videochat, maybe I&#39;m naked, then of course if I don&#39;t take your call, you&#39;ll be sooo offended, cause who the hell I think I am for not answering a skype call and... Oh, the call was only in the trailer.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS SO FUCKING GREAT
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaWell I guess I dont have to see it cause I just watched the whole thing
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaMeh
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYay a jaws remake
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaYet another trailer pretty much ruins an entire movie&#39;s plot, best bits etc... The first trailer released made it much more mysterious.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaGod, i hope this is the revolution of shark movie.
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaAquaman sending Jaws to eat ppl again
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaWow I&#39;m impressed. Not your stupid average trailer with cliche music and scares...
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis is a combination of &quot;The Grey&quot; and &quot;The Martian&quot; under the sea of hell!!!
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaFor some reason I jumped when the Skype ringtone came on...
EgdxIlSuB70delimeterByIshitaThis will be more sinister than The Grey or The Martian
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaWas that a part of the Drive soundtrack at the beginning?

Eh, nice touch.
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitacan ne1 tell me what is the song that is at the and of the trailer?

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song they&#39;re using in this trailer?
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaOh yes can&#39;t wait
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitame too bro. this is the real fast and furious.
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitadoes any one know if the first beat of the trailer is a dubstep song or just a beat thrown in there?

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitalooks nice just like all the other F&amp;F series 

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaBoom when&#39;s the release date anyone?
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitalooks great!

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshita&quot;an entire military convoy.&quot; 
1 jeep and a semi truck. Wow budget must be low for the military. (0_0)
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaTokyo Drift wasn&#39;t even a part of the real series. Just some crap with shitty actors and the result fucking sucked. The only reason some of the actors from the originals was in it. Was that they had to ensure that they could keep the series of movies going!

and btw. fuck Tokyo Drift
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen the whole movie... It was 3 minutes and 22 seconds long... but I&#39;m waiting for the extended version... :D

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaYeah, looks like a real simple life
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaNothing like the OG Fast and the Furious. That was my shit. This looks like a fun movie to watch though
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaAN ENTIRE MILITARY CONVOY? THERE WERE THREE FUCKING VEHICLES FOR FUCKS SAKE.

dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaAll the cool stuffs have been showed. Let&#39;s spend your money to watch the rest of talking and arguing.
dKi5XoeTN0kdelimeterByIshitaRight ok so here in england the police go around shooting at criminals who look like Wayne Rooney and drive cars that look like they were on robot wars. (In the UK the police aren&#39;t armed)

A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaIs this horror..?
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaWoohooo 👏
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaWatched it this morning alone n I’m watching it again same day showing my wife. 10/10 recommend
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaAwewome movie. First movie I&#39;ve ever watched with no scores. The wind is the only music you will hear.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaI seen this movie in chanell 13 in austin tx 1983 and it was free ..now l dont pay to watched no wey
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaI never seen this trailer before now.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaCall it!
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaHappy 15th Anniversary!
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaWhat scares me the most is who&#39;s the psychopath that thought of n wrote this masterpiece of cinema?!?!? Stfu I already know, my point is who tf thinks up this kinda crap n lives a normal life?!??!?!
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t they ever make a sequel?
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaSomeone said i had my hair like someone in this movie.... only one close is the bad guy.... hardy har!
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaShown in: <br>Halloween <br>We Own the Night<br>Gone, Baby, Gone<br>Saw IV
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaGreatest movie I’ve ever seen, and best book I ever read
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaRIP Miramax
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is awesome!! It’s the best to come out during the holiday season of 2007 since The Kite Runner and Grace is Gone
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThere’s something about trailers that ruins the movie for me 😅 or at least when I wanna show the movie to someone I feel the trailer doesn’t represent it, it’s just better to watch it
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThe Gas Station Scene alone would have been the perfect trailer. Just the scene as is. Best part is that it cuts off just after the old man calls it but before the coin is revealed.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThis man is literally Stelio Kontos
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of those movies, if I see it on TV (even though I have it on DVD), no matter where in the movie it is, I&#39;ll sit down, stop  and watch it.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie I just don&#39;t understand Moss after you took out the GPA why the hell you just aint leave the damn country wit ur family instead you continue to stay in the same area not only that but you begin to look for Anton who&#39;s a straight killer.. this dude Anton chigurh was a straight monster.. what a movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time I have to give this a 9 out of a 10.. just for the Anton character alone is worth the watch.. definitely a good movie If you haven&#39;t seen this movie I think you should,  you definitely won&#39;t be disappointed..
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a classic in my eyes
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaThe dark descent to a sort of hell.   I kind of wish I never went here.  But still, I can&#39;t look away.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer for an amazing film
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaJavier bardam has the best slickest sickest role in this movie lol what a role
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies ever made.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitathe movie just sucks...the ending is dumb and  so frustrating
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaShould I watch this with my dad
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaBest movie I have ever seen , love every bit of it
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaNirvana
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaworth watching yes or no?
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaWe need a law that says no clips from the end of a damn movie in the stupid trailer. Everything in a trailer should have to come from the first 15 minutes of a film.
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaFinal scene<br>&quot;Will you hold still sir&quot;? =<br>Bill Gates vaccine
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitaCompressed air bullets...
A0oNrgumrlEdelimeterByIshitagoooood
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaBelieve it me! I bet this movie didn&#39;t make any money at the box office. Besides alot of these movies that are based off of  books will be nothing but a box office disaster. All the film industries cares about is superhero movies.😒
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaHaven’t watched it, but can imagine the worst part is watching people chip away at their own soul, mascaraed as what not. While there’s nothing you can do about it.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitawow what a setting, this is like seeing the great pyramids being built.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite movies. I&#39;ve seen it 7 times.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitathis movie never old in my eyes 👀

4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaХуйня даже для дрочки не подойдёт
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaBut this trailer sucks
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaOmg.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaXXXXX
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWhat makes a good movie? When two meme stars come together
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never seen this film but there are spoilers in the comments for people who never saw this movie 😡
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s 2020, I watched this movie for the first time and in love with it
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitais it worth watching ??
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitau guyz issed amitabhg
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshita&quot;pizza time&quot;
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the spiderman doing here?
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still made about how fucking awful the fashion is here.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t this on netflix.. Google says it is on netflix but it isnt, just wasted £12 ffs
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaVery basic directing. Nothing matches the era. Nothing is vintage. The accents&quot; the decor, the imagery, the essence. Fail .
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaCompared to the original movie made by Jack Clayton in 1974, with Robert Redford as Gatsby and Mia Farrow as Daisy, this new movie with L. DiCaprio is a failure....!
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaAmitabh? Wow
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaLana Del Rey’s song in this film😍
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever!!!
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaJust think it is funny that the man was upset his wife was cheating when he was also cheating.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI’ve never seen the movie but I just finished the book and all I can say in response to this trailer is what the actual fuck was that?
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think the directors intended for this film to be just another dry pbs period piece, based exactly on the book with music true to the time. What people don&#39;t seem to get is that these characters lived in a racy era... where the rich were having affairs, were insanely drunk during prohibition, and were doing just as many scandalous/illicit activities if not even more than what celebrities do now. The music fits in my opinion, because it presents the seductively extravagant lifestyle the upper class of the roaring twenties had, in a way that the conservative jazz of the time could not. In this case, older music distances the protagonists of the story from the viewer, but using new music reminds us that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Myrtle, and Jordan are full of the same vibrant energy seen in the young and rich today.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaAmitabh bacchan
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaIs that Amitabh Bachchan !? Nice.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWhat Is The Name Of The First Song!
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaYay back to a time black ppl had to fight for their rights👍
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitai feel like this movie wouldve been better if it was jazz music...  when you watch this i want to be immersed in the jazz age that the 20&#39;s were known for
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaLOL

4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitait was really good 9/10 only because of some music choices that didn&#39;t fit the theme
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThis has nothing to do with classic literature and would only make a weak mind think.  Leonardo Dicaprio? Rap crap? hahahahahahahahaha
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaMy school is in the trailer... not really relevant but I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this so much :)
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWouldn&#39;t miss it for the world.  That said, a small request: Mr. Luhrmann: VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshita0:33 the sultan from Aladdin?
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshita&quot;No Church In The Wild.&quot; Kanye West, Jay-Z, &amp; Frank Ocean.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitalooks good
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI want to go see this really bad
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaoops

4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitafuck me right
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitasorry i was wrong

4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitasorry i was wrong
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitahe isn&#39;t... just because one of his songs is in a trailer don&#39;t assume he is producing all the music for it...
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so glad Jay-Z is producing the music for this film!!! :))
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThe first song is No Church In The Wild by Jay-Z and Kanye West
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaAmazing ! Great trailer !
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the first song?
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes the storyline seem more epic than it is, but I really look forward to seeing this
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaWell, &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot; by U2 covered by Jack White.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaoohh! Leonardo DiCaprio and tobey maguire in one movie! ♥ 
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a train wreck.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaMay it was suppose to come out this year. WTF 
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaYeah, you&#39;re probably right. I really want to see The Hobbit anyway.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaway too much CGI. hard to buy it as a period piece.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a remake. This is Baz Luhrmann&#39;s adaptation of the novel. It absolutely is NOT a remake of Clayton&#39;s 1974 film. There are significant style and tonal differences between both films.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks nothing like what I pictured in my head while reading Gatsby. I really like it though. The style fits it very well. I love how vibrant all the colors are.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaSeeing as The Hobbit is releasing in December, I say they made the right move.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaREMAKE of Gatsby
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaHopefully we get more signature stupid Tobey Maguire faces from this movie.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitawhy did they change the release date, seriously?!

4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI do hope that God awful music at the beginning of the trailer is not in the film.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaMAY?!?!?!
God dangit warner brothers.
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaLove is blindness by jack white
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitawhat is the second song in the trailer?
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitaThird :P
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitai literally would have seen django unchained and the great gatsby both on christmas day :(
4w8lohkQtbYdelimeterByIshitabuena

whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThere is a reason Stoker was mentioned last.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the soundtrack
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaIn Japanese-occupied Korea, a conman operating under the sobriquet of &quot;Count Fujiwara&quot; hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee from a family of con artists to become the maid of the mysterious Japanese heiress Lady Hideko, whom Fujiwara plans to marry and to commit to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. Sook-hee, taking on the name &quot;Tamako&quot;, enters Hideko&#39;s household, which is controlled by her authoritarian Uncle Kouzuki. Hideko is haunted by the suicide of her aunt, and claims to hear her voice at night. As Sook-hee and Hideko spend more time together, they appear to get along well, Hideko allowing Sook-hee to wear her dresses and jewelry. Hideko is also anxious about marrying Fujiwara, her feelings for him not very strong, but Sook-hee makes passionate love to her, promising her the same pleasures with her new husband. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about following through with the plan, unhappy over the feigned attraction Fujiwara has for Hideko. Hideko herself feels that she cannot go through with the marriage, but Sook-hee insists she do so, causing Hideko to slap her and run away in frustration. Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, reminding Hideko to &quot;always remember the basement.&quot; Hideko and Fujiwara elope soon afterward and consummate their marriage, as indicated by a small blood stain on Hideko&#39;s sheets the following morning. After cashing out Hideko&#39;s inheritance, Sook-hee, Hideko, and Fujiwara travel to the asylum, but Sook-Hee is taken away by the staff, having been told that she is in fact Hideko. After being left with one piece of jewelry by Hideko, Sook-hee curses them as she is carried away.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitawhen the trailer is fucking fire.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitahow many of you here after keshava trailer
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitalooks like &quot;a memoirs of geisha&quot;
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaWell then
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaMmm, catchy.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie... watched it last night...
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaCongrats on winning Baeksang!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaholy fuck this movie was good
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this, Tarantino and Park Chan Wook are my favourite directors and this was AMAZING.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is so good that I had to go back to the trailer to say how good it is.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitajust as awesome and twisted as the movie.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaA good trailer that doesnt give you the whole movie in 2 minutes? <br>Wow!<br>Totally different from American producers
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitagood trailer! better than the film...
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaPark Chan-wook deserved an Oscar for this film.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitasee hollywood.. this is how a trailer must be!!!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m addicted to this trailer. Also, the movie is a fucking MAGIC!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitathis message will not come true for those who are AWAKE! Love &amp; Light
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI think it is better than Oldboy and Park&#39;s most splendid work so far. Even though Oldboy was stronger on an emotional level and had a greater impact on audience members, it is nonetheless in some parts cheesy and immature ( which Park himself admitted in the booklet of the Plain Archive limited BluRay of Oldboy) whereas The Handmaiden is cinema at its best. There is not a single flaw that I could point out and it&#39;s definitely his most mature and professional film.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaAfter finally having seen the movie in a theater I am starting to hate this trailer because it made me expect a completely crazy and intense movie. What I got instead was very satisfying but I had still been misled by the trailer.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer = 10/10<br>This movie = 11/10
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaSoundtrack: Vessels- Red sex. Made a huge impact to this trailer.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie out there! Unexpected plot twist i have ever <br>watched! but the sweetness of the lesbian couple are adorable <br>emotionally and sexually and most of all a happy ending for them! A <br>recommendation of happy ending lesbian theme with no cheating and <br>acceptance from family and friends are transit girls, yes or no and <br>hormones 3 &quot;koi and dao&quot;.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI really liked this film, but I loved the trailer!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaanother masterpiece crafted by Park chan-wook. every aspect of this movie is beautiful. but still can&#39;t beat the &quot;Oldboy&quot;
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshita&quot;This is not a movie for grandma. La La Land is a movie for Grandma&quot; - ralphthemoviemaker
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThis film was unbelievably good.  This trailer alone deserves an award.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaSong ?
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe writers and directors these days are so unbelievably retarded. That was the worst trailer that I have seen in awhile. COMMON SENSE SAYS THAT THE TRAILER IS SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU WHAT THE F_CK THE MOVIE IS  A-B-O-U-T ! ! ! That trailer told nothing of what the movie is about.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaRalphthemoviemaker? Anyone?
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe film is all around gorgeous, but I&#39;ll give a little more credit to Chan-wook Park, his direction is simply beautiful, delicate, femenist and autoritative and very much his own. There&#39;s so much passion and gusto in every frame, it&#39;s a delight to watch.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaHadn&#39;t seen a good movie in a long time. This one left me breathless.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaShit looks creepy and scary? Lol or is it just about sex? Haha
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is as good as the film <br>Amazing film indeed
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaFor a place in Canne make a film with lesbian
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitathis is by far the best theme song on a trailer since snatch
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know this was inspired by Fingersmith by Sarah Waters but now I want to see it even more!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is a piece of art in itself. Amazing.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was good yes but my god was it wierd
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is fucking amazing.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaOscuramente perversa y perturbadora, sus escenas son como óleos hacia los cuales la cámara recorre cada detalle con formidable fluidez. Recomendamos ponerse pitet y prepararse para saborear un delicado y exquisito bocado, tan sólo apto para los paladares más exigentes. Entre lo mejor de la cosecha de este año, para repetir más de una vez. El Maestro Coreano en plena forma (<a href="http://www.travellingcircular.com">www.travellingcircular.com</a>)
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitabut the trailer tells you absolutely fuck all about what the movie is about although its reputation alone makes me want to go see it.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t want to see the trailer until after I had seen the movie. The flick was phenomenal and holy shit that trailer was pretty damn great too!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitashould have added the clip when they put the bells in their mouths. would have been better.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaMan does Park Chan-Wook know how to shoot a movie, every shot in the movie is just beautiful
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaHonestly the best trailer I&#39;ve seen since Mad Max: Fury Road. Can&#39;t wait to see this on Thursday.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaWhat a terrible trailer. I have no idea what the movie is about at all.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaGoddamn, that music is annoying as fuck.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaKind of look cliche
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThanks, Alachia.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaGreat, an amazing trailer that doesn&#39;t have that Inception sound!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaone of the best songs from vessel!
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitacrap, lady doesn&#39;t look and act japanese at all.

whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitajust finished watching fingersmith  which this novel based on and loved and am looking forward to watching this adaptuon
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t like it much. Park shows the inner child side of him. I appreciate it. &#39;Thirst&#39; was on another level. This film seems to be more accessible.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThe master returns to show western audiences what a real movie is.
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaCreepy in a good way
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitathree important things I have learned from this movie- 1. do not go to the basement. 2. cigarettes kill you especially that are wrapped in blue paper. 3. bells have multiple use 😜
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was amazing in every aspect !
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaamazing trailer
whldChqCsYkdelimeterByIshitaHow good does this look?

vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaanother year for leo to just sit there.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so sad, looking at Steve Carell&#39;s face. Why would he do that?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaToo much Just For Men :S
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitapaulson shorted thr housing market by shorting fannie may. alot of folks saw this coming i was reading article after article about those bad loans. soon it will be sovereign debt which is far worse .
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSorry can&#39;t take this seriously after watching what he does in The Office
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSorry can&#39;t take this seriously after watching what he does in The Office
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitai thought it was a movie about gorge lucas ...
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitathe song in the trailer: where the levee breaks by led zeppelin.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the point of this movie, when there is a much better film &quot;Margin Call&quot;?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaDo we really want this movie?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita(yawn) long story short : Theres one set of rules for bankers, another set for the little guy. Bankers can literally DESTROY Western Civilization, but we cant fu%$in VAPE without the FDA up our rectums? Go FU%$ yerselves!!!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThis cast makes me moist
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaHollywood&#39;s obsession with Led Zeppelin continues.<br>First, &quot;Whole lotta love&quot; is used in the background of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation&#39;s trailer  and now &quot;When the levee breaks&quot; in The Big Short.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaWow this is the whitest movie ever
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaFInally a movie about how shitty wigs ruined the economy.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s hard to take Steve Carell seriously in this film lol
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitawigs are so distracting
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI hope this trailer isn&#39;t doing this movie justice because it looks like total crap.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaand Selena Gomez? .-.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a> the banks -- <b>AND THE US GOVERNMENT</b> -- got greedy!<br>why else is there still 0% interest rates; they are still being greedy!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is too long, sorry
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaChristian bale looks like Alex ich
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaWhat a shame this movie only blames the banks while the Federal Reserve and big government regulations caused the housing bubble.<br><br>The Housing Bubble in 4 Easy Steps<br>SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 Mark Thornton<br><br>1. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to as low as 1% so that after inflation we had negative interest rates.<br><br>2. As a result, mortgage rates fell to an all time low.<br><br>3. Low rates caused borrowing and lending to explode, particularly in real estate. For example, commercial banks more than doubled the amount of real-estate loans they made.<br><br>4. All these low interest loans had to be extended to people with worse credit ratings and this increased the demand for homes and other real-estate assets. It should not be surprising that home prices skyrocketed. Click on the link below to the Real Estate Roller Coaster:<br><br>Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, and credit derivatives were simply the conduit that made all these bad loans and investments seem less risky than they really were. In this manner the Federal Reserve can fool the market, at least temporarily. In the end the market always reasserts itself.<br><br><a href="https://mises.org/library/housing-bubble-4-easy-steps">https://mises.org/library/housing-bubble-4-easy-steps</a>
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<b>sigh</b> The banks took advantage of a stupid financial situation handed to them by politicians. They were no more greedy than every other American, they just took advantage longer. Tons of people saw the housing collapse coming.  When it all collapsed, and the politicians were saying &quot;no-one saw this coming,&quot; we are all looking around like &quot;what are they smoking this time?&quot; Next up, the higher education bubble and the stock market over-evaluation. I expect they&#39;ll blame those collapses on &quot;human greed&quot; too.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitamusic name please?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThis is somewhat lighthearted compared to other movies Bale has done. Looks good
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI hope John Paulson isn&#39;t left out of the story!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSCHMIDT!!!!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThe casting is impeccable. Christian bale as Michael burry, Steve Carrell as Steve Eisman, and Ryan Gosling as Greg Lippmann. They are going to recreate these characters perfectly on screen.  I think the only challenge would be scripting a story this complicated into a movie. I mean I read the book and has watered down has Michael Lewis tried to make it, it was still a challenging read.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaOh yaaaasss Christian Bale ❤️❤️❤️
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt looks a bit like Robert Redfort.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> mins into trailer and chill and he gives you this look ;) <br>Going to be an amazing movie &lt;3
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBe better than the GAP.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> that nose :o
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> Golsing goes full De Niro
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitacool
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitadose wigs tho
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else not able to take steve carrel seriously lol
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what is going through the banks but this types of movies make some shortcuts to make money....
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaUm excuse me, Brad Pitt has an Oscar, so how about labeling it, Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt, these filmmakers really screwed the pooch on this trailer, but otherwise, excited for the film.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;When the levee breaks&#39;&#39; ? I&#39;m fucking watching this.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaChristian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt with Steve Carrel in an Adam Mckay movie?? Woah. This seems pretty interesting.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBlimey, I didnt realise that was Brad Pitt until his name came up.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitawolf of wall street 2, wheres Dicaprio? XD
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBale, Pitt, Gosling, Carrell... <br><br>Now that&#39;s what I call Christmas..
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaStellar cast
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSo a bunch of guys in the business figured out the shortfall before everything fell through and managed to capitalize on it themselves...   but this trailer makes it seem that the movie is going to portray them as anti-capitalism heroes somehow.  Smart guys and congrats to them for seeing the problems with the system and making it to their benefit but come on Hollywood.  No need to misrepresent what was really happening.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing I got from this is those actors changed their hair.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitawhitest white man movie ever lmaoo &quot;OH NO THE BANKZ IM GONNA LOOZ MY MONEYS!!&quot;
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSchmidt!!!!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna watch this movie just because of Ryan Gosling and Selena Gomez
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaChristian Bale looks like Steve Oedekerk from Kung Pow.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaB@nKs r teh ev1ilz!!!11 <br><br>Spare us from this anti-capitalism horseshit.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaFinally a good looking movie.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaNow Paramount Pictures will probably make insane money from this too. They did release The Wolf of Wallstreet. Yes, the business of movies is to often offend, but how many times? At this point, this is just malicious and poor choice by the actors and their advisers; bunch of millionaires playing in a movie about rich people screwing over the poor and middle class. Nicely done! Terrible wigs too!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaChristian Bale is the best actor of this generation and it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s going to win another Oscar for this.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBruce Wayne, Tyler Durden and Michael Scott playing with finance and shit.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaMichael Scott as Prison Mike co-stars in The Big Short. A Michael Scott production.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaChristian Bale has yet again transformed himself for a role. Bravo.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitawhere is selena?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaПервый в мире трейлер, который я устал смотреть.:-(
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI forgot Adam McKay directed this. Wow.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaYou know I would enjoy this movie if it didn&#39;t have Steve Carrel or Ryan Gosling in it.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThey must think it has a shot at the Oscars if they`re releasing it in December.Really like the look of this.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should have been called &quot;The Wig&quot;.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaOh wow, after watching this trailer that sums up 70% of the movie i am VERY tempted to watch it.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBatman vs Superman dawn of justice is better then this
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaWill watch just because of the cast!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita&gt;Adam Mckay<br>&gt;outrageous mind<br>Are you serious?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSelena Gomez &lt;3 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=1m23s">1:23</a>
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Lloyd Blankfein??
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaIght fam but who is the main character in this lol
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitavote for bernie sanders
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitahey, brad pitt might actually play an interesting character again!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaMichael Scott smartened up!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaGreatest cast ever.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt has finally completed his transformation into Robert Redford
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaSoo glad to see Christian Bale do good movies again
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaAdam McKay without Will Ferrell is like Dennis Dugan without Adam Sandler.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitalol..great actor in there.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt looks like Philip Seymour Hoffman
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI saw selena&#39;s hands &amp; boobs I&#39;m freaking out.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaThe Wolf of Wall Street - Dark Edition
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaEr, where are all the women?
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q&amp;t=1m23s">1:23</a> is selena
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaMargin Call 2: This Time It&#39;s Personal
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaAdam McKay should be proud of himself. this freaking cast is any and i mean ANY director&#39;s dream come true.
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitachristian bale looks different...awesome........................and cute............what a cast
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaI came her to see Selena
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaBrad is an academy award winner, not just a nominee

vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaOh, what a cast... what a lovely cast!
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaOMG FUCKİNG CAST
vgqG3ITMv1QdelimeterByIshitaLed Zeppelin!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaPeople are very strange these days. I used to know a girl; she had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it... beat her up so bad she ended up in a tiny room on Guerrero Street.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI am probably an emotional wreck after seeing this movie. Loved the book and can&#39;t wait to see the adaptation. Heard a lot of good things about it.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaIncredible, but it didn&#39;t need the ten F-words. THe book had no language at all.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t see this before beginning to read the book! The whole terror of the first half is that I had no idea what would happen - &quot;Will they escape? But there&#39;s so much of the book left! Oh my gosh I&#39;m so stressed?!?!&quot; All of that gets taken away from this one trailer. :/
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaBoth Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay work so well together, you can&#39;t help but feel a sense of great release when the two of them emerge from the room where they&#39;ve been held captive, but it&#39;s the child&#39;s point of view that reaches something unusually stirring within.  There&#39;s something about that boy, as played by Jacob Tremblay, that just rings true with all his inner wisdom and joy at greeting the sink and the inanimate objects as if they were real, even referring to &quot;room&quot; as if it were a living thing.  The writing, of course, achieves that type of transcendence, and the directing makes it real, and it all hits home in highly personal and touching ways.  It&#39;s quite an emotional ride.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaIM CRYING AND IT JUST THE TRAILER
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaBawling my eyes out while holding my one year old!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaBrie Larson has to AT LEAST be nominated for an academy award for this. She&#39;s way better than some of the previous winners.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI had a similar experience with my mother who tried to sabotage my relationships/jobs/health etc. and keep me dependent on her so she&#39;d have companionship.<br><br>Like the movie misery.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI think that it is very wise to name this movie Room. In fact it is very wiseau to name this movie room.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOh my god this just said everything i havent read in the book!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOh my god this just said everything i havent read in the book!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI wonder will this movie be like the book.  I can&#39;t wait to see this movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOh hai Mark!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitacut that peckerheads hair
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWait is she a boy or a girl cause that kapt saying &#39;he&#39; ot is she trans
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitanice nice nice :))
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaare they sure that&#39;s a boy?!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis was an amazing and immensely sad book, I&#39;m glad they finally made it into a movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitai love this book soooooo much. can&#39;t wait for the film
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be pissed off If the dog dies
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a boy?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI hope this little boy wins an Oscar.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaJust read the book and it was quite good! Looking forward to the movie!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI have heard anything about this movie will it ever be on dvd
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI want to go see this at an obscure time when the theatre&#39;s empty and cry and not make eye contact with anyone. The only way I&#39;ll be able to get through such an emotional film.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaBrie and Joan will receive Oscar nominations, I think...
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWow ... this is nothing that I imagined when I was reading it lol
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaLoved it because &quot;This Will Destroy You&quot; xD
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitafinally the film version is here!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI read the book nearly 3 years ago and I loved it very much, I am very excited to see the movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna watch this because I literally could not stop reading the book and finished it in two days, but the book had me balling my eyes out, so I hope it translates well to film. It looks promising.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI have been waiting so long for this book to be a movie!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitais the background song by Ms Mr?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWats the song
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitait was a great book! hopefully the movie will be good too!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWhat?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song towards the end?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Oscar bait. I can tell the whole story already and I&#39;ve never read the book. Boring.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitai am in tears!!!! cannot wait for this
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks really good, but....geez, the trailer gives away most of the plot!! If you haven&#39;t already read the book, and don&#39;t know that Ma and Jack get out of the room, well you do after watching this :/
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never gone so fast from thinking &quot;oh cool a new movie trailer&quot; to being a 30 year old man crying at his desk at work
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitalistening to the music I thought I saw the Moneyball trailer
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitathis movie has written Oscar all over it acting directing story
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitagreat great GREAT book! so happy they made this a movie!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaCan we just give Brie Larson her Oscar already?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaROOM was one of the most haunting books I ever read (and I don&#39;t really read much), and Brie Larson was so incredible in Short Term 12... sure hope she&#39;ll get the recognition she deserves
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d rather watch Tommy Wiseau&#39;s version.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI read this book and I really hope the movie is as great as the book
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaYESSSS I&#39;ve been waiting forever to see this wonderful book turned into a movie... I&#39;m gonna have the feels all over again
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitawelp. The ruins the surprise. And pretty much all that was suspenseful about the book. I mean sure their adaptation to normal life was intriguing but mostly because you spent the whole first half wondering if they&#39;d ever escape
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI read this book in high school...i wanna see the movie now
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWho know what&#39;s the music at last! Thank you so much!!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWhen trailers make you cry! Beautiful!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaCrying all over again
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitawhat was the second song playing at 1.33
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI started and finished this book today, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to stop thinking about it for a while.  I&#39;m now excited for this movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThey spoiled the entire fucking book lol
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this book called?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitahaha what a story joy
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song at the end of the trailer????
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m literally crying right now. I have read the book so many times and now that theres a movie coming out, I can&#39;t even..
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWatched a scene from this movie being filmed at the Bramalea City Centre in Brampton. Looks like it will be an excellent movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was absolutely amazing! Saw it at TIFF and have not been able to get it out of my head. I&#39;m disappointed in what a complete spoiler this trailer is though
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song in this trailer!?!?!?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaRoom has won the TIFF People&#39;s Choice Award. Just to put that in perspective, when you look at the last seven films to have won the award, six of them have gone on to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, with three of them actually winning.<br><br>I&#39;m just saying.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThe better part of this book is about adapting to the outside world. If the trailer was just them in the room it would&#39;ve felt incomplete. The story isn&#39;t centered on their escape, it is about their adjustment to life after it.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI AM SO EXCITED
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWow it looks amazing.<br><br>Brie Larson should seriously be considered for a Lead Actress Oscar nomination come next year..<br><br>Lord knows she was snubbed for Short Term 12.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t even wait to watch this
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if the novel was at all inspired by the case of Josef Fritzel, who had locked his daugher up in his basement for twenty years and in that time raped her repeatedly. She raised three children in his basement until finally she managed to alert the world that she was trapped in there; I suspect the show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt might be inspired by that case as well.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a shame that the trailer basically gives away the whole storyline but I&#39;m so excited for this. I read it in Contemporary Fiction class. Ahh!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitacan someone please tell me the music from this trailer???!!!!!<br>it is so good!!!!<br>i looked for it everywhere just can&#39;t find the name!!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaIn the first 30 seconds you can already tell they did the movie wrong. This book is FULL of very specific details regarding even the exact appearance of the first man Jack runs into Outside. It&#39;s not that hard to find a non-white actor, Hollywood!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWhy would they show that they escaped in the trailer?? Thank God I read the book before watching this. If people watched this trailer and they only saw that they were in the room, it would be a total surprise in theaters when they see they actually escape and get to live in the real world.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI get the major chills at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ci-pAL4eE&amp;t=1m15s">1:15</a>
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaone of the most heart trembling books I&#39;ve ever read!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThe book kept me in suspense about the how things were going to turn out.  Disappointed that the trailer gives it away.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis was a great book! I can&#39;t wait to see this!<br>I love to see great books come to life 📚👉🎬
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis was such a great book.  One little thing I hope that is mentioned  in the film is Jack&#39;s bendy spoon.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaThis is such a beautiful interpretation of such a GODAFWUL thing.<br> I can&#39;t help it. I don&#39;t even know if I can watch the movie. I cried so hard through the preview. <br>I will try very hard to, I know if I start I will be compelled to. I have to ask though is Jack a boy, or a girl? So far, it&#39;s never made clear. And, of course it doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m just curious.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaBeen waiting since 2011 when I read this book for the movie to come out!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaYOU ARE TEARING ME APART JOY!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t this a book
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOMFG SOMEONE I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED TO<br> THIS MOVIE!!!!!1
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitathis looks so wonderful
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaReminded me of Taliban women....
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the music that plays in the beginning part of the trailer?
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitayesss!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOHM Y FUCKIGN GOD IVE BEEN WQAITNG 4 YEARS TO SEE THIS HEEEELPPP
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song?!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaOh hi mark!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone where can i watch this movie???
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitathey tell all The story on the trailer!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaher name is joy!!!
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaNot sure how I feel about this immediately spoiling the second half of the book. It&#39;s what makes the first half so intense--at least for me. Looks like a potentially solid translation to film, but there are some things a novel can do that a film simply cannot.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaso emotional. song: ms mr: all the things lost
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaLOVE hearing MS MR in the trailer. So excited for this movie.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaI can not wait to see this.
E_Ci-pAL4eEdelimeterByIshitaSomebody please help: what is the name of the track playing between <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ci-pAL4eE&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ci-pAL4eE&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> ?
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie! Just got back from seeing it....and it just fucks around with your mind, but it&#39;s really amazing. The end turned out so different from what you expect and it really makes you think. Loved it :)
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaIt Was An Amazing Movie ! :D 
Great Plot &amp; Twist at the end.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitareally really good. great plot and story. i went in thinking one thing was going to happen and i left knowing something completly different. honestly it&#39;s very good. don&#39;t listen to people who say it sucks.. i would give this a 8.5/10
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaA masterpiece!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathis movie is great and it messes with your head it is not a horror movie or in any way scary go see it
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaIts &quot;nice&quot;? Um, I don&#39;t think thats the word to describe this movie. Are you sure you saw &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and not something else? Like &quot;Dear John&quot;?
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitagonna see it later today i can&#39;t wait =D
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI read the book and I&#39;ve gotta say that this is going to be one of the best movies. It reflects almost 100% of the book&#39;s mood and story. I had a shiver running down my spine while watching this..
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitawas that a cameo by DiNero? Wow! another Scorsese/DiCaprio flick. Paranoia high, violence, mad shrinks! can&#39;t wait to see it this weekend!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaSo, Shutter Island=Awesomeness!! I highly recommend it!! The best way I can
describe it is The Shining if it took place at a prison for the criminally insane. And creepier. Great movie!!

I just saw the midnight showing, GO SEE IT!!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaLOUD NOISES!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is sooo creepy- I&#39;m going to see it tomorrow night :D
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaLOOKS GREAT CANT WAIT 2 SEE IT!!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe lady that says sssshhh is Opal from All My Children.  Just sayin&#39;. =D
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaGo to hell, I rather see the movie on the big screen
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaguy scared shit out of me with stapels in his face
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a good adaptation of the book. Jackie Earle Hayley is perfect for Noyce. Though I&#39;m not sure about DiCaprio. We&#39;ll have to wait and see I guess.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitadamn.. this movie look like da sh**.... awsome!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaBasically it is the concept of the game FEAR taken and put into a little different setting. Will be great :)
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer gives me chills everytime ! when im just sitting watching it with headphones in the dark. So Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio working together again every movie they have made together was great The Aviator, Gangs of New York, and The Departed Im sure this movie will be awesome
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Nard.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaits rated R
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaim seeing this in two days
cannot wait!!!! hahaha
it looks amazing, not scary, but thrilling.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThis was a book origianlly and its amazing and go see the movie the ending is the most amazing ending of any book or movie ever
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaWell it looks like a promising movie,the trailer does give alittle to much away but it still seems worth watching
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI can tell you the story, I suppose it is same with the Turkish &quot;GEN&quot;. The doctors and guards are actually patients who hold in capture the actual staff.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaGreat, the entire movie laid out.  No surprises, I see the entire plot.

No reason to see this now.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe book was fucking amazing. I hope the movie adaptation lives up to it. Of course, it is Scorcese here. So if its going to happen, I&#39;m glad they got the master of filmmaking to do it.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI can never remember his real name.  But yeah, you remember him from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?


&quot;I&#39;ll never call golf a dull game again!&quot;  Heh heh.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaa marty scorcese horror film. i cant wait

5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaNo, I believe that&#39;s Casey Jones.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaNazi experiments on Jews  is probably where the story starts off. What do u think?
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitayou tryna crap your pants? i&#39;d go see this movie

5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshita@disneyyisloveex3 Doesn&#39;t matter what the trailer hinted, I&#39;ve read the book and the ending will rock you, it&#39;s so much more than what you think.

5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathis is crazy
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathis is based off the book Shutter Island, and if its like the book, there will be a HUGE twist
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe ending is surprising. You&#39;d never guess what&#39;s the whole event is about.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaMatt and Leo!! You can`t get no wrong

5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaINSANE MOVIE!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaIt happened also on the US because of lack of money from Paramount to do proper marketing and also hoping economy will be better and people will start going to see good films (not only kiddie blockbusters) again.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m also amazed at how DiCaprio&#39;s become such a badass actor, and I think he&#39;s way better than Jack ever was.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaReading the book right now, Teddy&#39;s just taken those pills for a killer migraine.
What?
Was that De Niro reprising his role as The Frankenstein Monster?
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitascrew all theese spammers. get a life

5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaNo its not De Niro  .. its that guy who kinda looks like him.  It&#39;s Elias Koteas. Google magic my friend.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaMs Cat I totally agree.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaMark Ruffalo reminds of Marlon Brando
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitai hope leo gets an oscar 4 this, he finally deserves one!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathis looks good
love leo
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaWow! Looks spooky. I don&#39;t like horrors or that kind of movies, but with Leo and M.Ruffalo, directed by Scorsese.... I must see it!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitascorcese loves leo

looks fuckin great
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitacant wait for this
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaman ive been waitin for this movie for about 4 months now! it said back then that is was to suppose to come out on oct 2! well it passed, still no movie! then i watch this and it says feb of 2010!!!!!!!!! wtf! 2 more months i gotta wait!!!!!!!!!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathat leo is one bad ass mofo
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitadude it&#39;s SCORSESE, i could guarantee you there&#39;s more too it than the fucking trailer
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitalol xD
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe guy at 1:38 seconds looks like my uncle
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitahella good book just finished it. mind-boggling.

An extremely smart book i think the movie could do a great job
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaseems to be a really cool movie!
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI reminds me of Silent Hill

The colors mostly
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe book was amazing you should read that first before seeing the movie gives much more detail
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitalooks so god danm good.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitalemme guess, leo ends up bein one of the crazys.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaGuys, really. I read the book, and I can PROMISE YOU. No matter how cliched this movie looks like its going to be, it will boggle your mind.

I could sleep the night after reading it because it was so captivating and intense that I simply couldn&#39;t make my brain shut off.

This movie looks amazing, and I&#39;m SO EXCITED to see one of my favorite books movified by such a great cast and crew.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitait was going to come out in October so they probably made it look like a horror movie because of Halloween. The date got pushed back though. I read the book it&#39;s nothing like a horror movie so don&#39;t worry it&#39;ll be awesome.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s true..as i mentioned in my comment, they probably made the trailer look that way on purpose, but there&#39;s not even indication of any shots that arent plain or cliched- fingers crossed it WILL be good- maybe i&#39;ll wait until the dvd to check it out though..
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaWell, trailers are always made to attract the greatest number of people - that&#39;s why they generally look generic and stupid. I would not pass judegement on the film quite yet.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitagod....so disappointed- only because it&#39;s a Martin Scorcese movie- fuck, that guy&#39;s made some true, true masterpieces- this looks like it could have been directed by anybody. if it was by some no name horror director i might not expect so much, but this looks so cliched. Hopefully they made the trailer in the style of other horror films on purpose and the actual movie plays in a muc classier and stylish way,with the kind of flair shown in Goodfellas or Raging Bull...we shall see.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitadamn looks good looks goood
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch it!!looks so cool!!xD
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaDamn, that looks good. I wish it would come out before christmas.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the book called?
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitado you know this for sure or are you one of those people that can guess a whole movie by seeing 3 seconds of it
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitalooks like we have a blockbuster in our hands. Great movie, great actors, great photography, great sountrack.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaI wonder what the twist is and who will spoil the movie for me by telling me before hand.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks hella sweet/crazy
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaFinally a film worth looking forward to.

Live Forever...
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitascorsese rules
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaReally excellent book. This is the first movie I will be looking forward too next year.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitabut i don&#39;t like running.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty scary gonna have to see it.
5iaYLCiq5RMdelimeterByIshitaThe book is awesome , I really wish the movie will do it justice !
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLooks low effort. Seems like a blatant cash grab and you already know they are going to make sequels...
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI can’t flipping wait for this movie lol
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitathe way they switch to the side mouth is so cool<br><br>sonic, take notes
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI like the voices, they cool :}
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYOOO THIS LOOKS GREAT
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad Disney is balancing out the universe after making terrible live-action remakes of awesome animated movies by making awesome animated remakes of terrible live-action movies.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaCool
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYou know, this actually works. This helps solve the problem of the actors getting older and looking too old, voice acting solves that entirely.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly looking forward to this!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOk. I like the voice acting and animation, but the art style is a little weird. Overall, not bad of a trailer :)
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYESS<br>Since I Read Diary Of Wimpy Kid :  Paradise Island.<br>(Paradise Island Is It Right Because I Did Not Read The Title Carefully🙂)<br>I Am Obsessed With It Books, Movies And Now This 🤩🤩🤩<br><br>Edit : My Mistake It Was Diary Of Wimpy Kid : Get Away<br>Not Paradise Island But You Got The Point
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLet’s Goooooo!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYoo this is sick!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaSo happy that they&#39;re finally using the original art style for the characters. They&#39;ve always hinted at this in the live action movies and I wanted to see it this way. Now we finally can.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOkay i like this🔥
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYes!<br>This is gonna be good!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshita17 minutes ago boys
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitada hora, gostei do estilo da animação. Irei assistir quando lançar
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s too late, Disney. The live-action versions gave me PTSD.<br><br>Cancel this.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI want to see cant wait
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWe eating good in December
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYheaaaaaaaaaaaaaa💌
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaIf manny doesn&#39;t run his own drug cartel in this movie, I&#39;ll riot

VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good not going to lie
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaIt’s coming out on my birthday, I can’t wait!!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaCinema incoming
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThey should have gotten Devon Bostick to voice Rodrick
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNo
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis is definitely the best way to continue this franchise!!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOk the animation looks good but why didnt you get the actor who played Roderick in the other Diary of the wimpy kid movie disney sometimes i dont get you that much
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYESS this looks awesome!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaawesome!!!!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;ve all been waiting for this
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaSo its a remake? Shame.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaIf they do a series it’ll be popular
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaDumb idea
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaHonestly looks way better than the real version 😃
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis is basically the first movie and book and the story is a bit changed
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s go... to the bedmobiles because we&#39;re going to Six Flags Great adventure in time for the holidays! We&#39;re going to the movies in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D this X-mas! Catch us if you can, Bon-Bon and your she-goats of certain doom! Bring on the Top floor! They want dangerously cheesy kind of victory, let&#39;s give our sirs a rewarding paychecks to afford all-new experiments in amazing superhero adventures like a gang of sidekick parrots! The world wants to get fast, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23letsgetfast">#LetsGetFast</a>! The wait is over and it&#39;s our turn to get slimed this time!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaGosh i remember reading the book this look unnervingly like it but animated in a peanuts movie inspired style
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis movie should never have been live action in the first place
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s do this
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNgl, i feel like live action fits Diary of a wimpy kid better
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaYESSS
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaBasically the movie but in animation form
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI read the books when i was in middle school and now i am here excited about this trailer when i am 21y/o
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNot too bad. I think I’ll check it out.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWow
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThe voices of Greg, Rowley, and Frank are perfect, <b>BUT THE ANIMATION IS UNHOLY NIGHTMARE FUEL!!!</b>
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaSuperb
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOoooh nice
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI Can&#39;t Wait to See This
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWHAAAAT
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOkay, Disney be guilty for their mistakes, but sometimes it&#39;s for the fans.<br>Thank you for that.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshita헐 윔피키드 ㅠㅠㅠ잼민이때 재밌게봤는데 추억이다 진심ㅠㅠ
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNo lie the animation looks nice. I just hope this film honors both Jeff&#39;s work and the series itself and not another cashgrab for Disney+. This is some of our childhood here
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOh God, the animation is so great. It really brings my childhood.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaCan you just make a new thing? Anything? Just make it something fresh
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI love those books and have the entire set. I can&#39;t wait to see them on big screen
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWell, the animation looks nice.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThats what we all waiting for.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaHey, this is much more better than The Long Haul.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThey lied I thought they were making this a series,besides that it actually looks pretty solid ngl
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaAaaaah childhood memories 😭
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaITS HERE!!!!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThe original live-action cast will always hold a special place in my heart.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis doesn&#39;t look too bad but the animation and voices are a little off, kind of reminds me of Captain underpants
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWill Zachary Gordon make a cameo at least?
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaEpic
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWhyd they just recreate the movie? Im confused
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaAh, I&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWho asked for this?
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaEveryone: we don&#39;t want live actions of animated movies<br>Disney: uno reverse
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLooks better than the live-action movies.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLove diary of a wimpy kid. I remember reading the books at school.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaLET&#39;S GO, BRANDON 🇺🇸🎯
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaHonestly while nothing will be just as good as the og films. This looks really good.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOooo Finally this so much better than live action animation just like book❤️❤️👌
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI kinda expected the animation to be like that peanuts movie since Disney already bought Fox so
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaThis is how the movie should’ve been made!!!!!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWe don&#39;t necessarily need this
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI don’t think it’s not that bad!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNgl Greg’s character design is so unnervingly to me
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaNot sure how i feel about the animation, but it looks good overall!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaare you going to make all of the books?
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaFinally. This is the Diary of a Wimpy kid we’ve wanted all along
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaWow... history is about to be rewritten
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaI love the Live action films but this looks good.
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOMG THE ARTSTYLE
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaOh man,<br>Here we go again!
VKhCPUa-glodelimeterByIshitaIm early right?<br>Im shocked that my childhood fav movie became cartoon😳

LvKvus3vCEYdelimeterByIshitaNice
LvKvus3vCEYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome Superbad Official Trailer.
LvKvus3vCEYdelimeterByIshitaStorytime: When I was 15 this movie came to theaters, and my younger brother and I had to see it. Asked our parents to see it, and they bought the tickets and dropped us off. We walked to the ticket taker and he took the tickets, and we thought we were in the clear. As we were walking, he asked to see my ID. I told him &quot;I forgot it&quot; and he said....&quot;Okay, well just don&#39;t come out of the theater.&quot; I said alright, and off to find a seat. My younger brother needed to take a piss about 30 minutes into the movie, and I told him &quot;go ahead and go, screw it.&quot; He was about to walk into the hallway, but when he opened the door, someone saw him and watched him come sit back down. The rest of the movie, a different employee would come in and stare at us for a good 60 seconds, and leave. Literally the worst movie going experience of my life.<br><br>Great movie though. I watched it comfortably when it came out on &quot;DVD&quot; and it was amazing. That menu though.
LvKvus3vCEYdelimeterByIshitaWell not interested

LvKvus3vCEYdelimeterByIshitaMclovin
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe these positive reviews now. I watched the film and it&#39;s one of most boring/sloppy thriller I&#39;ve ever watched in a while. Be careful, these reviews must be fake I don&#39;t know.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie. Great story and intense
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaThe movie that made MW2
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaAwful. It&#39;s ridiculously slow, to where it drags the whole way. Even the action sequences aren&#39;t exciting. We ended up speeding it up to 1.5x and it was still tedious. Endless long, slow panning shots across deserts and suburbs and cities. The filmmakers tried to be profound, but it just comes across as sappy, which is very out of tune, considering the subject matter. It easily could&#39;ve been 45 minutes shorter in the hands of a more talented director. Brolin&#39;s character is just a smiley psychopath, stuck in one superficial emotional gear without any nuance. Blunt was hardly any better, flat and boyish. She comes across as noble at first, but it&#39;s quickly obvious she&#39;s an emotionally dead woman living a seedy life, without self-respect or even much of a will to live. I wasn&#39;t sure why they bothered to cast a woman in this role at all, except maybe to meet some Hollywood quota. It felt off. Worse, she only seemed to be there to get beaten up and attacked over and over. :/<br><br>I can&#39;t believe this got such high reviews. It&#39;s literally dead on arrival. No high or low points, just flat-line all the way through. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLiterally the main inspiration of MW2019 and MW2022 even the trailer song
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaWhat a brilliant film. Script, casting, acting, music, cinematography, and direction. There&#39;s nothing like it. I love this film.

Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaIf anyone is here watching this in 2022, YOU NOTICE HOW THE EXACT SAME SONG WITH THE REMIX  WAS IS BEING PLAUED IN THE MW II  TEASER?

Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaWelcome to Juarez !!!!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaInstead of making movies about it why not put that production money into purchasing mercenaries to eliminate the cartels once and for all.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaWhy are clips of American Psycho being picked up as this movie?
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLOL. that guy looks like a spongy spoiled pushover.<br>&quot;master assassin&quot;
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitait looks promising
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaIf the Del Toros are woking on this film, then count me in.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitahe looks like a mexican james dean
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaHey look another film about Mexico that wasn&#39;t filmed in Mexico and stars a Puerto Rican playing a Mexican like usual with a white protagonist
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaSounds to me like the the same American&#39;s who voted for Obama are in denial, now that they realize they fucked up. You wonder what&#39;s wrong with our country, and now we know. Congratulations America!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLast time I checked, women aren&#39;t on tactical teams probably ANYWHERE, so why  pretend in this movie? Just sayin.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitacould&#39;ve sworn that was Robert Downy...
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitafuck you and your shitty mainstream brainwashing garbage
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitafor a min there i thought that was Brad Pitt :P
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaits always happens, good trailer but movie ends up been a 2 star. typical
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaWait so Brad Pit isn&#39;t in this?
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaI love this song!!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshita&quot;Nothing will make sense to your American ears.&quot;
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaRoger Deakins and Denis Villeneuve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitamost intense film of the year ! ! Apparently, the best cartel film ever made! can&#39;t wait! it will be amazing!!!!!!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaFrom the Capital of gun control propaganda comes a repulsively unrealistic representation of complete brutality and glorified weapon porn.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaThat was actualy jarez!!! (whatez in english form)
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaUgh, more petite small female. mega soldiers
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaBenicio Del Toro, aka Benny the Bull, I liked him since I saw him in The Way of the Gun.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good movie.......
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a great movie!!!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLooks great,   must see this one
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitai thought it was RDJ in the thumbnail...
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitahey!, two guardians of the galaxy character actors!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaI like how the trailer glides from the fact that Emily Blunt is our lead in this film...
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaOh no seems like good movie,but with Emily .......nah ,not worth to watch,not attractive at all.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaYeay more wanton Hollywood gun violence. Guns are cool! They make bad guys go away! They bring Justice! Bad movies wrap up conveniently with guns, not writing! Ask all the cast members there feelings about guns, and they all will say that guns are bad, and gun owners are evil or should be locked up. Consequence-free extrajudicial assassination is cool! USA USA USA... Boycott. (oh, Peace, moderators)...
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaBenicio has been in some movies lately. Pablo Escobar was pretty fucking good.

Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaWelfare has now become the highest paying entry-level job in 35 of the 50 states. &quot;There are , in America, 35 states who pay welfare recipients better than retail clerks, factory workers and fast food employees.

LOL
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaI have to say, Emily Blunt is really making a good transition into action roles. Between this and Edge of Tomorrow, she&#39;s getting pretty good at it.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitai thought he was Brad Pitt
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks sick...
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like El Paso, TX..
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another feminist crap load!
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaBig K.R.I.T. - Saturdays = Celebration is the name of the song used in the trailer, just in case anyone is wondering. Definitely worth a listen on its own.
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitagreat the americans are crying about cartels and drugs in mexico then they make a stupid movie about it
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaLove anything shot by Roger Deakins
Yfhu5JIxnZcdelimeterByIshitaDamn son

oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaThis film mostly at night, dark indoors, my eyes can&#39;t stand it.. I like all aliens, predators movies, but this one a big no
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaBetter than Alien: Ressurection and Alien3.
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaPrey Predator 5 perfect
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaAlternate Title<br>Predator vs Aliens: Requiem
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaYou think someone would re-edit this to make the lighting better
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaMost underrated movie. We need more of AVP.
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaChoose your side Alien or Predator
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaWe’re gonna need a bigger boat!
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaOld and classic are not the same thing. This movie sucked hard.
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaI have Unrated version
oqLM_21tqycdelimeterByIshitaTried to watch this three times now still haven&#39;t seen it. Still don&#39;t understand why it was filmed so dark. Not the vibe, you actually can&#39;t see anything.

7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaso cliche..girl falls for her drug dealer then is shocked when he&#39;s arrested and sent to prison and gets caught in between. Rookie mistake 101 - always keep it professional with ur dealer, the less you know about each other the better
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaThe annoying kid from Homeland
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaWatched it recently and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. It is raw, harsh, straightforward and honest. Morgan Saylor is sexy as hell esp as a blonde. Loved it.

7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaI really hated her in Homeland, Dana Brody the most annoying character ever made.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitam&#39;probably gonna watch this for anthony and just him...lmao
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitadead at the buzzfeed quote.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaMaybe they pitched the idea as a less intense &#39;Requiem for a Dream&#39;.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitapatay mong Duterte!
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaYeah, we get it  already: drug money and fun are bad.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaCan you imagine e the outrage if there was a movie that came out called &quot;black boy&quot;
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it was targeted at millennials. So it will probably be fucking awful.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaCOCAINE EVERYWERE 😀
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaWhy Laurens!?!?!
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me a little bit of &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;

7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitathis would be the best drug addicts...
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaRepublican bait.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaGreat! Another movie about drugs and prostitution that has no real story!
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitasong?
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaShe should have been named becky....she has good hair btw
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitawhite girls listen up
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitai see a normal life in the USA,   WOW,  THAT NEED TO CHANGE ,
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitacrappy music
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaA bit cliché, but like interesting<br>Looks like spring breakers mixed with indie new generation way of directing 
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaWhen I read the title I thought this was going to be a Kevin Hart comedy
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaUh oh.... Chris Noth looks like a bad guy!    :-(    lol
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaif this movie ends and this girl doesnt have HIV i would be very surprised,
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaOh yeah!!!
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaWatch, the mexican is going to go to jail but the white girl probably won&#39;t get locked up because of that privilege.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one who saw jimmy from hardocre henry at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzrDvaHGEA&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> ?

7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitafucking kid movie
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at the beggining?
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer reminds me of public school in the 1980&#39;s, only there were a lot more drugs and violence then.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie showing the glorification of the drug culture; no thanks, I don&#39;t support that shit...If I had it my way I&#39;d punish the dealers and peddlers the way they do in Singapore......Public hanging, the scumbags who deal dope are nothing but vermin and should be exterminated not coddled the way Obama does.... And they wonder why Chicago has become a war zone with more death and mayhem than the middle east that is why!!!!
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaawful movie .............
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaI saw Kids.. that was good enough for me.
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is true to life. Been down that road a few times
7dzrDvaHGEAdelimeterByIshitaabsolute trash...how about a movie about black girls fucking up? oh wait that would be racist...how about a movie about how horrible white girls are treated by black and Latino men ? oh wait that would be racist...funny how the truth is racist these days.

wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI need to rewatch it, hard to see the Ultimate cut in one sitting, but I didn’t like or dislike it. I don’t think it’s supposed to feel like a “meh whatever movie” the twist was predictable and that ending was just so weak. I don’t know, I think I need a rewatch. I don’t think I “got” this movie
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely brilliant film. Brilliant.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wglmbroElU0&amp;t=2m50s">2:50</a> hours of wasted time. So slow and drawn out....

wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaAny one watching 2019
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie, it&#39;s pretty good solid 7/10
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaMy jaw dropped while watching this. Easily one of the most well made trailers I’ve ever seen, if not the best. Great movie too.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita2019 anyone
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis was one of the stupidest superhero movies I&#39;ve seen.  Over an hour into it and still nothing has hardly happened that&#39;s worth watching.  It just drags on and on.  Don&#39;t waste your time on this one!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThe directors cut is best.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaIt really boring I fell asleep while watching this
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaAlready 10 years 😭
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI lost count of how many times I&#39;ve seen this film. I love it!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita<b>The World Will Look Up And Shout &quot;Save Us!&quot; And I&#39;ll Whisper &quot;No!&quot;</b>
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaBest superhero movie ever, Period!!!...
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWatchmen&gt;&gt;&gt;Marvels comedic movies
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaExistence of Life is a highly overrated phenomenon!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaMasterpiece cbm
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWhat song is this
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWatching it on 3rd January 2019
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita2019??anyone
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis movie should go back in theaters for a 10 year celebration
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaVery nice movie 😎👌🙌👈
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI remember i just bought the dark knight on dvd when it came out so i watched it again. And this was the trailer of the dvd. I loved The dark knight and watchmen. These 2 movies were so different.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWhy I didn&#39;t ever heard of this movie .... looks good
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis movies shits on any other pussified pg-13 superhero movies out there...... (except Nolan&#39;s Batman)
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaone of the most underrated, best movies of all time.<br><br>in my top ten.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaAwesome Movie Excellent But One Thing I Couldn&#39;t Under Stand The Comic Book Angle That Was Very Boring ...
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a parody
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWB hires Zack Snyder to direct DC movies but fires him because his films are too dark did WB not watch 300 or Watchmen? They turned Justice League into a kids Disney film.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita*Zack Snyder
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWe want that Snyder back
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaZack Snyder the goat
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitagreat for those 12 and under.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita&quot;Why would I save a world I no longer have any stake in?&quot;
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaRemember when DC and Warner Bros made great movies. Pepper Ridge farm remebers.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawhy god, did such a shitty director have to make the best comic book into a movie...
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s 2018 and now I am watching the trailer ...
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaGreat movie. I hate Rorschach’s voice though
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaNon of them
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaIt’s on another level compares to MCU
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaStill looks good who&#39;s watching this in 2018!!!!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaPhilip Glass ❤
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaRorschach &lt;3
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitafor me, It is epic.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitathe narrator&#39;s voice is so stupid and ridiculous I can&#39;t even take this seriously, I just keep laughing.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaA time when heroes become legends.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita2018  ??? anyone ?
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita33 people were locked in with Rorschach
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaFavorite movie
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprised that no one has commented that they killed Negan
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaA justice league movie vision destroyed by the studio...
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI still prefer the first trailer I saw with the Smashing Pumpkins song in it, that&#39;s one if the best trailers I&#39;ve ever seen.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaOne of the best superhero films of all time and one of the most underrated of Zach Snyder&#39;s films!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitathough it was the gta 4 trailer
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaOne of the few films to exceed expectations and then some. Marvel films come and go but Watchmen is untouchable.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThe song is called &quot;take a bow&quot; by &quot;MUSE&quot;
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitamore darkness
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawhat name soundtrack in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wglmbroElU0&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a> ? please
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaTo me, this is the best movie ever made. Simple as that.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaCouldn&#39;t believe his trailer and it&#39;s movie had included with Koyaanisqatsi Music
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaGreat movie of the time
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawhen this movie was released i was only 8 yrs old, i asked my parents to take me to see it but they said it was for adults and they went to see it just the two of them. i just saw this movie a couple months ago its truly amazing and i am surprised i myself sat through the whole movie without getting bored, any other 15 or 16 yr old like me would have wanted to stop watching it. i give it a fucking 10/10.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaAnd then Zack Snyder became Hack Snyder......
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawill watchmen appear in dceu as alternate universe
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wglmbroElU0&amp;t=00m28s">00:28</a> LMAO at that blue guy!!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitabetter than man of stool don of justsidhs
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaim sorry im new with the word underrated/overrated what does that mean? is it a positive word or negative ?😂
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitathis trailer is one of my favorites ever, i just wish the movie was as good as the trailer or the comic.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThe best was to watch it is on the director cut on bluray . I wish DC would do a prequel with  just Rorschach  and the Comedian .
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThere saying that they might make a prequel HBO series to explain what happened way before watchmen, Before Watchmen is the title btw
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawachman is supongo vanoss because vanoss uses nightowl
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis is a bit of drama and not alot of action. Shame on you Zack Snyder.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wglmbroElU0&amp;t=1m16s">1:16</a> what&#39;s the song?
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWhen Christopher Reeves died, I cried at the end of my shift. Some of the other aides cried too. We all cried together.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis is the best movie made... Ever!
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaInteresting how Paramount distributed a DC movie. Paramount distributed Marvel movies as well. I guess that makes it marked in History as the first company to distribute both Marvel and DC movies lol.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshita*Zack, nod Zac.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaNever ReBoot this movie.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaProbably the one of the Most Underrated DC Movies of All-Time.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWhats Negan doing there? Hes supposed to be watching over Batfleck
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaGreatest CBM ever !
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaLol i like how people say that Comedian dying in the trailer gave away his death, fuck tards, if you read the comics, you&#39;d know he died
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI can only imagine how much people were hyped up for this movie when this trailer came out.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitawhy have I never heard of this movie before 2016....looks awesome
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWatchmen and Suicide Squad trailer are better than all these MCU movies.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWas that owlman
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite movie. truly underrated.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaThe trailer almost looks better than the movie,
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaWAtch this movie y&#39;all ! It&#39;s better than it might seem
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaOne of the most overlooked and underrated comic book films ever. A truly daring and unconventional film.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaBeautiful.
wglmbroElU0delimeterByIshitaI freaking love this movie. <br>I saw this movie when it came out, and I was blown away. I read the classic graphic novel, twice, in preparation for this movie, and I think recreated many key moments from the comics perfectly. 
8iCwtxJejikdelimeterByIshitaI stop watching the trailer, too awesome.  NEED TO SEE IT NOW! 
8iCwtxJejikdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song 1:40

8iCwtxJejikdelimeterByIshitaDamn, that&#39;s a hot Dimple!!!

LOL the best XD
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaIf it will only wipe out 1/2 of mankind and only mankind then this is not even close to an extinction level event. You can&#39;t really use the word &quot;extinction&quot; if nothing goes extinct
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitadunno why, but the trailer isn&#39;t really interesting :(
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaBertrand Zobrist was definitely right for his project. Firstly, read the book please.Than watch the movie.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitafarandula
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this looks dumb. The writing feels way too forced.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaYes it&#39;s a sequel to the da Vinci code and angels and demons, yes this trailer just gave away the entire movie, in less than 4 minutes yes wtf the whole thing is a complete disaster giving away important plots that revealed 99.9&#39;% of the action,no garuntee the rest will be talking and pointing at sh1t
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaShould I read the book before the movie? But I don&#39;t want any spoilers tho :(
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaDON&#39;T WATCH THIS TRAILER if you haven&#39;t read the book. THE TRAILER SPOILS EVERYTHING. <br>I REPEAT. EVERY FUCKING THING!!!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaIs it...unwholesome that Dan Brown&#39;s name in the phone book is...Brown Dan?? it&#39;s just...awkward.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaoooo this book was good
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaomar sy !!!!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitawipe the entire world if you must .
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWoah Omar Sy
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaUhh, I read the book so, no thanks. The book was way better. I hate that interrogator&#39;s accent too.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOmg i just finished the book
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaam looking forward already...my best author and best actor...no combination better
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty awesome
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the actress from the movie Northanger Abbey (the Jane Austen book)!! Didn&#39;t know she every did anything else. Cool!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing everything relevant from this movie. Saves me the 9€ at the cinema.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaLol when the dude said Professor Langton....uh yea gotta see it but I had to stop it bc I know they are gonna show basically the whole movie Lol usually idc for spoilers but this yea I care
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaFictional yes, but heaven and hell are real. One is for those who are saved and the other for those who reject God!<br>There is no in between to pray your way out!  Once you&#39;re there, that is where you will spend eternity! It matters little if you believe it or not, God cannot nor will He lie! about either!!  He leaves it for you to decide... most will do nothing and lose their lives to hell, never getting saved!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaYAAAAAASSS YAAAAASSS I&#39;M SOOOO HAPPYYYY RIGHT NOWW<br><br>YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaDO THEY EVEN REVIEW THEIR OWN TRAILERS BEFORE POSTING OMG I KNOW THE WHOLE MOVIE
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThey could of at least filmed the scene &quot;I will do whatever I can to find it...&quot; Specifically For this trailer instead of just cutting it from the movie cause that sounded really amateurus. You could tell it was taken from the middle of a sentence.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWay to ruin the movie and give away the whole dang plot push gez
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaso the woman with a white band around her who was seen shooting at all the other scenes end up dying by falling from the roof? such a great trailer.....
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks almost like a parody of the first two movies.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWell, at least I won&#39;t have to pay to watch the movie in theatres. I can just watch the trailer right here!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaNote to trailer producers: plot details and spoilers are not necessary for a good trailer. PLEASE get better at this.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitathanks, now I don&#39;t have to watch the movie because you basically just showed me all of it, he either save the world or he doesn&#39;t
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSony&#39;s way too generous. Showing the whole movie they spent millions of dollars on in under 3 minutes takes some heart... and lack of a mind.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitathanks for showing the whole movie in 2 and a half minutes :?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaIstanbul ♥
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaDante&#39;s Infernos a prophecy?! Lol, has Dan Brown even read the inferno?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaYIKES!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a great ad for &quot;why we need Indiana Jones back&quot;.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThey don&#39;t even read the books to at least make it similar
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI want a second game, NOT a movie that doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with the game, but seriously, &quot;Dante&#39;s Inferno&quot; come on Sony
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaA great book! Movie looks good!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI guess the guy at the beginning forgot how to do a Leap of Faith. Or maybe he just missed the haystack.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWhen will Hollywood learn to just STOP MAKING DAN BROWN MOVIES?! Jesus, you know it takes a whole lot of research and a lot of good story telling to for Dan Brown to write a book. It isn&#39;t easy for Hollywood or anyone else to really capture that on film. Jesus, for the sanity of us fans, stop making these films.<br><br>Also, for guys complaining that they spoilt the whole movie, trust me, and trust Dan Brown fans when we say, you have no f***ing clue for much more there is. Stop whining and bitching
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitatoo much information i had to stop watching
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler: He stops it.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSo this is the next assassin&#39;s Creed huh
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSo this is the next assassin&#39;s Creed huh
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaAt first I thought they need the map to go to hell, but it a virus. Still good movie to watch😊.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThis is like another interception or something...
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThat leap of faith <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH2BD49sEZI&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a>
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOK so something about hell and Dante&#39;s mask. Then the search for a virus to save the population? The end.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaCant wait!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI am so going to watch this. Can&#39;t wait!!!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThank God we finally have Opie to explain Dante&#39;s Inferno to us.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThis is an inferno, isn&#39;t it? I infern.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOH HELL YES!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaAww, come on! This wasn&#39;t filmed in 2.4:1 ratio, like the other films? Or is the 1.85:1 just for the trailer somehow?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaso did the Lost Symbol already come out or was this written before angels and demons?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaCool, so basically now I don&#39;t have to see the movie. Thanks Sony! Cheers!🍻
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaYeah, I love this series!!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitafortunately i  read the book but jesus that was heavy on the plot details. way to go marketing.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWtf I read the book and this trailer spoils so much. Still looking forward to it
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI wish they had the same female lead in all 3 films. Constantly changing them is annoying, even if it&#39;s what happened in the books.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is either going to be really good and fun, or way too convoluted.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSpoils whole movie in trailer
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOk I know it&#39;s a book adaptation, but they gave away the whole movie in this trailer! It&#39;s just à warning for others, I wasn&#39;t going to see it anyway.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitahaving read the book, im looking forward to this movie
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitammm i think they&#39;re taking a diffrent path from the book...
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOh my... I completely forgot Felicity Jones was in this movie...
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaDont show the Whole movie in the trailer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now im not gona watch it
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m convinced they let random idiots cut together these trailers. When will you people learn not to show important plot points in the trailers!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThe beginning looked more like Assassin&#39;s Creed II to me. They even had the leap of faith!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is sequel of da vinci code ??
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaNeat evil drone.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a good whole movie.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaJUST WOW <br>Can&#39;t wait !!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSO MANY SPOILERS! When will you learn?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitafirst
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI hope they keep the original ending! It would make the movie worth watching.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS FUCKING EPIC!!!!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI can already picture an Honest Trailer for this one. Maybe it did reveal a lot. Maybe it didn&#39;t. It is all up to a &#39;maybe&#39; now.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaSpoilers, spoilers everywhere... What are the studios thinking these days???
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaPero luce tan genial!... no puedo esperar más!
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaDante.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshita&quot;There was a paacket in his pocket&quot;. Love Omar Sy&#39;s voice.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWhy are trailers nowadays so revealing? This trailer showed far too much of the movie.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWho knows... Maybe a good culling will be good for the planet. :)
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaOMG! I&#39;m so excited!!!❤️❤️😂🙌🏼👌🏻
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaLooks so SO bad.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaKinda revealed too much there, don&#39;t yah think?
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitawhy i have the feeling , he is definitely gonna save the world; too revealing trailer.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitai really hope it follows the book thoroughly because the book&#39;s plot is really riveting.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaExpected Angel to fly at the beginning of the trailer. Was disappointed.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaFelt like I have watched the whole movie
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaWho else think Tom Hanks should win his third academy award in 2016?  , he is a living legend.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitawow this looks like the best one In the Tom hanks Robert langdom series
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaif this plague is real use it ...i think humanity deserves it for all the things happening today while the smart ones hide in the bunkers till it dissapates
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaIt would have been better if they haven&#39;t disclosed the reason behind all the chasing which was the population. Then it would have been better for those who haven&#39;t read the book.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitasony when you want to do good movies you do very good. . but lately you do so bad movies. like ghostbuster.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m worry someday Tom Hanks quit acting and no one is going to be Robert Langdon.
RH2BD49sEZIdelimeterByIshitaloqman
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaNo more sissy Vampires PLEASE! Hunger Games wins, i hope this series gets big because if you&#39;d read the books, you&#39;d know Suzanne Collins deserves it way more than Twilight! God i&#39;m so excited for this movie thought!!!!!!!!! it looks amazing
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaPLEASE!!! DONT START GOING &quot;team peeta!&quot; or &quot;team gale!&quot; this isnt twilight...PLEASE DONT MAKE IT!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@TheSonicMusicdude i think its after x died, just that in the book (since its from katniss&#39; perspective) you dont see the people greeting her back
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitafinally, something more than just running and shooting an arrow

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@ImmaGrander23 
sorry... i didnt know that ppl have to live by ur rules... and just cuz i say its a team doesnt mean i am turning it into twilight...im also not comparing it ( @Blackstar2331 ) im just saying i like peeta more that gail.. if u ha ve a problem with that then u can talk to some one else bout it cuzhanestly I DONT CARE!... TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA(u cant stop me i hope u know that)TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA TEAM PEETA... :)
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@kiko10132007 Jesus christ. This book is genius.... there are THREE of them. I bet you didn&#39;t know that did you? It&#39;s about society and problems within society. TWILIGHT is about a stupid girl who gives her life away for some stupid VAMPIRE boy.

Jesus christ you little twilight lover you...xP
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@HardBassDropHD Lol saying &quot;noobs&quot; is just weird :) and why bring up 13? Don&#39;t ruin it for everyone else!!:D
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@HESin1D Neither can I ahhh:( 
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita1) How could you compare this to twilight? (which has vampires and what not)
2) how could you compare this to Harry Potter? (Which has wizards and what not)
3) IT&#39;S SCIENCE FICTION NOT FANTASY GOD
People can be soooooo stupid!

Comparing the three books is like comparing apples to oranges.
Seriously. 


mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@TheSonicMusicdude  how is that possible? they haven&#39;t even made it yet

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI was gonna be an extra lol... I CAN&#39;T WAIT TO WATCH THIS!!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitano MADGE how could they do that?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitais 1:48 hymic(i for got how to spell his name) he does nnot look like what i imagined
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s a thought, but since this movie and book series is directed at young adults, can the people posting comments on here actually act they have a little bit of human decency and civility by WATCHING YOUR LANGUAGE!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI have goosebumps. Im SO excited! 
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita2:13 it&#39;s so touching  
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaOoooh shitttttt this movies iz gonna b BADASS! 
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitai can already foretell that this movie is gonna suck
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaNow I need to read the book again!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaWhile some parts are inaccurate, the changes made certainly do make the movie a bit more exciting. 
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t really like how district 12 looks
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait to watch to movie! i extremely am a big fan of the series, when i started reading the first book i was so hooked that stayed up into morning reading and reading it! literally! :D
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI think I broke the replay button ^.^

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI knew the trailer would be outstanding, i felt the intensity just like in the book series! Now Let The Games Begin!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaAMAZING! There were a few little things wrong, but I can get over it! I mean did you see Josh! AHH! I can&#39;t wait! Yay!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the music from trailer? starting at 1:20 ???? Please
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitawhoah, this is surprisingly accurate... maybe the movie will be as good as the book
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@iiRoolz well it is in the future. its a post-apocalyptic setting.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaSHUT UP!!!!!!i cant WAIT!!!!!! o my gosh this is gonna be AMAZING. im just as excited for this as the harry potter movies!!!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaOMGOSH I LOVE IT!!!!!! I saw Breaking Dawn Part 1 at midnight last night and they showed the Hunger Games trailer!!! My friends and I﻿ screamed our heads off (we were the only ones in the theatre to get excited about the Hunger Games trailer. It&#39;s like no one else knew what movie preview was being shown and everyone just sat there, silent.) and we all got strange looks by people in the theatre. Peeta&#39;s sooo gorgeous!! Thumbs up if you agree that this is going to be the most epic movie EVER!!! XD
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaomigosh i cant wait till the movie, i hope they do all the books tho

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@dramaqueen7198 me too!! none of my friends even read tho so i&#39;m like the only one excited about this lol

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@dramaqueen7198 from what i heard she&#39;s not! idk why tho bc it would be a short and simple but pivotal role for the movie without altering the storyline...
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!!!! ♥ so excited
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitakimchew12 shut up

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI CANT WAIT!!!!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaSPEECHLESS
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@Butttercup22 MADGE ISNT GOING TO BE PART OF THE FILM?!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaWait was Effie BLONDE?
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaSo. Freaking. Excited. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Feel like screaming now, I really do. I just can&#39;t wait. I love these books so much!! 
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaEpic!

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI actually got the shivers watching this.... can&#39;t wait!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitabut i&#39;m glad they actually made it realistic feeling instead of the eragon fail

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitawait wait wait is flavius, octavia, and vennia or however to spell their names not going to be in it either? and so i guess prim gives her the pin since the mayors daughter isnt gonna be part of the film either?
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@melissasalasdevinney Nothing says idiot like someone who reads a comment wrong. I said it&#39;s more modern than ~I imagined. My mind did not configure most of this.

I&#39;ve read all three books fyi.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaexactly how i pictured it!

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaBallin!!! Totally with the book and definitely not a lame, cheap quality unlike other movies! Can&#39;t wait!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaGreat! Except for the X-Files theme playing at the end...
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI have chills right now.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaomg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg. SPEECHLESS.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@forgottenglimmerI saw a picture of it a while back when they were still filming the movie.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@MayhemKan Actually, Katniss is barely starving because she together with Gale gets extra food on their hunt.. :)
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@popshufruitchu I heard it had been pushed back until May. Praying that&#39;s not true.

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@manga4ever421 Its been March 23 since September...
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitai swear the trailer has atleast 3mil views :O
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaWait, it said March 23, did they change the date again? Or did they just forget to change it to May?

mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitai&#39;m going. i&#39;m expecting alot from this movie. the books were amazing and i can&#39;t wait!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaok. Is it me or does Katniss seem a little old and a little well fed to be a starving teen?
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaThey better not make this movie gay like Twilight.  I want to see as much gore in this as there was in the book!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshita@iiRoolz Yah, people kinda forget that this is a post apocalyptic scenario given the raw action. But regardless of the 11 district&#39;s constant beat down, the capitol evolved, aye? :D
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaNo words to describe how excited I am.  There HAD BETTER be a midnight release for this movie.  I&#39;d wait in line for hours.  Not even kidding.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI thought i was gonna die watching it!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS I CANT STOP WATCHING IT!! 2 girls from my school are in this1!! at 1:04 one is waering a poka doted dress the other one has curly hair she is right in frount of the onther girl on the left side
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS I CANT STOP WATCHING IT!!
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaGOOSEBUMPS. EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaBattle Royale?
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitaA little more modern than I imagined but I&#39;m so going to see this when it comes out.
mfmrPu43DF8delimeterByIshitatoo late... The 3 videos here in youtube already has more than 3MILLION views combined. Lionsgate is always LATE..... Next time make sure that you upload it here first before others... Video views here in youtube are important... and please never try to put down those 3 videos with millions of views!!!!!

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaI accidentally reached this trailer looking for porn.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaI just jizzed myself while watching this.. LITERALLY!!! Can&#39;t wait for it!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshita..?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitathey never seem to get enough
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaFirst I read ERECTIKO. works as well.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshita@ 0:49 &quot;The EVA program was born.&quot;

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitathat would just be fucking silly

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaIMAX!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitarefresh the page over and over and share with all of your friends and family!!!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Neon Genesis Evangelion?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaThe HYPE is strong with this one.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaNo can do. the far bigger chunk we don&#39;t see in here&#39;s probably still going through post-production as we speak...
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshita*Fry squint*
You do know Ron Pearlman has a tv and film career that spans over 30 years, right?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaWow! i got downvoted just for saying Gypsy Danger walking animation on THAT scene isn&#39;t THAT good . . . . Typical!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaRon Pearlman is a badass!! 
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaSo this is a geek&#39;s wet dream dipped in chocolate, deep fried, covered in money and surrounded by titties.   I think I came a couple times during this trailer
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOh yeah cause EVA started it all? LOL
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaI was wondering about the same thing...
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaNo fuckin&#39; way Transformers can compare to this...
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaYo straaang, it&#39;s all in the game yo
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaAnd cue &quot;Cruel Angel Thesis&quot;!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to get high as fuck and watch this.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaPacific Boner
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitafuck yeah.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaSeriously? Ron Pearlman? hahaha. Anybody else from Sons of Anarchy you want to put in this?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaman of steel and ironman 3 will get raped hard by the awesomeness of this movie. 
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaΑν τσεκαρεις google pics USA, Αυστραλια, Iαπωνια, Κινα και Ρωσια εχουν η καθε μια το ρομποτ της στην ταινια. Αντε να βαλουν και κανεναν Ελληνα μεσα με γαλανολευκο ρομποτ να τα σπαει. (σε κανα sequel βεβαια)

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOH SHIT IT&#39;S STRINGER BELL... SHOULD&#39;VE ENDED HIS SPEECH WITH &quot;WELL GET ON WITH IT MOTHERFUCKERS&quot;
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitafuck yeah robots!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOfcourse this isnt going to make as much money because its ORIGINAL. Notice how most blockbusters coming out are all sequels and reboots.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaNow go and return some video tapes.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitado you know what dubstep is? because there is literally no dubstep in this trailer
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaeveryone forgetting  transformers hahahaha

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaWHARRGARBL!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaA kaiju emitting an EMP? HOLY FUCKING SHIT.

I would rob a bank just too see this movie.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaIf only Tony Stark didn&#39;t waste his time building them 47 suits and just made Gipsy Danger. =]
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaCHARLIE! 
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaFUCKING EPIC!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaI have the hugest man-crush on Idris Elba&#39;s characters. He has such charisma :)
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaThis will be BIG...literally!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaWhen I see this I&#39;m gonna need to bring 4 or 5 pairs of pants to the theater
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshita2:05 : Optimus prime called, he wants his dick back !
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaGREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT !!!!! NOW IN GREEK: EXERETIKO EXERETIKO EXERETIKO EXERETIKO EXERETIKO !!!!!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshita1:01 looks like a cartoon . . .
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been a kaiju fan for a very long time, and I am very happy that this movie, and the new Godzilla movie are being made, this generation shall remember, the kaiju!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaWelcome, gentlemen, to the thrilling Hype train. Lock your seabelts and please, enjoy the voyage.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOMAAAGGAAAWWDDDD!!! BWAHHHHH!!! CAN&#39;T WAIITTTT!!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaFrankly, preposterous.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaThat crimson Mech looks siiiiiiiiiick!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaHow awesome that this new trailer is posted as I have Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster playing on the TV in my office.....I am soooo ready for this film!!!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOh they will... Oh they will....
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaYep. I have the soundtrack already. I hope they can finally give justice to Superman and a future for DC cinematic universe
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaCan you actually speak English?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitathis is huge than transformers, epic than lord of the ring, legendary than iron man...

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaBig monsters versus big robots piloted by big girls with big boobs.
I think that&#39;s enough for me.

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaThey are not competing. But Pacific Rim would kill Iron Man 3. Man of Steel will obliterate Iron man 3.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MYD GOD! MASSIVE!
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaU ca try a recently released trailer for a small movie called Man of Steel.
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaBig robots &amp; big monsters fight each other on the ground of biggest cities in the world, what more can u ask for?
5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaAll the excite.

5guMumPFBagdelimeterByIshitaYup.

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaHey ya all Jesus loves you! I hope that makes your day better, have a great one!
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThe car scene is repeted in vampires suck
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m back in 2020😎
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaEdward: say it say it out loud<br>me: what the FLIP I THOUGHT U LOVED HER Y U PRESSERING HER TO SAY SOMETHING!!!
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaVampire diaries is betterrdr
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshita2020 quien la ve en la cuarentena
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this movie so many times but I just now realized that when Edward drove James onto the hardwood floor in the dance studio, all the broken wood pieces are just stakes. He could have just jammed a stake into his heart like a real vampire.
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s here in 2020? Why did we watch it anyway?
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaI’d sell my left kidney on the black market if I could look just like her
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who doesn’t remember the trailer but remembers the movies? It feels so weird to watch the trailer
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitai read the book and i read 20 pages i just started
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaI find these films a guilty pleasure. I know the author intended the story to have a focus on the romance but could of been better if the romance was toned down to a more reasonable level and no sparkles. There are better ways to have them be in the sun and not die and still have a reason to avoid the sun light.
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThis is the whole film on 2 mins wtf
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaich hoffe der film wird gut
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaCame here because I’m rewatching the movie and this trailer is giving me so much nostalgic feels
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaha gay!

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitawhy do we have to watch this shit?
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitameh. the book is better.
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaStill a better love story than 50 shades of gay. :)

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was great but i still think the book is better
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThis is the rfemake of Jackie Chan Movie The Twin Effect
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaStill better than „After”
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDRLSqm_WVg&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a><br>vampire? i think not.<br><br><br><b>HE HAS A F*UCKING REFLECTION!!!!!!!!</b>
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaA trailer that shows the same whole film

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Pyar Ki Ye Ek kahani serial....
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaKristen Stewart, Emma Watson I can’t tell the difference
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThis series is 🤢🤮

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaBEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!! this is my absolute favourite movie of all time! this movie helped me realize that if you love someone, just GO FOR IT! My favourite part of the movie was all of the emotion showed by Kirsten Stewart i just love the way her expression varies so much throughout the movie. Another thing i love is that the trailer makes you want to watch the movie without spoiling any of the events.<br><br><br>all in all twilight has changed my soul, my heart and the way i live my life, give me i like if you agree
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaStill better lovestory than Kachacko

QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaI love this series ❤️❤️❤️
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaJustin oiler <br><br>Jessica messay
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer made the movie look worse than it was. I wish the rest of the movies had maintained Edwards hairstyle so rob’s ageing wouldn’t be so noticeable.
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshita~Justin oiler with Jessica messay~
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshita?
QDRLSqm_WVgdelimeterByIshitaWhere are all the comments lol
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitathis is pretty much a bf4 locker tdm
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaReminded me of the Pineapple Express farmhouse shootout.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis is &quot;F*** Movie&quot;  [ many &quot;F(s)&quot; in the movie ]
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI was sold before the trailer reached 60 seconds, then it gave away a little too much. Still would love to watch it.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaIf Smokin` Aces and The Nice Guys had a baby......frickin` awesome!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBen Wheatly&#39;s American debut looks good.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaConsidering the last movie I saw was Florence Foster Jenkins and I LOVED it...on paper this would not be my kind of movie.  But it looks great.  Can&#39;t wait to go see it.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaCillian Murphy!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Armie Hammer doing among all those talented actors? How did he con his way into this job? Oh right, privilege.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitalooks like a great fun. I&#39;ll check it out
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitalooks great
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitayeah, fuck that black actor in the trailer! he doesn&#39;t deserve a name credit!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a mix between &#39;&#39;Reservoir Dogs&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Nice Guys&#39;&#39;,awesome.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaRed band trailer my ass, all I see is a bunch of cowgirls but not cowboys is just shooting each others stinkhole assole and that annoying women scream just made my ear bleed Jesus
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThe whole film is a shoot out in a factory?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaMonsters.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing the whole movie guys! I&#39;ll now wait for its DVD release.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Tarantino movie
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI like these weird ass movies with Sharlto Copley.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitasince this is a Martin Scorsese thing how much you Wanna bet that they&#39;re gonna play gimmie Shelter
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaAlternative ending to Reservoir Dogs?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah, Cillian Murphy!!!<br><br>And I want to like Brie Larson, but I&#39;m just not sold yet. Maybe something about her face
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me the hatefull 8
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaOmg I&#39;ve never seen Cillian Murphy in a role like this I am SOLD!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaMade me think of the end twist with it all being just a paint-ball game that&#39;s in the perspective of the characters playing the game.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaAfter that Dog shit 21 Jump street movie I will never watch a another movie with Brie Larson.....FUCK OFF!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaCillian Murphy AND Sharlto Copley. This is going to be fantastic.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThe non-red band trailer would be like 3 seconds long.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis is what I call a All-star ensemble .
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitait looks like a Guy Richey movie trying to be a Tarantino movie.. I didn&#39;t like the trailer, but they brought a lot of talent so I&#39;ll hope for the best with this one
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitatoo much shown. now I won&#39;t go and see it. they did the same with deadpool and civil war. Hollywood ain&#39;t got a clue
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaanything with Cillian Murphy is usually good
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitasharlto Copley is at it again!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaStupidest.  Thing.  I.  Have.  Ever.   Seen.<br>And I saw &quot;Ice Pirates&quot; !
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaWell shit. This looks kinda awesome! 😂😂
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBen Wheatley is the MAN!!  Looks AWESOME!!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitawhoah just like The Nice Guys, love it!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s mad that 3 of the main cast are paddy&#39;s
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBallroom Blitz would go great with this trailer.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaOlive garden
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitais it me or Jack Reynor looks like if Chris Pratt and Seth Rogen had a baby ?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the most ORIGINAL movie&#39;s this year!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaSong please))
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshita
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaReservoir Dogs meets The Depahted
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBrie Larson can do anything!!!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitashut the fuck up and take my fucking money.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this movie today at TIFF. You should go see it when it comes out. It was a hell of a lot of fun!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis cast is already delicious but the cherry on top of this trailer and what sold me to go see this is the line &quot;I forgot who&#39;s side I&#39;m on!&quot; Brilliant!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaIs that one gun deal gone wrong the whole movie?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaHow fucking dare you not mention sam riley
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaSo this is what Wikus vandeMerwe spent his time doing after Christopher turned him back
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI love it
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitayou couldnt pay me
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s all the movie?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me more of Martin McDonaugh&#39;s two films more than Tarantino. The humor is a little drier and more British
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks funny as fuck...
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaPues ya hemos visto la peli entera.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI fucking need this...oh so much.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThey resumed the movie in 160 seconds pretty well.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks stylish and has a great cast, but is this entire film spent in a warehouse?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaReservoir Dog mixed with the Nice Guys.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaare they gonna shoot at each other for the whole 2 hours
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaReservoir Dogs for the ADHD generation
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitai hereby claim this warehouse, by ORDER OF THE PEAKY BLINDERS!!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve heard about this movie, I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel like a Tarentino movie. Now I&#39;m really curious.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaCritics dig this kind of film. I predict over 90% RT ratings.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like something made by Quentin Tarantino
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty funny but damn does the entire movie take place at that one Gun Meet?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, but no need to see the movie now.. christ movie trailers are fucking terrible these days
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaDid they just give away the entire third act of the film??
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitawho else thought cilian murphy and emily blunt were siblings?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaWould this be the the curse of the Oscars for Brie Larson? <br>This movie looks kind of boring...
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBanters times. Banters measures...
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThat might be the stupidest thing I&#39;ve seen in a long time
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaIs Cillian Murphy doing a funny role? Can&#39;t wait to see the movie! Hope it will release in Hong Kong.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBen Wheatley should stop making movies.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLove Ben Wheatley, this looks good, but fuck me is this trailer boring as shit. Whoever edited this needs to stick to feature-editing.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaSaw this last night at the TIFF world premiere - it&#39;s incredible. Movie of the year so far in my opinion.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaNo time to Mention Sam Riley, Shame on you Makers
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBen Wheatley is a genius. I can&#39;t wait to see this.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a lot of fun. Can&#39;t wait to see Brie Larson kick ass.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaFinally this is online. I saw this trailer with Swiss Army Man.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThat looks like a lot of fun.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaBack to room?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitabasically arena shooter: the movie?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaA24 cannot seem to screw up
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks fucking awesome and I&#39;m the biggest Brie Larson fan in the world so I&#39;m in I hope it&#39;s an Oscar material and pf course for Brie
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshita70s gun movies have been very prominent lately...
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing ;)
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaLOOKS. FUCKING. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Brie Larson is my favorite actor, and this is the trailer that we NEEDED ALL YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!! My most anticipated film of 2017!!!!!!!!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaRelease date: March 31st, 2017........oh great.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaHands up if you liked High-Rise!
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitathis looks so fucking good...but so did the suicide squad trailer. I hope it turns out to be an awesome movie
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI knew Jack Reynor had talent. I called him a more serious Seth Rogen.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like so much fun, I really hope it plays near me so I can give A24 more of my money.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaI wasn`t expecting it to be so funny.This looks hilarious.I`m in.
oDD3I0uOlqYdelimeterByIshitaCillian Murphy&#39;s accent is something else 😂
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThe best Bond
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCasino Royale in Monte Negro aka Casino de Monte Carlo in Monte Carlo, Monaco, the real inspiration for the book and the movie.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI got to admit after seeing this, Daniel Craig did a very good job in this one.  But the rest not so good.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitabest bond evar
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCasino Royale was best
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaQue hermoso que sos Daniel !!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita10 years ago
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaAhh that trailer is horrible but it was made 10 years ago soo... yeah
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is amazing, just like the movie itself. I loved Daniel Craig as Bond, but it&#39;s really sad that he has quitted the franchise.<br>EDIT: He&#39;s back for one more Bond movie!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitacooool
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita10 years ago!!! I remember when this first came out people are underestimate him as James Bond because he&#39;s blonde and too bulky!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaGood trailer, but it suffers from &quot;revealing way too much about the movie&quot;.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBest Bond movie!<br>1° Cassino Royale 2° GoldenEye  3°Goldfinger
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaWatched this when I was 8 , i dont remember shit.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitamy favourite
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaFor me Tom Cruise is the best Bond of all time.uh... wait...
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitalike
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitai love the blonde james bond.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe 10 years have passed...
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita71070
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaEsta nueva entrega de la franquicia de James Bond 007 es una renovación completa. Siempre pensaba que Pierce Brosnan seria insuperable; pero Daniel Craig ha sido estupendo en el atuendo de 007.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaIl mio film di 007 preferito...tanta roba
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie make me a Bond&#39;s fan. I absolutetly love it
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaseems like Casino Royale and Skyfall were the only masterpieces
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaPlease bring Brosnan here !!! Craig it&#39;s not so good
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t decide if this was better than Skyfall. Skyfall was amazing
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI find it stupid when people judge an actor for not fitting in as Bond&#39;s character because of his hair, blue eyes and height. I mean seriously, what the fuck? DONT JUDGE THE BOOK BY ITS COVER.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBest 007 movie  EVER . Bottom line
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was definitely the best
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaDaniel&#39;s eyes make him look supernatural.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever and this is one of his best!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBEST BOND EVER
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaNope!  Too much violence.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s got to be hard to be in that kind of condition at his age....He&#39;s got to be in his mid 50s!!<br>...Assuming that was really his  body.....[on the beach].
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita007: From the Bahamas with Coconuts;)
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaWoo next James Bond 007 specter movieee
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaDamn good trailer for a damn good movie.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThe only question remains, will you heal.... in time? 
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBEST ---- BOND ---- MOVIE ---- EVER.     Skyfall: a Bond movie for the sheeple and clapping seals of society.   Casino Royale: a man&#39;s Bond movie.   This movie is excellence, if not epic, in film-making on every account:  Intelligent dialogue, witty banter, charm in it&#39;s exotic locations and character development, dynamic script, dynamic locations, dynamic sub-action phases and plot, amazing action scenes that are one-of-a-kind in many regards.   Nevermind that it&#39;s a part of the admittedly often cheesy but love-of-nostalgia Bond franchise; Casino Royal is a stand-alone GREAT movie in itself.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBest Bond Movie Ever
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best Bond film out of every single one.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaGreatest Bond Period,with Craig as Bond!!!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaIf you pay attention, you&#39;ll realize that the dialogue in this trailer, starting from &quot;You have your armor back on&quot;, really describe the character growth Bond would go through in the later years. Vesper has stripped Bond&#39;s armor, thus making him distance from a proper relationship in Connery&#39;s years and beyond (minus the few Bond movies like Lazenby). And then you have Le Chiffre asking, &quot;Will you heal... in time?&quot; I felt like this was to set up to make us question, &quot;Did Bond ever heal in those previous movies, if this is a prequel to&#39;em all?&quot;
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI love Eva Green, she&#39;s an awesome actress !
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s a  fact  I read about Tarantino . Back in 04&#39; He rallied to the producers to direct this film  , but have Brosnan play the part and it would had stuck to the Fleming book and be in the 60&#39;s  , but He wanted full control of the film an was trying to get the rights , but Eon wouldn&#39;t  go for it . He really wanted to do this film bad , that He never watched this film . Campbell also said He will never direct another 007 film again , though Nolan maybe the next Guy in line . Who knows ?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBest bond.... ever
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is so good for 2006
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitawow 2006 Best bond i think
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaMe
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaPlenty of action; more plot twists than anticipated.  James captivates us -- making international intrigue a perplexing mixture of temptation &amp; revulsion.  As time goes on -- the tools of the trade get more advanced ................ but the same bloody conflicts endure.  Love it anyway!  * Cav ~ Intl. traveler since 1959!  4/13/15.  *
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best Craig Bond film to date . Mendes is making Bond too much as a soap opera story where this has action  ,more action and a good story.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI still remember the moment when I saw this in the cinema in 2006. Best Bond movies in years right there.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know where I can get this exact song, its not the original track that we all know and love but I&#39;ve have searching for this track and shazam hasn&#39;t been successful for me, any ideas to who composed it would be helpful but as described this is a different version than the original so it makes it difficult to find also its not in the Casino Royale soundtrack, which was one of the places I checked in itunes hoping to be successful
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaBond is G..
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitache fascino
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCasino Royal on of the best movies in Bond franchise - admit it!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, I never expected much of this movie, even by looking at this trailer it doesn&#39;t make me expect much, good thing because when I actually watched it it fucking blew my mind, fucking AMAZING movie, well worth the 95% at Rotten Tomatoes
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCasino Royale &amp; Skyfall &gt;&gt; Quantum of Solace
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaDansk skuespiller.!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCheck out this sweet drawing of Daniel Craig. All bond fans will like this one!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZQ4tKgZXN8">Brandon Draws! - Daniel Craig</a>
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI noticed they edited out the part where the &quot;007&quot; logo turns into &quot;NOV 17th&quot;
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaskyfall was too slow and boring , cadino royale is best
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaIdiots... I live in Montenegro.. it is not filmed in Montenegro.. It is filmed in Czesh Republic...
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita2 thumbs up!!!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite bond movie but i have to say that Pierce Brosnan is my favorite james bond of all time
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitakosherit
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI saw sky fall in the cinema and I found casino royals in my local library for 50 cents!! Hope it works!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaHere is another trailer as well, pretty good, pretty dark; ?v=vGcAulreZGQ
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaHave not seen it yet but will on Monday
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSkyfall is better, because it&#39;s like a blend of the new and old bond..
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaLove all the James Bond Movies there great &lt;3
but i Love the Daniel Craig ones the best :)
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaOMG RLY?!

I didn&#39;t know that..

*SARCASM SPHERE SELF TEST COMPLETE*
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is deceiving because the music in the movie was not at all the normal Bond score. Still a great action movie though!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSo the woman dies?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaGOOD FRIGGING PREVIEW! AFTER I SAW THE DOCUMENTARY, I&quot;M SPECIALLY INTRIGUED BY THIS J. BOND EPISODE!! SAW IT, LOVED IT!!!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitacasino Royal is in terms of action not as good as Skyfall however the fact that that Bond has a REAL relationship that is so different, that he actually falls for someone. That is what makes this film amazing, and on a par with Skyfall, if not better than it.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaAfter the end of the world.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaWhen does it come out!?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI think half of the dialogue in this trailer wasn&#39;t even included in the movie.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaHahahahaha youre funny,, you should be a comedian
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitanot in my opinion
it seems Casino Royale=Dark knight
              Skyfall=Batman Begins
              Quantum of Solace=Dark knight rises
for my opinion

36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaGood lord this came out 6 years ago!!!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThat comment was posted 3 months ago. And no, I still haven&#39;t seen it, but I will asap.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThe audio in this seems slightly different than the other CR trailers on YouTube.  Is it just me?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSkyfall had a good story and everything, I just wish the action was on the level of Casino Royale. Casino Royale was more &quot;thrilling&quot;.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSkyfall has unseated Casino Royale as the best Bond film ever, but Royale is still brilliant. 
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita1:31 there is something about watching that building just sink that puts chills down my spine!
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaA poker scene in Casino Royale is more thrilling than the whole Skyfall.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI concur.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshita-I would be keeping my eye on the government money, and off your perfectly formed ass.
-You noticed?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSkyfall --&gt; Casino Royale --&gt; Quantum of solace
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaSkyfall goes deeply into more who Bond is, his past, and his weaknessess, and Royale is by far the best typical badass Bond movie ever to be made.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaWell that&#39;s for you to decide....
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it and have my own impression. So it&#39;s negatively different?
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaI HAVE, and I have to say, Royale is still better. Skyfall is....different
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaOf course I haven&#39;t, it premieres on 26th in my country.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitathan you havent seen skyfall yet
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaIt maybe have q real James bond in 2013. I will discovered him within march of 2013.
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitai watched the whole movie in this trailer
36mnx8dBbGEdelimeterByIshitaThis is by far my favourite Bond movie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaHonestly I couldn&#39;t stop crying of this movie!! Very emotional
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI just saw it on Netflix. It was so good. The ending was happy/ sad :(
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant film, left me kind of speechless. It&#39;s an emotional film, with the right outcome thank god.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI see the man Ryan was playing. He was  totally the excellent performer!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI actually enjoyed the film. The l performances of the two lead actors were great.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI actually enjoyed the film. The l performances of the two lead actors were great.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitagreat movie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaTatiana &lt;3
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitathis seems like it might be decent movie ... but it seems like every movie that comes out these days is trying to paint jews in a good light im starting to believe all the  conspiracy theorists
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie two thumbs up.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI went to the Neue Gallery in New York to see it, and the painting is incredible. Beyond stunning.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaPlease, can you hep me with the music title in the end of the trailer from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9JeTX6Sdw&amp;t=0m40s">0:40</a> to the end?
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAfter seeing debates on Facebook about the veracity of the holocaust.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many were Jews, how many were gypsies, how many were Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. What does matter is that one family had their lives destroyed but survived with hope and determination making new lives.  And finally winning back what was theirs from the start.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaTurns out...Deadpool is better lawyer than Matt Murdock. Pool helped Helen Mirren get her painting back!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI went to see &#39;Woman in Gold&#39; at my local library... This is a &quot;must see&quot; film... Don&#39;t miss it!.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitai am from austria and i am living in Vienna
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the soundtrack in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9JeTX6Sdw&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> ?<br>i need it
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie recently and never expected it would be of much interest as its not really my kind of film. However, it is actually a decent movie!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe Helen Mirren was nominated for a sag award for this, it wasn&#39;t a bad performance, but it wasn&#39;t award&#39;s worthy either.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThis is a movie about that painting on the cup you got Jan
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaincredible!!!! really its a very nice movie
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitain my cinema literally only old people watched it apart from 15 year old me
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitatatiana maslany bae 😍
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaGot chills while watching this, probably gonna watch it rn
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitagreat movie !
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI watched the movie it was a lot of crying and I think what happened to Austrian jewish population is really bad but in the other hand there mother country is doing worst to the Palestinians not for 5 years but for 60 years or more if what happened to your population in Austria is bad do not be hypocrites and let your mother country doing worst to the Palestinian ??????????????????
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThe song from <a href="http://youtu.be/wu9JeTX6Sdw?t=0m42s">0:42</a> please!!!!!!!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThe US, like it helped Maria Altmann, should it now help Cubans get back their respective “Woman in Gold”? <br><br><a href="http://perkurowski.blogspot.com/2015/07/can-cubans-get-back-what-was-stolen.html">http://perkurowski.blogspot.com/2015/07/can-cubans-get-back-what-was-stolen.html</a>
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie! Don&#39;t mind butt hurt Nazi saying shit
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAntigerman and antiaustrian... as usual in Wollyhood :(
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the movie.... just... wow...
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely watching this, because TATIANA MASLANY (who really does look like young Helen Mirren!)
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaA wonderful movie portraying the seek for justice and closure. With her successful endeavour she felt as if, after all those years, she struck back against those who tore her life apart in Austria. She faced her ghosts and finally closed one of the most heavy chapters of her life. The painting was hers, therefore justice had to be made. Once with the painting, it was wonderful to know that after she sold it, most money were donated to the Maria Altmann Family Foundation, Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust and other philantropic institutions. Wonderful story to be quite honest. :)
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer that doesn&#39;t show the whole movie :))
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAdele Bloch-Bauer by Gustav Klimt painting sold for 135M USD -
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaTATIANA MASLANY!!!!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitai just watched this movie...<br><br>i cried...all the tears...
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaSESTRAAAAAAA Maria !!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitarofl ryan reynolds??? no thanks///
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThe Hollywood Propaganda political machine oiled up and running I see lol 
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI dont believe she donated all or the most of the money to charity. She even not paid for the paint. it was of her uncle, not even her father. I think the trial resolution was stupid. And I am not from Austria.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!Love Daniel and Katie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaHere for Tatiana Maslany. 
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gives me goosebumps all over!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaCast:<br>Tatiana Maslany
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAlso Reinolds prooved beeing a terrific actor
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaIt´s been released in Chile, yesterday. For Helen Mirren fans it is a perfect movie to watch. Although it has a lot of sour parts it is a very pretty shoot. <br><br>A wonderful story telling in which the word restitution is the key. People who loose more, wins more. LOVELY
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaHer parents were Russian Jews who changed their names from &quot;Mironoff&#39; to &quot;Mirren.&quot; It&#39;s not surprising that she&#39;d want to be in this movie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitai think what the title said is about the woman in the painting.. that why they called it woman in gold
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this movie bad , does anyone know when it comes out on on Demand ???
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant, absolutely BRILLIANT!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Another Hollywood fantasy.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThe painting is much smaller in reality, it was quite recently sold for an alleged 130 million dollars.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaSHE JUST WANTED THE MONEY!!!<br>From Wikipedia:  &quot;The paintings left Austria in March 2006 and were on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art until June 30, 2006. Months after the Austrian government returned Altmann&#39;s family&#39;s belongings, she consigned the Klimt paintings to auction house Christie&#39;s, to be sold on behalf of her family. The painting Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907) was sold to cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder for $135 million, at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting. Since July 13, 2006, the painting has been on public display in the Neue Galerie in New York City, which was established by Lauder in 2001. The four additional works by Klimt were also exhibited at the Neue Gallerie for several weeks in 2006.[9]<br>In November 2006, Adele Bloch-Bauer II (1912) was sold at auction at Christie&#39;s in New York fetching almost $88 million. In total, the four remaining paintings sold at auction for $192.7 million; coupled with the Lauder-bought painting the sum total was approximately $325 million. The proceeds were divided up among several heirs.&quot;
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaNo!  it&#39;s blue  &amp; black
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitalooks like a great film.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a thoroughly well made film about a gross injustice being put right. I can&#39;t wait to see it. Helen Mirren just gets better and better. If you&#39;ve not seen it, I can also recommend &quot;The Hundred Foot Journey&quot;. Good to see Ryan Reynolds doing something different as well.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaSuch a good story cannot be told too often.  Justice is a good thing.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaif the nazis hadnt made her uncle broke he would have honoured his wifes will and the paintings would be hanging in vienna now, so the paintings are now in private collections no one can see them so in essence have nazis have won?
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThe title is wrong it&#39;s supposed to be The women in BLACK AND BLUE!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know anything about this painting and Gustav Klimt until I bought, while visiting Prague, a plate that had this painting on it. Then I saw the documentary &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot; and learned about Maria Altman and her ten year struggle to successfully regain what was eventually proven to have been taken from her family. (The Austrian government had perpetuated a falsehood, that the painting had been donated by the family) I will definitely be going to see this movie, and when I go visit my sister in NY, I will go see the painting for myself at the Neue Galarie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitagive the lady back her painting and her Jew gold naooow!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaAlso known as the woman in blue and black😂
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI told you the dress is white and gold.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitahelen mirren and ryan reynolds sex scene wot
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitatatiana maslany &lt;3
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaPhilomena 2.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitafirst of all, the whole case wasn&#39;t just about one klimt painting, but five. and after maria altmann got the five paintings, she offered austria to buy them back, for 250 million dollars. will we see this small detail in the movie? hm, my guess is: no. p.s. but it&#39;s nice to see tatiana maslany on the big screen!
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was the Woman in Black?
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitageez can it get more cliche? it must be the 2413453463434234 movie about war + woman + some injustice or stolen painting + an academy award actor + everything else. I&#39;m done. I&#39;ll gonna start to do my own films.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshita… parece ser um filme incrível 
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaFun Fact: Nazis are back in Austria in the form of &quot;Pegida&quot; and a government party called &quot;FPÖ&quot;. So this movie won&#39;t even make it into Cinemas over here.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaTom Schilling &lt;3
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaWhat do you mean the woman in gold? All I see the painting is blue and black :P<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>All jokes aside, I&#39;m intrigued to see this movie, it looks aesthetically beautiful♡
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitajust give them all oscars and call it a day
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m used to seeing Ryan Reynolds as the funny guy, but I quite like this. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing him in more serious roles in future movies...excluding the new Deadpool movie.
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so boring but of course, she&#39;ll get another Oscar nom
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaPainting looks like it was made by Klimt...
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaFor anyone that see black, go google &quot;THE WOMAN IN BLACK movie trailer&quot;
wu9JeTX6SdwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definitely seeing black and blue..

4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaLooks damn good
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI was just discussing this with my friends earlier.<br>one of em said that a new movie will come out and here it is..
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI thought the first one was decent, a solid 3/5, so hopefully this one will at least be decent also
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI want the last 2 minutes of my life back
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitawhere is isla fisher?
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI still didn&#39;t understand the ending of the first one
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t gonna watch this after the first one but Lizzy Caplan.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t gonna watch this after the first one but Lizzy Caplan.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone knows why Isla Fisher is not in this one? It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like Lizzy Caplan, I just loved Henley (Isla&#39;s character). I was just wondering.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaYer a wizurd harri :D
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaSo Mr Potter is a bad guy here. or...
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potter and the 4 Horsemen
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaWtf, there&#39;s so much dialogue out of sync with the characters. Seems very rushed.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaFirst one was ok. But got so much credit (too much imo). Really didn&#39;t have to make a sequel.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaJesse Eisenberg still be recovering from his lex luthor baldness
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one that thinks I saw KSI ? xD
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaThey missed a huge opportunity here. &quot;Now you see me, Now you don&#39;t&quot; should have been the title.

4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaFirst, did anyone ask for a sequel.  2.  The plot is as predictable as it gets.  3. If it wasn&#39;t for the cast this movie would bomb. 4. I&#39;m watching this.

4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will earn more money in 2 days  than I will in my entire lifetime.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Isla Fisher ?
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitadaniel should just whip out his wand and make the horsemen run into helms deep with a torch
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was sub par.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitabest part of the trailer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I8rVcSQbic&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> :3
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaI honestly didn&#39;t like the first one.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaLook Like Watchdog Game :-)
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaThis is the definition of a studio clusterfuck.
4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitaYASS

4I8rVcSQbicdelimeterByIshitasecond
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitabecause american lives are the most important of them all, fuck the others<br>(for the dumb, I&#39;m being sarcastic)
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CJBuUwd0Os&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a> did that dude just clear a room with a m240b. &quot;sees directed by Michael Bay&quot;
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI see Jim and Roy patched things up.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaDo you wanna die for your country? What is a (1st world) country in 2015 but a big ass mall? Do you wanna die for a mall?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWill watch.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who dislikes Michael Bay can go fuck himself no need for hatred here
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaListen I think Michael bay is a great director but in his own very cheesy explosive way but I hope this movie isn&#39;t like his others otherwise it&#39;s gonna ruin the true story 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita.17 looks like the same shot in transformers with the guy with glasses, same explosions and lenseflares...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMy first reaction:<br><br>&quot;God Bless Men Who Stand Up For Integrity.&quot;
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Michael Bay was a republican. Why else would you put out a movie like this months before the election. <br>I hope Murica enjoys President Trump 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaPathetic fluff and excruciating posing
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaGood to see Michael Bay is now free to direct Transformers 5.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitanot bad face intensifies
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s good the avergae American citizen will know what happened about Benghazi more and get a clearer understanding about how Obama and Hillary Clinton left their own people to rot. I hope Michael Bay keeps the movie accurate.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaHillary for prison 2016
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaFuck Hillary for ignoring our boys, and our ambassador! Fuck that bitch!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaFuck Michael Bay up his stupid ass.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing missing is Michael Scott making a cameo appearance and Dwight Schrute appearing from nowhere in warpaint. DWIGHT AND JIM TOGETHER WOULD KICK BUTT.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita&quot;THIS IS A TRUE STORY&quot; <br>Not, &quot;BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS&quot;<br>or, &quot;INSPIRED BY REALITY&quot;<br>So we have to remember, when watching this movie, EVERYTHING WAS REAL. It all happened exactly as will be portrayed in this film. So let us remember- (explodes from sarcasm overload...Michael Bay style)
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaHmmm. this looks interesting<br><b>Directed by Michael Bay</b><br>Goddammit.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaRIP Vile Rat<br>
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaFirst Comment!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaFUUUUCK YEAAAAH! WE&#39;RE TAKIN BACK AMERICA IN 2016!<br><br>Mr. Bay, please. PLEASE, do right by them. And make us all Proud again.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaEnh, looks like a poor mans Black Hawk Down. I saw this as a fan of Bad Boys, Armageddon, and Pain and Gain; Bay has no subtly.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMichael Bay, please stop making movies.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it might be good despite Michael Bay&#39;s name attached to it.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThe Office 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaLOL you have your Transformers explosions.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaOMG I want to see this movie!!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaHillary is shitting her pants hopefully...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaIs this the story where Hillary and Obama did nothing to help and let those Americans die?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitapropaganda on fleek dafuq
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitayou can tell this movie is nothing but american propaganda and oh yeah, Michael Bay as the director? seriously?! and what is with the beard fettish?  all the mian characters look the same! this movie is gonna suck! you would have to be a real kiss ass patriot to like this movie.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaRoy vs Jim.<br>Who will win?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaTuna?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThe only think I could think about throughout the trailer was wow... is that Jim from the office? Then I was waiting for Dwight to jump out of the bushes with his RPG!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita&quot;From Director Michael Bay&quot;<br><b>explosions</b>
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI would like to take Hilary Clinton to see it.Maybe then she can feel responsible for what she did to them.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaToo soon =/
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaOMG JIM AND ROY
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t suck, please don&#39;t suck, please don&#39;t suck....uggghhhh this looks like it&#39;s really going to suck.<br><br>Mr. Bay, if you turn this film (which should be a factual tribute) into a Hollywood action flick, you have no idea how many vets are going to find a way to climb through their television screens and make you choke yourself.<br><br>Mr. Bay, if you are reading this and can relate any frame from this film in ANY way to Transformers, put a hold on the release and go back to the drawing board. Or better yet, hand the reigns over to someone who has the primary objective of honoring those who gave their lives in this Clinton caused tragedy.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t give a fuck if Michael Bay directed this. It looks interesting<br><br>Besides, Pain and Gain along with The Rock were great movies
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaBased of the AD it looks like it is going to be a good move 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWhat a coincidence, this movie comes out right as Queen Hillary prepares to take the White House. This film is dumb patriot propaganda porn at it&#39;s finest. I would pay to see a movie about the 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton deliberately hid and then mass deleted or A film about how Chris Christie and his cronies shut down a bridge endangering peoples public safety. But I&#39;m sure the sheeple will make this a blockbuster!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaTrailer came out three hours ago and it&#39;s already on Ad&#39;s?? Wow 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t care what people say about Michael Bay, this movie looks different from a lot of what he has done before.  I&#39;m looking forward to this one.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaOh, and for anyone talking shit about the movie, already, just because Michael Bay&#39;s name is attached to it can burn in Hell. And I&#39;m dead fucking serious.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaJim &quot;The Action Hero&quot; Halpert. Am I right?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaScreenplay by Fox News.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMichael Bay :)
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great!!!! People always attach such a stigma to Michael&#39;s name. Say what you wanna say, but the man knows how to make the big hits!!!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThere is nothing glorious about honor-less Mercenaries.<br>Just as there is nothing glorious about war...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThe title should&#39;ve been 13 Hours:Without Transformers.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaAw crap. Things were looking ok, until I saw &quot;From Director <b>Michael Bay</b>&quot;. This movie is going to suck, with Bay as director. There already got the explosions, and the &#39;Murica vibe going on, all that&#39;s left are the racist stereotypes. And since the movie is based off a non-fiction novel about the 2012 Benghazi attack, there isn&#39;t going to be any good portrayals of Libyans in this movie, not at all.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to sink the holly <b>**</b> out of Hillary Clintons campaign.. Oooorah!!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks too good! Hillary&#39;s gonna hate it though :)
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be great.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI was so hyped up until <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CJBuUwd0Os&amp;t=1m52s">1:52</a>
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThey got his name wrong- it&#39;s supposed to be MICHAEL BAY!!!!!<br>XD
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis better be good. I have high hopes and there&#39;s only one chance for this story to be told right.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaAt first I was like ah yeah! But then I saw &quot;Michael Bay&quot;..... This is just going to be explosion after explosion...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaUGHHH.....was so hyped....then it said Michael Bay.... the disappointment hit hard
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t want to be mean, but when I saw Michael Bay I groaned...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaTransformers: Without the Trasformers
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaFor a second this looked interesting...until I saw Michael Bay
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaIts like this looks interesting then you see &quot;from director Michael Bay&quot; then its like aww fuck.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaDirected by Michael Bay. nuff said!!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaChuck!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaIf only Rainn Wilson was in this movie...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CJBuUwd0Os&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a> wtf? is that roy? are jim and roy in the same film? haha
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitait looks like transformers without the transformers
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting<br>&quot;From Director Michael Bay&quot;<br>&quot;January 15&quot;<br>AND this movie can go take Satan&#39;s cock in hell for all eternity.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaCan tell just from the camerawork in this trailer that I&#39;ll get the same headache that you get with every Bay film since Bad Boys 2.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaTransformers movie... without Transformers...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWOW! Gale Boetticher is alive! I knew it!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaJust in time for Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2016 election ;)
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaOh crap! This could be good! <br><br><b>remembers first attempt at serious: Pearl Harbor</b><br><br>Aw.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitawheres the guy playing eve when these guys show up
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaAre they going to show Obama and Hillary watched as our ambassador is sodomized by &quot;protestors&quot; (Al qaeda militants) or how our &quot;brave&quot; special forces stood down when they were told to when they were just 30 mins outside of benghazi. Or how about the weapon transfers of stinger missiles to syrian rebels, which was the prime reason for this entire attack in the first place. OOOrrr is this just going to be another ra ra propoganda last stand movie?
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWelcome to 3-4 Months entertainment and political news. This will likely cause a shitstorm from EEEEEVVVEEERRRYYYYY one on any side. <br><br>This gentlepeople, Will like if Ellen Pao, Donald Trump, Catlyn Jenner and Tom Brady all got together to Censor Half life 3
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Pam? Hoping Michael Scott at least makes a cameo appearance.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaTraitors Clinton and Obama won&#39;t like this will they...
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaA movie about Benghazi, Fox News will be please.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaEh :/
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure Mike is gonna find a way to squeeze in a couple upskirts in this one.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMike should stick to public speaking about TV&#39;s he has absolutely no clue about!
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaYikes :/
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaHow many saw Michael Bay and went straight to hit the dislike button? lol
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Based on a true story!  Our evidence........the movie!&quot;
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitao7 Vile Rat.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaAre we gonna get the &#39;Obama cut&#39; with all the truth removed? loolloolol
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMy first reaction: <br><br>&quot;Is that Jim from The Office?&quot;
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaWell, for a Bay movie this looks good. Lets give him a chance.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a load of shit.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaI call the rotten tomatoes score will be 10 to 40% 
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMichael Bay is an auteur of the action movie style, shame he can&#39;t back it up with substance.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaMan the later episodes of The Office got weird.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitathen americans wonder why everyone hates them i mean look at this movie BYE
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaJim and Roy together again.
4CJBuUwd0OsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good movie. Hopefully people give it a chance before hating on it due to Michael Bay&#39;s directing of the film.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThis looks wicked!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitai wanna see this movie! it looks bad ass!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@InTheEnd75 there saying that because its true, a lot of the modern movies show the entire movie in the trailer. the worst one to do this would be armored. there was one movie that showed the twist in the trailer
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaone man vs the world?...could be epic if this movie wasn&#39;t so gay
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathis just looks weird.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaofficially excited.  
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@MacDaddyRiggles lol i was talking about Culkin from home alone, i know nothing about scot pilgrim and i also had no idea there was a series of books on this, so you just told me something new too lol ty

7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita&lt;3 wanna see soo bad. xD
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Erilis666 omg he had a brother?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Cyrunix that&#39;s his brother.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitahmm.... i donno... looks a little dumb... but i loved shaun of the dead.. it just seems like it&#39;s more of kids... ugh, that &quot;no clue --- Gets it&quot; thing was just sooo dumb.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitais that the home alone kid @ 0:30 ?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@im2not2cory Nobody saw Kick Ass because they heard it was a non-stop violent assault on adults by a ten year old girl. 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@im2not2cory i saw it
kick ass was asskick. lmao.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita....I was like AHHHH  why micheal sera of all they couldv&#39;e chose...his movies are aweful...EXCEPT Superbad....man I so hope for a sequel to this awesome movie.!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@bryce8474823944H Dude, whats up with everybidy saying that a trailer shows the whole movie. Thats Bull shit. No one&#39;s perfect
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaJust ..what is micheal sera playing as scott...thats like saying he&#39;d be his voice over...aw man...sooo wrong ..I wasn&#39;t even expecting that damn turnabout....espically a live action so soon...shouldv&#39;e cartooned this shit first..I definitely would like to see some episodes of it....scott pilgrim v.s the world...man hope infinte sadness storyline is in this damn movie.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaah still playing the awkward kid who gets the girl. thats original
ill watch it because the chick is hot, but other than that it looks bad. also it shows the entire movie in the trailer
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathe l word &quot; leasbian?&quot; the other l word &quot; lesbians?&quot; epic
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie to get high to
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitai think the movie will bomb but not becuase its bad. it looks funny and pretty awesome but its going to turn into another Kick-Ass......WHY DID NOONE GO SEE KICK-ASS?!?!?!?!!!? I HATE YOU AMERICAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like Michael Cera (except for Arrested Development), but I might actually check this out. It&#39;s too bad he still has &quot;plank&quot; written all over him. Let&#39;s hope this one isn&#39;t him rehashing his role from Juno, again.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@hardcoredude33 Invaders Must Die by The Prodigy
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@mrquazu he says it at the end =P
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaeveryone says this looks stupid but to me this looks AWSOME!! and i cant wait for it to come out
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThe comic book is soo good! it&#39;s like a gamer movie that IS a video game... hard to explain.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@jonnydarkmusic 
Yes, THANK YOU! I freakin love No More Heroes. They even have an energy sword battle. 
If only this movie could be used to boost its popularity...
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@jonnydarkmusic 
Yes, THANK YOU! I freakin love No More Heroes. If only this movie could be used to boost its popularity...
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitait looks stupid as fuck but i kinda wanna see it for some reason
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Fadedlife12 
no, It&#39;s ex #4
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@paboy4 Thats exactly what I think! He&#39;s talented and all, but in no way threatening! Also if you read the actual graphic novel the character is nothing like what Cera portrays.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@eSilva90 haha yes. that&#39;s his archetypal character which he always plays. i don&#39;t complain though since i like his character
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@jokernotfunny no like i said Aaron Johnson or the guy from zombieland there pretty good at doing wimp roles and even look like geeks is just that micheal cera looks way to small and wimpy for the role but hes a great actor
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@paboy4 no way, he&#39;s perfect for this role. he&#39;s overcoming his wimpiness to win her; which is ensued by hilarity.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitalooks like it could fun
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaIt looks sooo cheesy ...that it seems cool. But kets see what will happen...

7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@MacDaddyRiggles The only similarity is that they both have laser swords and No More Heros is a video game. People are stupid sometimes, I bet if this came out with the first star wars movie people would say it&#39;s exactly like that too T_T
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@DJBludLust yea i agree they should had atleast Aaron Johnson the guy from Kick-ass or the guy from zombieland, i like micheal cera but hes just too wimpy for this roll
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@AdamHatter It&#39;s Love
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@DJBludLust  micheal cera is perfect for this movie who else do you think can do this role zac efron? 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaLOOKS AWESOME!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitawhat a peice of shit. comic and movie
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitastupid
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Fadedlife12 yes a slightly overweight ninja girl :P
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaMichael Cera should sooo not be in this movie 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Fadedlife12 ex 4 is a chick
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaLooks like the disney channel on crack
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@julijan999 ...Ever read the books? No? Then don&#39;t talk about the story. And according to people who have seen early screenings the actors play perfect parts.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@julijan999 You know, call me crazy, but how about we wait until the movie comes out before judging it entirely, hmm?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Slayerlx Yeah, he&#39;s more awkward than &#39;can&#39;t stop because he doesn&#39;t know the word stop&#39; that Scott Pilgrim is.

I won&#39;t lost sleep over it, but it&#39;s not the best casting.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@carlsiouxfalls You&#39;re thinking about it too hard.

As far as I can tell, it&#39;s just a metaphor for proving yourself worthy beyond what she&#39;s experienced in the past.  Just a fun way to illustrate &#39;dealing with your baggage&#39;.

Plus it&#39;s the whole drive of the movie.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaLooks funnier than the first trailer made it out to be.

But why do the first 6 ex-boyfriends want the girl? I can understand the 7th wanting to keep her, but did the first 6 fight each other for her before Scott Pilgrim came along?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaOmfg! i just read the first book, and it is soooo funny...

I want to see the movie even more now that i watched the trailer... lol
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaYAY another damn movie this guy plays a socially awkward teenager...

7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@sketchyou  lol u mean movie!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitalol i wanna see this but i think the end of the trailer spoiled the movie D:
they break up like she says &quot;Maybe next time we don&#39;t date the girl with 11 ex boyfriends&quot; 2:20
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t WAIT to Watch This Show!!!  Looks Awesome!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaCreative... I like it.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaDUDE! I can&#39;t wait for this FUCKING game! So excited.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaI want to hate this cause i love the books and don&#39;t want this to be ruined by people who see the movie and miss out on the comic... BUT I LOVE IT and can&#39;t wait!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@trekkian88 Wow you are an idiot sir. How are you going to judge a movie you haven&#39;t even seen yet? Especially in this day and age when it seems all that Hollywood  does is remakes or the 500th sequel to some movie that should never even have a sequel in the first place. This movie actually looks entertainig and is original in its concept. So quit being a juvenile troller, pack up your Star trek toys and move out of your moms basement you virgin.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@trekkian88 See, I know you&#39;re trolling, but you make me laugh because you reminded me of watch?v=URsqTsMfNqY
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@jonnydarkmusic i totally agree with this comment, the ex&#39;s are like equivalents to the whacky bosses. and i love how they dissolve into coins when he defeats&quot;bad guys&quot;
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThis might be an actually good part for Michael Cera.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathis is so cool like :O
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaits looks cool and fake and gay @ the same time...
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitai probably wont see this
even tho the girls with the pink hair is hot
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@DavidMann meh i jus dont like comic books especially pretty entertaining ones getting butchered on the big screen is all
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaWhy, Michael Cera, WHY? /facepalm
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitacomic book movie how original
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathe world doesn&#39;t need more movies starring michael cera.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitamust watch fo sho!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like a movie version of No More Heroes! (even though the comic pre-dates no more heroes)
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita2:11 ;)
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaLesbian?
....Lesbians?
Hahahaha This looks awesome!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathis trailer makes me want to do ecstasy. 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaf*** what he do! WHAT HE DO!!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@polkafrenzy666 Well Brain did say in an interview that the movie will be a bit different then the book, it&#39;s do able.  The movie still looks great and it doesn&#39;t look like Micheal Cera is going to be a fuck up.  Plus Edgar Wright is a mad genius, the have no doubts in his ability. 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be EPIC... I love the first &quot;Evil Ex&quot;  Cris Angel in a Freddy Krueger shirt. 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThis will be awesome!!!!!
btw anyone know the name of the soundtrack in the trailer?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaGood to see Paul Roberton&#39;s sprite from the game make a cameo in the movie.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@ICPxPyrohand My guess is that it was set on private. 
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaReminds me of No More Heroes.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@shiopi Yes, but more than the movie, I want the final book to be released.
I read all 5 books in one day... today... and the cliffhanger at the end of book 5 is killing me.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaLooks extremely faithful to the comic, like 90% of the stuff they showed was actually from the books. Can&#39;t wait!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@auraldemolition Do keep the 8-bit spirit alive, I guess.

Although it really drives home just how much Michael Cera really, REALLY doesn&#39;t look anything close to how O&#39;Malley draws Scott, does he?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaWTF! HAHAHAHAAHAHA I&#39;ll watch it!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaDude, this is even better than the first one!!!!!!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaI really like how alot of the lines from the books are in this trailer :D
also 0:53 thats Knives right?
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@Teralenko Songs featured in trailer.
‘Great DJ’ – The Ting Tings
‘Big Ideas’ – LCD Soundsystem
‘Black Hole’ – Be Your Own Pet
‘Gum’ – Cornelius
‘It’s Getting Boring By The Sea’ – Blood Red Shoes
‘Invaders Must Die’ – The Prodigy
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaThis literally looks like it will blow my mind.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaDisappointed that the 1-UP isn&#39;t a floating Michael Cera head. But really excited. Kieran Culkin seems like he will be a much better Wallace than I first thought.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@KironVB no man it&#39;s The Prodigy - Invaders Must Die....great song
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaGod is Dragonball Evolution had these kinda FXs and a way better script it would of ROCKED this movie is gonna be killer!!!!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@KironVB Nope, there&#39;s The Ting Tings (the guitar riff at the opening), and something else, then the electro-y track is The Prodigy, Invaders Must Die
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaIs that Pendulum I hear in the trailer ;D
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshita@ICPxPyrohand It was probably pre-uploaded but set as private so no one could see it, but it was ready to go once they wanted to launch it.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitait was SOOOO fuck AMAZING!
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitathis is very much awesome.
7wd5KEaOtm4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaOMG That was Blink! MOAR!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshita*-*
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshita0:25 OMFG LOOK SO ALIKE TO JODIE FROM BEYOND TWO SOULS WTFFFFFFF
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathey&#39;ll probably explain it in the second trailer. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaSoundtrack is from the movie &#39;Sunshine&#39; /watch?v=SMVik3EFVn4

Thumbs up so people can see!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathis trailer is pretty bad, but don&#39;t get me wrong i am waiting forward to this movie, but I am even more nervous about it now
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaso invented time machine
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathe Music so so but everything else about it man i love hoe different it look&#39;s 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitalooks awesome

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT !!

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaIts nothing like &#39;time&#39;, its from the &#39;sunshine&#39; soundtrack /watch?v=SMVik3EFVn4
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaYeeees Omar Sy ! C&#39;est tellement puissant de le voir dans ce film !
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaExactly my thoughts xD
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathis trailer gave me chillsss...
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaRemember the ethics class in Last Stand? The case study, the guy in the hospital, was his twin brother. He transferred his consciousness to him (the nurse in that scene was Moira McTaggart, so she may be re-appearing too).
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaHey, another trailer with music that sounds like it was stolen from Inception. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitawas that warpath?
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitawow..

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshita@omelete Wow!!  Demais cara
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaJohn Murphy - The Surface of the sun
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitawell damn.
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaTrailer does nothing me, like most of the X-Men films. 

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaThe Lannisters sends their regards.  
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaUMMMM YOU FORGOT TO ADD PERFECTION WHERE IS EVAN PETERS?
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to watch it!!!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaIt is &quot;Time&quot;. Often films will re-use music for the trailer from other films because the final score isn&#39;t finished yet.
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaTake out the sound of Logan&#39;s &quot;scream&quot; and make it silent... and then the trailer is pretty decent.  With the sound... it feels &quot;chopped&quot;.
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathe trailer song is from city of bones it looks amazing can&#39;t wait for this movie
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaSó eu vim aqui pelo Van do Halen ???? \m/

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaI was promised the sentinels ... I better see them! 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaWHERE&#39;S EVAN FUCKING PETERS?
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaHmmmmm looks decent......been awhile for an xmen movie
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaRelax, it&#39;s just the first one ;-)
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshita**oh lord have mercy on my soul**
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaOMG this maybe the best comic book to movie film EVER!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaOfficial trailer at 360p? Bravo.
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaI think I just cried and shit my pants at the same time. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaBig big big kudos to all who recognized the song Adagio in D Minor by John Murphy in this.  It&#39;s from Danny Boyle&#39;s movie Sunshine.  Beautiful score and movie. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitamy fangirl heart cannot. just cannot

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!! I&#39;m excited

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaTyrion i saw that you came from past! 1:46
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaWas that Blink?

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see &quot;epic&quot;; all I see is drama. I guess Bryan Singer doesn&#39;t know how to make an epic trailer. See Captain America: The Winter Soldier. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaDamn, thats some cast. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaEllen!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaThe actor who plays Bishop is exactly what i expected. I missed his long hair - He shaved it in the latest year&#39;s comics-.
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaGOOSEBUMPS !!!!!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaMy guess...? 
That&#39;s the moment he gets sent back in time. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitalooks good and I&#39;ll go see it but not an overwhelming trailer
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaLooks good but you can tell the music is a direct rip off of &quot;Time&quot; from inception. but i understand that thats the feel they were going for. so Kudo&#39;s lol. 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaSir Patrick Stewart is the Best!!!!!!!!!! Amazing Trailer!!! 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so anxious for this upcoming movie
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitawoa...

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaWow finally an X-Men movie I&#39;m going to have to see in the theater!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitame gusta

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshita&quot;Logan, I was a very different man.&quot; Yes, you were James McAvoy. It feels refreshing to me to see a full length superhero trailer that focuses on character rather than just blowing stuff up and silly quips. I&#39;m definitely game.


pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaMuuuuuito foda!
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaYeah this movie, Captain America and Thor are a must see for me.

pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitathat looks like shit
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so badass
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaInception song? 
pK2zYHWDZKodelimeterByIshitaThey must change the past to save their future. <br><br>Watch the trailer world premiere for X-Men: Days of Future Past now!
