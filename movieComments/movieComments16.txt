hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why the police didn&#39;t just tell the people there&#39;s PIRANHA IN THE FUCKEN LAKE
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitathere&#39;s a scene where a piranha gets in this girl and she has sex with this guy and right before the guy cums the piranha bites off his dick scariest part in the movie 😂
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaNo u don&#39;t have a pet piranha like this +Latasha gilliory

hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaStupid teenagers...
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaI enjoyed this movie...
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaPiranhas are not actually that attracted to blood as much as you think
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaOne of worst CGI.. Fuck piranha, you fucking stole my pancake

hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen this movie yet but I already know what my favorite line is:<br><a href="http://youtu.be/hKVY94MpUiE?t=1m34s">1:34</a><br>&quot;Piranha hunt in packs. The first bite draws blood, the blood draws the pack.&quot;<br><br>Christopher Lloyd you are the man!
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitai died when i watched this.. people are so retarded smh lol
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaI wish they didn&#39;t advertise this movie so seriously.
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t they ever make a horror movie without all these snotty high school/college kids? It gets old.
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s an idea: JUST STAY OUT OF THE FUCKING WATER!
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so freaking funny!!!!<br>I was laughing so hard when I saw the first preview of this when the girl got pulled in the water!!<br>XD<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PIRANHA">#PIRANHA</a>
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaSurprisingly very good! lol it looked like a cheap b-movie parody, but it&#39;s actually really intense at parts, funny &amp; EXTREMELY bloody- probably pushes R-rated movie boundaries tbh lol. Oh, and the acting is actually good for this type of movie. definitely recommend. 
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaWow that is so scary I&#39;m scared to go to any lakes at all
hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaDo not watch if your scared of blood-R

hKVY94MpUiEdelimeterByIshitaFirst comment...ever...most likely last
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThanks dearie. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaAs a lover of all things Disney and with Mary Poppins being my favorite movie out of all of them,  this movie makes me EXTREMELY happy :D
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible, holy crap. I can&#39;t believe how many times I skipped this ad before realizing what it was and actually stopping to watch it.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome that Tom Hanks is playing Walt Disney.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaSame exact thing happened to me. I used to believe Internet ads didn&#39;t affect me. Today, I was wrong.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t usually watch ads on youtube, but once and a while I&#39;m glad they show up. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but you sure don&#39;t look like it....
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThat looks good
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI have waited for a movie like this for so long 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaimagine if Julie Andrews were to play Travers.... THE FEELS
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaChim-chimney 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI heard about this but really excited its official now. CAN&#39;T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThat akward moment when you find out that lady played Nanny Mcphee.... 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaOMG! Thank you for pointing that out. :)
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitadisney is an evi empire walt d was  a 33 degree freemason and a satan worshiper..adults that are way into disney freak me out to no end..get a life
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitathought this was Cody Banks : / fuck
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitasoooo excited for this!!! mary poppins is my favorite Disney movie, and the real story behind it looks interesting... and this movie just looks good!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaso ready for this movie
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitahanks as disney is genius!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita666 in &quot;Disney&quot; , but i gotta admit, they make good movies :D
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaBeyond excited for this!! I saw some of the filming on Hollywood Blvd when I exited El Capitan last year. CAN&#39;T WAIT!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI think Ian Mc Kellen could be the best Disney
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaPOTC was rated PG-13.  As were Prince of Persia, John Carter, and Lone Ranger.  Only this is different because it&#39;s more like a drama as opposed to a popcorn flick.

Well, don&#39;t forget that Mary Poppins did end with Mr. Banks reconciling with his children.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that started playing at 2:10? 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThe Iceberg that hit the Titanic?   The further they dive into this superficial nonsense the more Mars Needs Moms, John Carter, and Lone Ranger films they are going to bomb with.   Walt Disney was a blue personality:

&quot;Need to have integrity and be appreciated. They are focused on quality and creating strong relationships.&quot;

The company (as well as Tom Hanks&#39;s portrayal) are moving into Red (tough leader) mixed with yellow (let&#39;s have fun).   Pixar and Marvel are they only things saving them.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitawell, I&#39;m off to fangirl and research the ever loving hell outta this movie 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to know the production then go to San Franciso and see the Walt Disney Family Museum.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks sounds nothing like Walt Disney
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be AWESOME!  Mary Poppins is one of my all time favorite musicals! 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaA movie about a 33 degree Mason who wishes to dazzle the public with a story about a witch. 

How delightful!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaWalt Disney was a racist freemason why wasn&#39;t any that in the trailer? 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaGetting to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney.....DUDE THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HONOR! XD JUST AS BIG AS GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND MEETING THE PRESIDENT! XD
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaOkay that actually looks pretty good! XD LOVE TOM HANKS, DEFIANTLY ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME! XD 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitasimply stunning! . dont waste time guys , rush to this site and get ur ipad3 or iphone as per ur choice. dont think its funny, never forget to fill with your mail id and ph number. have a try and enjoy :)  &gt;-&gt;  bit.ly/12On43J?=pkrnkp
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaEmma and Tom are incredible! This movie is going to be AMAZING!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitafuck walt disney
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThey should make movie like this after this movie I was thinking if they would be a able to make a movie like how they made Snow White and all the Disney animated movies that Walt Disney made
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks realy good, but I think Ryan Gosling would have looked more like Walt. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaim cant wait to see this I love Mary poppins. Now I wanna see this lol #marypoppins
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitalol &quot;now where is mr disney? i&#39;de like to see what porn he&#39;s got in his office&quot; XD

if you&#39;re tough enough then you would not block this
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this...but yeah would have been nice to do the Fantasyland scenes on the carousel as a composite and build the original facades in CGI as it was then. Kind of breaks the illusion for anyone that&#39;s been there before the 80s. More expensive but very doable. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitathis...this is a movie that needed to be told. A movie for people to see and understand the beauty and the wonder behind the woman who gave birth to Marry Poppins, and the man who brought her out of her pages, and onto the moving screen...one day I will be in those shoes, and I will be the one working to make something to make children smile and laugh...of this I swear
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitatom hanks can make him self look like anybody
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita“He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” ― George Orwell, 1984
Do we really want the man that played Forest Gump to etch into history a FALSE version of this man Disney? Was he really this lovable? Seems to me The Disney company is going to far,expensive, reaches to cover up a true past.
And, it will happen. And, they will succeeded. because. Think critically people. Disney has been raising us for years. And we allow it to happen. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaYeah it was the Mickey Mouse Club Theater (renamed the Fantasyland Theater in 1964) at the time !
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaInteresting, alright my Disney you have my attention
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaDisappointed that it&#39;s not 1960&#39;s Fantasyland...the Pinocchio ride wasn&#39;t around until 1983.

nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitatrailer shows too much
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaoh gosh!!! no way!!! I wana see this!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI am SO EXCITED for this movie to come out! It looks so beautiful and inspiring; oh I just know it will be an incredible story. Not to mention the fact that it takes place in the 60s; omg I just cannot wait! Movies that take place in the 50s and 60s makes me feel so good, like I&#39;m living in that time period. Plus it&#39;ll be great to hear the story of how Mary Poppins came to be, and of Walt Disney himself. I cannot wait!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks looks like hulk Hogan

nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaDude, Tom Hanks looks like Hitler.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaso excited 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita&quot;How many people get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?&quot; nobody!!! Oh MY GOD, I would die to be able to go Disney with Walt Disney himself! 
and Tom Hanks was a great choice to play for Walter. being the voice of Woody from Toy Story, a freaking great Disney movie, he would know the magic needed to be Disney. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaoh yes this looks so good. I cannot wait.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitacan any one tell me what song they used for the trailer!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks as Walt Disney, is just magical! he is Disney! 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI like the trailer more &amp; more every time I watch it!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaIf only someone would stand up to Michael Bay.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaKatie Herzig - Lost and Found is the song used at the end of the trailer. You&#39;re welcome!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita3 thumbs down?  Really?  Some people are dead inside.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaDid you see the trailer it&#39;s about the making of Mary Poppins.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaWords can not describe my excitement.  I have never been this excited about a movie.  Ever.  EVER.  EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaHow intresting. A biographical movie about Walt Disney? Cool I&#39;ll go see it.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so awesome.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI won&#39;t even have to drag my family with me to see this! :D
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitait brings me to tears and i dont know why :&#39;(
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaYou know you done good when you got me to watch an entire 3 minute ad. 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome! but seriously Tom Hanks, worst pick for Walt Disney possible!! ugg that might ruin the whole movie...
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThe part before she wakes up on the plane?
&quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI WILL see it, i am like one of the greatest disney fans and this is totally AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty awesome
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI am so excited I&#39;m jumping around atm 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita1:19 OMG, Ryan the Temp as one of the Sherman Bros. :D
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI personally am excited for this! The only thing I have to nitpick is the casting for Walt Disney! I mean, I love Tom Hanks, but he doesn&#39;t really look anything like Walt Disney. But besides that, I am gonna really love it!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this so fucking bad.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m crying...i dont know why...maybe is bc i really want to se this movie that look so beautiful
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song in the beginning of the trailer ?
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshita2:16

who else finds that old black and white pictures are scary, especially ones with one person pictured?
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThe picture quality looks amazing. What cameras were used?
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!!!!  I can&#39;t wait!!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks as Walt Disney.  I think we have a winner.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this movie

nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaHuh?
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaAre you okay that Walt Disney is a buisness that have been making the smartest decisions since dumbo.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see this movie so bad!! I can&#39;t wait to see Tom Hanks play Walt!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI just can&#39;t stop watching this! The first time I saw this trailer....I cried.  The next time I saw it....I can&#39;t stop clapping!  Over and Over and Over....I just can&#39;t wait!  Tom appears to be doing a great job as Walt.....I&#39;m just so excited to see this movie!  Open! Open! Open! It will be SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!!!!  YAY!!!
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! Im so glad they turned the pre-production of Mary Poppins into a film. And I like how they did stick to the basics of what actually happened.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wipe away the smile that&#39;s on my face every time I watch this trailer.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaWalt Disney! =D 
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaOH LORD. I love Mary Poppins- especially the underrated message that it was Mr Banks who needed to change- and I know I&#39;m going to love this so much. Thank you thank you thank you.
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaLook at how beautiful disneyland looks
nijccxWvyXUdelimeterByIshitaThe one thing that bothers me about this film is the fact that it&#39;s rated PG-13! ANOTHER Disney movie rated PG-13!
--
I mean, &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot;, I understand; they always have been rated that! But now it&#39;s &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, &quot;John Carter&quot;, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, soon &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;, and now THIS! Is Disney Studios now OKAY with the fact that they&#39;re releasing PG-13-rated films nowadays instead of films for the whole family?

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was great but I wish that he had a little more variety in how he kills he stayed behind a turret for the whole climax which kind of sucked but hey it was a awesome movie overall all we need now is a good video game

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaWhatever this movie are very action modern present day film but still look as the original in 1980s style,This movie have a lot of meaning and the meaning in this Rambo 4 movie series franchise and the most I like the movie is story about the cold war in Vietnam and still look realistic.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaEs duro, sucio,groso venoso...
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaHow did I miss this movie! First Blood is a classic and excellent, 2 and 3 spoilt by silly bits. This one is just great. Thanks for getting my attention.

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaRambo; Last Blood - Official Trailer (2019) | Movieclips Trailers
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the better sylvester stallone performances in my opinion
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshita&quot;When you are pushed killing is easy as breathing.&quot; John Rambo.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaBetter than all three Expandables, hopefully Rambo 5 will be kickass.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever made.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThe first 3 films of this series have been easily the more intelligent and relatable, for instance the 3rd film had at least some character development and spiritual and political side it was developing by showing how Soviets didn&#39;t learn from The US involvement in Vietnam, it even dared to go beyond the characters and more into philosophical matters of politics, sacrifice, self awareness, loyalty and serving Gods. I wish the next film tries to enrich its storyline without compensating for it by trying to be so-called realistic. It is not more realistic than any other Rambo film, it&#39;s an interpretation of realism, to be realistic you&#39;d have to be there and being shot at. Realism in movies is an illusion based on subjective perception, what was deemed realistic 50 years ago can be cheesy now. If you were on battlefield you&#39;d rarely ever see in such detail all the mayhem, you try to look away, this movie seems cartoonish to some people exactly because it revels in its violent detail, therefore it&#39;s harder to take seriously. Interpretation of realism is the key, not realism itself, that is an illusion driven by ego pushing an agenda of how reality is, remember everyone perceives reality differently, and audience naturally responds to a film as a piece of fiction and not as a documentary, but it can help them look into the things the film is based on. In terms of quality it&#39;s easily the weakest film of the series, but still good. There&#39;s a reason for the bigger success of the first 3 films, they were enjoyed equally by both males and females, because that was more light hearted to show dark realities of war, it was the interpretation that made a difference. One can not make a difference if the film is told in an inaccesible way, this sequel is more niche for niche audience than the first 3 films which were more mainstream with wider appeal. You use a specific tool and style to shine light on something, so far this film was as accessible almost as a documentary rather than a film seen by most. Filmmakers were even indecisive whether to use f bomb in the second film, that&#39;s how it matterd how they sell their interpretation of reality, because they knew that it&#39;s about selling awareness of such events to help people look into them more, realism should be the least of the concern when the audience doesn&#39;t take films as an evidence of what is real, people know it is not a documentary, why try selling it this way by alienating your wider and bigger audience?? Use the way that MOST people can stay with and look through.<br><br>To me it&#39;s a switch the brain off type of mindless action, 3/4th of the film is a video game non stop violence, not much development of characters like in most action war films, here the third act goes nowhere, straight forward by the numbers action film. The more you employ your brain the dumber the film appears to be.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThe bad things about Rambo IV:<br><br>I. It&#39;s gratuitous hard R-rating.<br>II. They put some unlikable mercenary rejects in the film instead of bringing back <b>The Force of Freedom</b> from the animated series.<br>III. The plot is too much like a Missing in Action III on steroids, even the rejected scripts had better sounding plots.<br>IV. The hostages were also unlikable, even though they added a lot to the plot, they didn&#39;t make anything satisfying.<br>V. The action scenes are too unrealistic to the point where it looks like Tropic Thunder.<br>VI. No tie-in video game of Rambo IV<br>VII. Couldn&#39;t they just make Rambo go after ISIS in England, France and Afghanistan instead of reinacting the war from Rambo: First Blood Part II?!<br>VIII. This movie was too short and too cliché.<br>IX. No explosive arrows...<br>X. No remarkable quotes...
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaTrailer sucks
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie.  Rambo V needs to be made and I suggest that it is about Rambo vs The Republic of Gilead (Handmaids Tale)   It could double as the cinematic season finale to that series and save it from dragging on past it&#39;s expiry date.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaSlymachine
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThe best of the franchise...the graphics are so realistic!
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitabest rambo ever
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaSuch a wicked sequel. Amazing film. They messed up one thing though. Why wasn&#39;t any of the original score used in this film? It would have made the film a million times better.

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the problem with a lot of small time town policemen - they think they are kings when in fact they are only small fry. They abuse and harass quiet innocent people who do nothing just because they do not like how they look or smell like. a lot of them are like these.

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaPeople complain about this movie because it shows the harsh, cruel, and ugly realities of warfare... In case you were wondering, Yes, there are places in the world where children are being thrown into fires. It&#39;s not &quot;excessive movie violence&quot;, it&#39;s called &quot;reality&quot;. Sorry to burst your bubble, folks.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaI just saw a Rambo film in my collection.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaI totally thought this is the best Rambo movie ever. Hopefully there will be a Rambo 5 movie coming soon. I love the Rambo movies more than the Rocky movies. Don&#39;t get me wrong Sylvester Stallone is a great actor and all his movies are very good even the Rocky movies. I just prefer the Rambo movies instead of anything.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThe only two Rambo films I think were worth caring about: First Blood and Rambo IV. Even David Morrell, the writer of First Blood liked this movie more than the other sequels.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaNOSE VE TAMAÑO GRANDE Y NOSE ESCUCHA EN ESPAÑOL Q PUEDO HACER O SI LO PUEDEN HACER USTEDES POR FAVOR GRACIAS Y TODAS LAS DESEO VER EN TODA LA PANTALLA Y EN ESPAÑOL GRACIAS

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaLove the movie but my God this trailer is garbage😂
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaWith all the Rambo movies that&#39;s  Sylvester Stallone did the fourth Rambo movie it is my number one top favorite of all the Rambo movies. The thing that I&#39;m surprised about with this movie is the fact that they didn&#39;t say it was a Rambo 4 it&#39;s just called Rambo. I am hoping there will be a Rambo 5. I am also hoping that Sylvester Stallone plays in Rambo 5. I heard some talk about a remake for the first Rambo movie I don&#39;t know if this is true or false I hope it&#39;s not true though I hate remakes and reboot movies. Seems like every time they try to do reboots or a remake movie the windup ruining the story and it does not do good in the movie theaters I&#39;m just being honest here. Look a couple the movies they already did when they did remakes and reboots they pretty much failed in the movie theaters. So I hope this is false no remake of Rambo. If Sylvester Stallone does not do a Rambo 5 movie then I think they should do a TV series for Rambo. I think it could be done and I think it would turn out great if they had the right person to play Rambo if they did the TV series. I truly would love to see them do this in a CG type of thing.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitajjg
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is way, way underrated. This trailer starts well, but ends making it look like it&#39;s mindless action, when the movie is not. For the most part Rambo&#39;s character follows a very logical arc, and the story makes a good attempt at having an actual purpose, real meaning. When it does go into action, it&#39;s incredibly realistic and intense. Probably the most intense war scenes ever put to film (yes, I saw Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down).
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThis is the Far Cry movie, takes place in the wilderness, there&#39;s an evil and relentless dictator, psycho soldiers, wild animals, assassinations, and The Bow n Arrow.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaАсма Владимир<br>жизнь
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie. Only thing I didn&#39;t like was the fake CG gore. They should have gone with practical FX.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaHard to believe that a movie as brutally violent &amp; upsetting as this all came from Sly&#39;s vision
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaThis might just be the worst Rambo movie ever made
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaI heard that Slyvester Stallone wants to retire in Vietnam.

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaTo Live for Nothing, To Die for Something is Sylvester Stallone Best Quote in this Movie.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaHe really looks he could grab both the 1982 and 1985 versions of himself by their necks, rip their throats out and then barbacue their tracheas for dinner...a savage
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaCOBRAAA
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie, and thought it wrapped up Rambo&#39;s story perfectly. He got pulled back into a life that he tryed to leave behind, KICKED ASS!!!! Then finlly manged to get to the place where he was trying to go to in 1st blood, home.
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaO MELHOR SEMPRE SERA....

2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like how they make Stallones voice louder in the trailer to make him sound clearer, it makes him sound like Robocop
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitamust watch!
2CRjdwRYQbUdelimeterByIshitaCome on, Rocky Balboa trailer was so much better than this trailer. The movie was good, but this trailer reeks of  the 90´s VHS era.

MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaI was wrong, I was wrong, it was- it was weird, it&#39;s weird like that, it&#39;s not, it doesn&#39;t sound cool.

Anyone could say that, but seth rogen says it the best
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be an epic duo. 
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita&quot;And I never wash them&quot; Gah! I&#39;m definitely gonna see this. Joseph and Seth are the main reasons.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@savagegalt 
stop giving a fk about things like that. people like u are annoying.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaToo bad Seth rogen is in it
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@ladzehlauren 
Youtube won&#39;t allow me to post the link but search for &quot;scientists cure cancer but no one takes notice&quot; on Google and go the first result.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitathis movie seems so nice..iam soooooooo watching it!!!
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@joiseygene Well, that makes the two of us... at least... :-))) 

MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@1stnaruto  A little thing called kicking the bucket list.....
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@llovejersey  ...Yes he does, I totally see that. He does, no shit. BTW; I love Jersey too...:)
Regards,
Joisey Gene

MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@ScottyMcGeester yeah, what is the cure?
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitamaking fun of cancer in a movie? Good job hollywood!
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaseems decent enough, Seth and JGL are awesome actors
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@ScottyMcGeester what&#39;s the cure?
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@ScottyMcGeester chemo?
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaWeird and funny thing is, there&#39;s already a cure for cancer. The pharmaceutical companies and the media just aren&#39;t interested in it. 
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up for Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros! This is going to be an excellent movie.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaJoseph Gordon Levitt is SO talented!!! I love him!! And anna Kendrick is in the movie too? Ah, I am most definitely watching it.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitahes prof X!

MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaLooks good! 
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@llovejersey YES.. somebody finally says it!
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitathat is the best line i have heard when trying to cheer up someone who could die, insensative yet amusing - &quot;if you were a casino game you would have the best odds&quot;
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaThis will be great! But we all know that.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitathis is what we need now, a comedy about cancer. I&#39;m gonna see this movie
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve yet to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in something I didn&#39;t enjoy. His presents just makes the movie some how.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@llovejersey 
totally - I&#39;ve always thought (since Ledger died) that he should play the next joker in batman...
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitacool song!
yeah :)
i have cancer....
euuuhm
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaQuiero ver esta peliii!! este actor me recuerda mucho a Heath ledger! Y_Y
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitajust wondering...why do people who have cancer always shave their head??
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaJoseph Gordon Levitt looks like a young kevin spacet,,,
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaAHHAAH! 2:06

MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaJoseph Gorden Levitt....
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaJoseph Gordon Levitt... &lt;3
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is it supposed to be? A comedy? A drama? Because for a comedy it is a very serious subject yet to be a drama there&#39;s the not so serious Seth Rogen.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaif u were in a casion game u would have best odds
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@DeliversOnTuesday :-)))) You got me wrong. That&#39;s not why I thought they were bros, cuz their name sounds similar. It&#39;s how they looked back then. :-)
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@llovejersey Ledger and Levitt...sound similer. And I think he plays a cop :D
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@DeliversOnTuesday Really, hi is? I didn&#39;t know about it. Years ago when I saw them together in Ten things I hate about you I thought they were brothers...
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@llovejersey Maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah, looks great.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitayay a new movie to watch while stoned
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaBoring :(
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshita@kevinstube13 that was a rumor. eventually he will play a cop in TDKR
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaJoseph reminds me of Heath Ledger.
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen is awesome!!!
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaonce you have cancer..GO live life and do stupid things!
MiMlrrA2PRkdelimeterByIshitaUm? In the end it&#39;s like &quot;These are not the Tumors your looking for&quot;(Wave Hand).....Meaning he doesn&#39;t have Tumors.

RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song playing towards the end of this trailer?
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone knows what music is playing after 25 secs of this trailer
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaHilarious: Hollywood thinks they can engineer society to accept women who sleep with 100 guys as if they&#39;re comparable to a man who has seduced lots of women.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG3Q2ua5izw&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a>
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitathis is a modern day when harry met sally. anyone agree?
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitathis is a modern day when harry met sally. anyone agree?
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaliterally gonna see this only cuz Natasha lyonne is in it. 😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍😍
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaI must know the name of that actress at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG3Q2ua5izw&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a>!
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d totally watch a cam of this.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of Friends With Benefits. They meet, they say they&#39;re friends, they start fucking, he/she stops it, then they realize they&#39;re in love, they have a big honkin fight, then yippee doodle, they&#39;re together, happy ending! Typical 21st century Hollywood movie.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitancion romanticise de chela
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWant to see this for the Rafi
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshita????That song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG3Q2ua5izw&amp;t=0m26s">0:26</a> ????
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaJeez, monogamy isn&#39;t your only option hello? It would be nice to see some open relationships in hollywood, a nice moment of realisation of &#39;holy shit, i may actually be happier being with the person I love with no sexual commitment&quot;, they have an emotional talk and then sail off into a future of swinging and key parties. <br>It&#39;s not like it doesn&#39;t exist, people have been doing it for centuries! This neo-puritan romance bullshit isn&#39;t what makes marriages work, it&#39;s infantilising a whole generation so they depend on buying things in place of building a healthy sense of self.<br>Also, I don&#39;t buy either of them as sex addicts.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaIm in love with this, and i will totally go see it...but why is it premiering on 9/11??
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite character in these movie <br>1.ADAM SCOTT<br>2.ALISON<br>3.JASON 
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshita I cannot believe that there&#39;s no nudity in this movie. Normally nudity is a like a requirement in comedy movies. 
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaBeing a sex addict as a man takes a considerable amount of skill. Being a sex addict as a woman takes the ability to open your legs.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaI hope trudy knows what shes doing, Pete Campbell will not be happy 
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaNatasha Lyonne &lt;3
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this song that plays at the end of this PLEASE HELP!!! 😫😫😫
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWho is the girl in the very beginning of this trailer. The one who pushes him in front of that car.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaJust as Thanks for Sharing was successful in and for its authenticity, this is the bitter opposite- quite offensive really - especially to those of us who have loved ones in recovery or have lost others completely to the disease. Worst of all, addicts won&#39;t find solace, humor or understanding here. IFC usually does so much better.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitawhat are the songs in this trailer?
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaha wow a modern day rape of when harry met sally and the rom com continues. When will women stop watching rom coms?  I&#39;d like to see a number of movies with this same basic plot. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s about 16% of all movies ever made.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaCan someone please tell me who the girl is at the beginning. The one who pushes jason into the street, he calls her Hannah <br>
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song at the end of trailer?
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve always thought that Jason Sudeikis was so hot, and this pretty much cemented it.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaHaha.. that was really good jump
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWeaksauce version of &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitasuch a typical chick flick that chicks feel ashamed of watching the trailer
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaLol a lot of guys have been up there just not you.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshita
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWhat kind of dumbass trash movie tittles are these

RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaThe song in the first minute is Chela - Romanticise
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaWow.... JUST SLEEP AROUND WITH EVERYBODY .. Right ??
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaIs there anyone who thinks Sudeikis is a big deal? I have never understood that. Do chicks really dig him or something? I never understood how he got Olivia Wilde either.
RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaUgh. Only in American movies to people not bother to take the bra off when having sex. Really pisses me off. Either have a movie about sex or don&#39;t.

RG3Q2ua5izwdelimeterByIshitaAdam Brody is hilarious <br>who is better than my brother , lol
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Allen&#39;s fault
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshitaso it&#39;s die hard... on a plane, with snakes.
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerwquA1TKs&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a>
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshitaThese days snakes on a plane don&#39;t scare me as much as Karens on a plane.
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshitaDo you guys know who that narrator guy is with the good voice who reads &quot;Go TF to sleep&quot;? I can&#39;t remember his name but there&#39;s this cool tribal psybient mix with his face only totally trippy... Anyway, I was just bothering Malcolm X in my thoughts only, and he didn&#39;t know what to say other than he likes the masks these days and to keep on politics and stuff. Thanks dude. I hope that was really him, but who knows. Inspiration and that. Denzel in distress, is that an old pun or a new one? And do you have any cautionary tales?
rerwquA1TKsdelimeterByIshitaSh-e-et, this is some dumb movie, classic Denzel

iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaGenre: Comedy
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaΑΝΑΤΡΙΧΙΑΣΑ!!!!!!!!!!!
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaYeah people will be losing their minds in theaters , no 3D needed
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaLooks damn good.  I&#39;m there
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis literally looks like a lazy Friday few beers idea.  What movie can we make? any ideas? yes lets get 2 women stick them on top of a pole as they are used to it, then lets throw some drama into it about sliding down the pole. Tired of the weak ideas
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitalooks cool and all got goosebumps, but... after a tragic event why wouldn1t you registzer yourself or at least let some other ppl know that you are climbing something like this?? They should be experts or what, not dumb beginners
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIn the words of another movie coming out NOPE!..
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIf they were base jumpers, this wouldn&#39;t have been a problem.  Then again, it would have been a short and (relatively) uneventful movie if they did bring parachutes.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaI swear people do the stupidist things endangering their own lives...and what&#39;s with the &quot;no signal&quot; when you&#39;re in the area higher than buildings and shit that blocks signals?
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhen your Acrophobia kicks in
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaTHIS movie should be called NOPE.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaI mean this in the nicest way possible and as a compliment but, F you to the filmmakers for making something that is truly tapping into my phobia of heights 😭😭😭
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshita@Lionsgate Movies<br>When is Expendables 4 trailer coming?? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23expendables4">#Expendables4</a>
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhy not climb a mountain or something that isn’t likely to break? Why not tell people “hey I’m doing this dangerous thing if you don’t hear from my by X time call for a rescue”
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaUnfortunately no subtitles.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaAt 2000 feet no signal ...911 🛩🏢🤔
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaFuck off as if her mate would be able to grab that pole and not snap her arm 😂😂😂😂 I just watched that part back in slow motion and it looks even more ridiculous...... But there are still people with no brains that think it looks awesome 🙄 also I&#39;m not a climber but surely they wouldn&#39;t just go up with hardly any space between them and without placing anchor points or whatever...... No wonder her first climb fucked up and someone got killed...... I hope they both die
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaNo<br><br><br><br><br>Yes
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaДэнчик Слазиет: The Movie 🤣🤣🤣
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshita😨🙏watching this trailer gives chills down my whole legs because of my Acrophobia condition🙏😨
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWow , I don&#39;t believe that the phone did not work, TMobile and A&amp;tt has good nationwide coverage
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song called from 1.06
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWomen eh? forgot to pack everything but the chutes xD
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be hilarious.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaFrom the producers of 47 Meters Down comes....47 Meters Up
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhite ppl doing dumb shit again in the middle of nowhere🤦🏾‍♂️😂. Let&#39;s see where this story goes. 🤷🏾‍♂️
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaBro does anybody know the beginning song I literally cannot find it I’ve been looking for it everywhere
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThrilled
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaOk but does anyone know the name of the song I got most of the lyrics from the trailer and still can&#39;t find the song 😤 here are the lyrics: &quot;tell you again cutting my ties cutting my losses ...remember how you said you would save me but your the only one that needed saving you said that i would struggle to survive but i&#39;ve never felt more alive.&quot;
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaNot having signal? On that height? On the very top of antenna? Really?
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIs this Negan&#39;s past or future?
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshita🤙!
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS TRAILER SONG?
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitawould have been better in Imax format with vertical film.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaOooh ooooouh oooohh it&#39;s terrible 😶😶
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaanother climbing film made by someone who doesn&#39;t really know anything about climbing 🙄
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaMy heartrate was going just from the trailer
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s say that they had the foresight to pack in light parachutes, how likely is that they survive a jump?<br><br>The tower is supposedly 2000ft tall
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIf they start lezzing out, just role with it :P
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis would a good IMAX film
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is gonna give me fast heartbeats!
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaJeffery Dean Morgan got me. Will put this on my must watch list. Looks like a good thriller.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Good thing we brought these lightweight parachutes with us, this could have gone REALLY wrong&quot;<br><br>roll credits.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaFemale lead characters 🤣🤣😂😂😂
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhy would they have no signal 2000 feet up??
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaGeez just watching this trailer gives me that awful feeling in my midsection like when I played those &quot;in the air&quot; levels in Super Mario.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks dope
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaFuck No: The Movie
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaI need this song like right now 😫 Madison is amazing.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIdiots: The Movie
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaI love this kind of movies with &quot;minimalistic&quot; fucked up situations. This is gonna be AWESOME!!! 🤙🏻🐦
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaSo stupid lol
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshita&quot;So we&#39;ve done stuck in a cage with sharks around and trapped in a system of underwater caves with sharks around, now what&quot;<br><br>&quot;What if they climb a tower and get stuck&quot;<br><br>&quot;And there&#39;s sharks that live in the clouds?&quot;
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaSo Hyped 😍🔥👏
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaoh I will be seated! i missed movies like this in the cinema 🍿
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitathis movie is like saw meets 40 meters down or a sequel to 40 meeters down call 40 meeters up
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaUau 🙏🕊🦅❤📚🌌
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaDid no one learn from 127 hrs 🤦‍♂️<br><br>&quot;Oh no! We&#39;re trapped!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s a good thing I told someone else where we were going and if we weren&#39;t back in the next 24hrs to call the police!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You did?! That great!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep! All we&#39;ve got to do is wait and when we don&#39;t get in contact in the next few hours, they&#39;ll call for help.&quot;<br><br>&quot; You&#39;re amazing!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know 😏&quot;<br><br>End Credits.........
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaOooooh sweaty palms on this one for sure 🖐
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIf they don&#39;t use the Eels song Friendly Ghost in this movie I want my hypothetical money back.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this ? <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSspRSGc4Dk&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a>

iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaAs a Telecommunications Technician, this looks awesome !!
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaI find no point in this movie whatsoever.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaAs someone who is terrified of heights....this looks awesome...and is a perfect horror movie for me. Also, gotta love the JDM is in the film, although, his part seems small, telling by the trailer. But, the movie looks pretty good. EDIT: I saw that it isn&#39;t horror....it will still be one for me, lol
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaTeaser of this movie made me sick.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaOMG this movie looks Awesone!  The cgi is súper Good. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ I need watch this
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaWow Just Gossebumbs even it&#39;s not Horror.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaAs a hardcore walking dead and JDM fan , I might just see this movie for him. If he has a bigger role otherwise maybe
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitawhy wouldn&#39;t you tell someone that you&#39;ll be going out there
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaCliffhanger 2
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaTbh, Hollywood makes the best survival movies
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaBut why would three people be climbing all at the same time on a multi pitch?💀
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaNo thanks looks terrible.
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaIs it normal for my hands to sweat when watching a trailer? 😅
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaAwe heeeeeeelllll nooooooo
iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaOk finally that cgi is better, that teaser made me wheeze

iSspRSGc4DkdelimeterByIshitaFirst comment
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not a Romcom guy but this was a pretty cute movie. I can relate to Wallace A LOT.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaScared, Potter?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t she his girlfriend ❤️❤️❤️❤️
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaToo bad the trailer is awful. The movie was really good.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaPersonally, I love this movie. It’s really different from most rom-coms, in my opinion, but the trailer does give most of it away, unfortunately.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis movie was funny and charming. It was adorable in a way, lol
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaแดเนียล แรดคลิฟฟ์<br>30/5/60
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaHARRY LOOKS SO CUTE! (i just cant call him Daniel im sorry lol)

frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitakylo ren what the hell are you doing with those nachos?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaLove. Love. Love. LOVE!! The movie was wonderful! Great Job!!! :)
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaRuby Sparks again
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaok , i m not the kind of guy that like just action, violent movie, with a cherry of horror on the top, i can see stuff more like the everyday life, comedy or even not really a comedy. honestly i could not go to the end of that movie, i feel sorry for those that pay a quid or more to watch it at cinema, hope they have a nice gf to kiss during the projection. it s like a comedy without the fun, it s exactly like waiting for a bus on a strike days ,it was just boring really, a pathetic version of  &quot; just friend&quot; trying to be more serious, but loosing the fun, hope it doesn t pretend to be a comedy; the guy that used to be harry potter well he should stay harry potter, cause he just don t seems to be an actor at all, he look just funny, ok i can handle all kind of movie, weird, horror, life, but those so called romance analisys going nowhere i just can stand it it s patronizing and pretentious, when american try to be intellectual ity s pathetic... they are good for action movie , and we french are suck for action movie , so let s make a deal , don t try to think and we won t try to do action okay?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaLmao, the whole movie was just condensed in a 3 minute trailer. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaNo more Harry Potter boy. He is grown up but not quite grown.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaOh......its perfect and enjoyable.....loved it♡♥:-):-):-):-)
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s not his room mate - fail<br>The speech was about himself and how happy he was for his friends wedding- fail<br>I&#39;m leaving to x place bla bla bla is a job opportunity that she didn&#39;t want to take because she doesn&#39;t feel ready - fail. So moral of the story is, don&#39;t judge a movie by it&#39;s trailer. The movie is not cliche as you may have thought of. It&#39;s actually very sweet
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThe other dude is like 6 ft 10 tall hahaha
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaOh yes the fiftieth movie about how guys and girls can&#39;t be friends. Perfect. <br>/sarcasm
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitasong name please
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or is it difficult for anyone else to see Radcliffe as anything other than Harry Potter?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaMovie about stealing a girl from another guy &amp; escaping the FriendZone... nice
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaamezing
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaHARRY POTTER WHAT WOULD GINNY SAY IF SHE SAW THIS!?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitashame on you .... cheating on Hermione Granger, oh i see how it Harry Potter
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitadam I&#39;d see this if my schedule wasn&#39;t backed up
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaRadcliffe is playing a ST8 dude.  way hotter that Hobbit boy. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaHahaha Harry....
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaIn the end scene: is Daniel really that short?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s Harry Potter! (The only way I will ever see that actor)
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see What If in theaters so excited I love to watch the trailers it shows how funny it will be.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaDan: Heey!! GIVE MY WAND!!! fghjfjgjjgkdjf
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitahope it will be available in France !
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI agree completely with the first sentence of the trailer.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitawhere can I watch this movie? has it come out in the U.S.?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitahaha I love this trailer :) Excited to see it now :D
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaDaniel Radcliffe in a romantic comedy... I think I&#39;ve been waiting for that my whole life!!!!!!! Can&#39;t wait!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitawish I didnt see the fucking trailer. I was kinda curious about the movie and all, but wtf it shows all the plot points in the fucking movie! fuck this shit! pirating this all the way!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaRename: &#39;Generic Date Movie&#39;
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the song in trailer, anyone?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaGuess this is one of those give away 99% of the movie trailers. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaomg ruby sparks
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWell, I don&#39;t need to watch the movie any more after seeing this trailer
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaAdoooooooooooooooooro
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaLOL, yeah right
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWoooow Daniel I Love You &lt;3
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaHUMMM.... Já amei só de ver o trailer e o Daniel!!!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the songs in the trailer? Thanks. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m a 2&quot; omg, and when he fell out the window..and &quot;I just had sex. I&#39;m about to eat NACHOS!&quot;
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s &quot;Ruby Sparks&quot; right? 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis can go under the list of films whose trailers show the entire movie without people having to go and pay to see it.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaall I heard is &quot;I was offered a job in Taiwan&quot;- Hey Taiwan, I want a job <b>waits</b>. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI wanna know who makes these awful trailers -.- why is it freaking 3 mins? I&#39;m sure all the good scenes are in it.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis look soooo good. I cannot wait!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI live for these kind of cheese and fluff. Can&#39;t wait for this movie!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song playing in the beginning of the trailer?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI think that Adam Driver guy has a role in the new Star Wars Film
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWhat if the trailer has already told me the whole story? -.-
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThe songs are &#39;Big Talk&#39; by Conway and &#39;Never One To Complain&#39; by Night Terrors of 1927
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI just saw the entire movie in this one fricken trailer
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaWhats the other songs in it !! not the song at the end but just before it !!<br>OMG plz someone tell me !!<br>And though the trailer tells everything !! I still wanna see it ...it looks amazing !!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaoh Daniel :&#39;) 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI thought people stopped making trailers that show the entire film?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaShe got offered a job in Thailand? Of course she did, is he an architect too? -.- It actually looks quite good though, even if a little cliche. Definitely won&#39;t be going to the cinema to see it, but would like to see it at some point :P
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaSad because it&#39;s awfully predictable, but i like this kind of movie because it helps some actors to start acting in better and more complex filmes. Will watch for this little artists and Daniel Radcliffe :)
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI love that Dan&#39;s pretty much doing stuff from every genre &lt;3 he&#39;s so talented!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI fell like i just watched the whole movie.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaDan and Zoe look really cute together.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshita what&#39;s the song playing??² 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshita99% would be a lit bit too much...
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI wanted to see it, but now that I&#39;ve seen the entire story in the trailer, I don&#39;t know anymore
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI WANT TO SEE THIS SO  BADDD
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis seems like one of those trailers that give way too much away 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song playing??
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaawesome
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis looks soooo good.. Having been a fan of 500 days of summer, I am looking ahead to this one.. :) Go Go Daniel!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaOMFG. i saw cn tower freaked out. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaFriendzone. The movie.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaDo NOT watch this trailer if you don&#39;t want to be spoiled for the whole movie. You may watch until <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frvkyNg3nIo&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a>. Then stop. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite movie already. 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaFinally!! Woohoo!!!<br>* wasn&#39;t the movie called the f word in the film festivals?
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really excited for this movie! it looks great
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaSOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOL! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshita♥
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI can not wait for this movie! I&#39;m kinda getting an About Time and (500) Days of Summer vibe from it, if it is any where as good as those two movies I&#39;ll be beyond happy 
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitalooks cool
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome! Daniel in a romantic comedy? It&#39;s a dream come true! :))
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this movie !
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaThe movie about getting out of the Friend Zone. Lovely xD
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaDan is a really good actor i like this movie and i want see that!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song at the end?It is lovely!
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI love that they let him be english rather than having an american accent ugh love it
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this one. It looks charming yet seems to have an underlying logic that actually makes it a plausible rom com. Really. Can&#39;t wait.
frvkyNg3nIodelimeterByIshitaGinny Weasley will be so pissed when she sees this.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaOh my God this is even better than ocean&#39;s 11 so beautiful movie

so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitathaks for 700 million
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaany thing thicker than 5 inches dude
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaespecially when it comes to landlord go its back again
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaanother 10 million to go
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is better than 11 and 12 👏👏👏👏👏
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaThe heart of them?..Top guys all being Steve McQueen...Coolness at 125%.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so9Eh-Guci8&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a> Matt&#39;s fake nose👃 stole the show for me. Hilarious guy 😂
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaShown in: <br>Night at the Museum <br>Letters from Iwo Jima <br>Breach<br>300<br>Blades Of Glory<br>Gary Thurman and the 3rd Dimension <br>Pirates of the Caribbean: at World&#39;s End
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaWhy is there no comments lol
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitadanny chases rusty, rusty chases bank, abigail chases linus, basher chases turk and virgil both, terry chases all above, saul runs and returns for chasin frank, at the very end françois who didnt know he was chasin any1, discoveres he follows dell, bruiser and gerard, all three, wtf....? must admit havent seen bigger shjt in a long time...
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitais that juans dad?<br>yes
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaTHİS IS WORST ONE OF THE SERİES.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaPur classic.. Pure Gold..❤️❤️❤️
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaBest hiest movie never seam
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaHello 👋
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaWhen Bollywood was making romantic movies that time Hollywood created best movies as compared to 2021
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaGeorge Clooney’s name should appear next to the word “debonair”
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaMe watching this trailer like I haven’t watched the movie a billion times 😅
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitathis trilogy is pure gold
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaBut what are the odds ..Of getting even ..🔥✨
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so9Eh-Guci8&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> I think I like Al Pacino more than I like George Clooney.  Al isn&#39;t half as smug and self-regarding as George.  George is a bit too full of himself if he thinks everyone likes him over Al.  <br><br>In real life, no one, outside of la la land, likes a preening, narcissistic, self-satisfied pretty boy.  They prefer regular joes like Al.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Tess in this movie
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaMy fave ocean movie
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaIdk why there like no comments but what’s good y’all

so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so9Eh-Guci8&amp;t=0m28s">0:28</a> 😂 poor guy
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaSo i just came here to know the review of people on this movie but nevermind.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitathe women can have their &quot;Oprah&quot; joke in this classic without ruining a franchise and stuffing females into every role, like in Ocean&#39;s 8... which nobody likes.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaHow can there be no comments
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshita.HIIUUUUUUUUUU.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitaWhat an amazing movie.
so9Eh-Guci8delimeterByIshitahi whoever saying wow no comments and looking at that one guys comment :D
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaFinally found this movie again, remember watching it when I was younger and not knowing if I made it up or not bc no one knew what I was talking about
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0LiSIJIDgU&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> LMAO, ya think? 😂
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0LiSIJIDgU&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a> I can imagine the title saying: From the director of Guardians of the galaxy, The suicide squad and Peacemaker.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaThe garage scene traumatized me as a kid that was the only thing I could ever remember about this movie so I can never figure out the name of it but now I know it
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaIt is essential to have a sequel to this movie according to the credit scene of this movie. Please make the second part of the movie Slither.<br>🙏🙏🙏🙏
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaPam Beesly 😭❤️
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of that old movie night of the creeps..
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaFor the longest time I thought this movie was a fever dream. I was sadly mistaken.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaSOOO copy the night of the creeps lol nice and not better then any of the film&#39;s listed in the begging this move is garbage
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaw3r 43ewrw3r w3rwar
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita3wr w43rw3 r
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitawa3r3wr 3wr
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaThis excellent cult movie is one of the best 10&#39;s horror movies!
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita🔥 <br> Gift Idea!!! Seriously, love this movie. <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0LiSIJIDgU&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> 💙🎥💘 <br>  👇💖
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita🔥🔥🔥🔥 <br> This was a work of art from Mendes! <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0LiSIJIDgU&amp;t=0m51s">0:51</a> 💯💚❤ <br>  👇 👇 👇💘
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita🤢
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshita🤢 oh my god ahh!
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer reminds me Planet Terror
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaReally rude to just call all those other horror movies sissies compared to this.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaand hell raiser 1 to 8
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitathis is my favorite in my child hood so very very wow this movie
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaMichael Rooker a.k.a Merle, Nathan Fillion a.k.a Buck from Halo 3: ODST... sold
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaNight of the Creeps rules. But this movie is an awesome homage to a lot of classic horror.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaSomethings wrong with me lol
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaIt totally is, dude.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaguy that made this is making the new MARVEL movie.
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaDumbest movie ever
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitamerle! :D
b0LiSIJIDgUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer looks funny, but I found the movie quite boring. The soap opera style subplot about middle aged small town folks ruins it for me.

If you like the slug action, watch &quot;Night of the creeps&quot; from 1986, it&#39;s much more entertaining.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaWhat the hell did he say at 0:33? &quot;Ed sticks fengross&quot;?
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@johnhamilton08 I think that&#39;s what their goal was.

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@0309cindyhi Right Round by Florida 
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaIt was a little too much for me... Gerard is hot. But this still didn&#39;t make up for his character in this movie. Wasn&#39;t very attracted to him for most of the movie.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita&quot;SHUT UP, KATHERINE HEIGL! YA STUPID LIAR!&quot;
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;ve gotta be two people.
The Librarian...
and The Stripper....
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitalove Eric Winter 
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaOkay look I&#39;m a guy who can enjoy Romantic Comedies but this film I&#39;m sorry but this film one of the most sexist movies I&#39;ve ever seen.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaNo Problems.... Only Solutions :)
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitamore like &quot;The ugly stereotype&quot;... 
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitalove this!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitamy all time favorite movie---not only is it funny, but it really called me out of a relationship i was in---just like abby and collin. THE MOVIE IS A SAVIOR.!!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaright round aww i fin love this song so much

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaI love the part how I watched this trailer cause of the soul eater spoof of the trailer xD
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@principessaromana True, true!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai wonder if in the movie he says THIS IS SPARTA!!!!!!!!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@Totto87 well that is what makes his charm 
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaGerard Butler e un anima famosa, bella e piena di attrazione!!!! I said that Gerard has a famous, beautiful and attractive soul. Wsh my husband would come with me to Scotland, i always wanted to do, because i go crazy for accents, wether it`s an accent from london, england, scotland, australia, ireland, oh my! Wel i guess i have to satisfy myself by listening to it on tv. Allora Gerard auguri nela tua vita sei un attore superbo. 
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not Butler if he isn&#39;t stretching his jaw to the limit.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita&quot;could you stop doing that&quot;
&quot;why its turning you on?&quot;
&quot;ahh!maybe&quot;
&quot; i thing i kinda like it&quot;
&quot;really?&quot;
&quot;sucker&quot;
&quot; i know it!&quot;
LOL...The Ugly Truth is awasome!
Gerard is freaky hot~with the capital H!
smokin&#39; hot!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai give it a C
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaomg i thought the other guy was zac efron

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitagerard &lt;3
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita22 people couldn&#39;t handle the truth
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@mikicahadd haha, guess what? i live in scotland. you jealous?
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaThey should have included the the vibrating brief scene in this trailer.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaI can relate...
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaAbby: Why do you love me?
Mike: Beats the shit out of me

ive used that line 3 times when a girl has asked what I like about her. Hasn&#39;t worked yet but when it does, I know I found the right girl.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaamazing movie !! the leading actors are hot and funny!! perfect combination!

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitalooks like funny movie i&#39;m gonna see it
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaI love how a move claiming to completely understand men was written entirely by women and it shows. This film settles the argument once and for all: sexism works both ways.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita@xXalaniHeartz09Xx he surely is
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaomg this movie is HILAIROUS warning if ur a kid DONT see it with ur parents its really awkward

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t HE the phantom? O_o
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitasurprisingly funny movie. A romantic comedy not just for Girls.

DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaPoor kids.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaWTF???????
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaamarna007, it is Flo Rida, and the song is Right Round
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai watched it yesterday in cinema. it was great!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitafor sparta!!!!!!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaRight Round
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaso according to this trailer, a guy sexually harasses his female coworker, and she doesn&#39;t like it. and then after a while of dirty talk they become best friends? and probably hook up in the end? sounds lame.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai&#39;m sooooo going to watch that!!!!:D
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshita300
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai seen this movie twice in the theater and it was even better the second time. Butler did an awesome job, he was hilarious!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitathis movie was so good! i loved it i would soooo see it again and again =D!
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitawhat a bunch of junk. hollywood is trying but falling flat.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitai hate that song.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaSomething annoying about this chick
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaby the way, i love herrrrr since Roswell *-* omg
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaPERFECT, i want to see itttt now =)
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaLiteral lol-inducing moment at 1:37...  She just puffs up her chest randomly. XD
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitathis movie looks kinda fun. definitely a must see.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaumm me ! :D
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaYes, yes it is...
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaYes and this is him going down the same road Jason Statem (sp?) went down. He&#39;ll do a crappy movie (Celluar for Jason) and then bounce back with another crappy one and probably rub back to Guy Ritchie for another mob movie.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaI can see it being really hard for him to do the American voice well, but I can honestly say he&#39;s a good actor probably in serious movies, but a romantic comedy is not his bag of tea.
DvsZtGxsvV0delimeterByIshitaIs this guy screamed &quot;We are Sparta-a !&quot; ?

_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitathe THX and Equilibrium vibe is real.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaand THIS feminists is why the world SHOULD NOT be EQUAL
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaHow the fuck does this emotionless girl keep getting new movie roles...?!?!?!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaBased off of George Orwell&#39;s 1984. I&#39;m quite excited about this movie, the book is a must read!!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAnthem by Ayn Rand?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshita真666
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaEqually awkward.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitais it a love movie or what???? im confused
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThe Island - clones + horny teens
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThey got the girl without emotion to play the only person with emotion in the movie: brilliant
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAURORAAAAAAAAA
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAurora &lt;3
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaHonestly I give ZERO shits about The Island and THX-1138 and all those movies you mention.I&#39;m here because I wanna see THIS movie, and I don&#39;t fucking care if it looks like this and that, stop fucking labeling stuff. Is getting boring.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAurora&#39;s song for this trailer is soooo beautifull ;_;
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else find it ironic that in a world with no emotion; Kristen Steward is the one only person that has them?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThe Beast
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaFinally the perfect role for Kristen Stewart; a girl with no emotions nor expressions
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaEmotions have been eradicated and they cast Stewart. I&#39;ll just sit back and enjoy the joke.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaReminds me so much of Delirium by Lauren Oliver.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaJust liking it because of AURORA ♥♥♥
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaHow about an ACTUAL real world problem instead of this garbage, oh let&#39;s say like children being married off to middle aged men around the world. Now THAT is a terrible crime, and yet, these effin writers had to go up and make up an entire alternate universe in which there is some meager pathetic problem like this described in the movie when reality has far more terrible and complex problems that are very deserving of attention. <br><br>You choose between the stories of fantasies or the stories of the reality, of humanity, and you went with fantasy, pathetic.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaEveryone saying this looks like Equilibrium, The Island, and THX 1138 all of those have elements from a much older story as well: Anthem by Ayn Rand.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThis film is exactly the same as &quot;The Giver&quot;.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitawhats the song in the trailer?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaOh, 1984 for kids.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaSo Equilibrium just without the cool Gun Fu action.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaANYONE KNOWS WHAT IS THIS SONG IN THE END OF THE TRAILER/??!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAuroraaaa!!!!!!   :)
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitai just saw the entire movie... the trailer os giving away too much! go home A24 you&#39;re drunk...
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaFunny that there is a kind of love that is also almost a crime in our society and is not in the future.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaOh Great! Now there&#39;s a sci-fi Twilight, we will have to see Bella once again struggling to deliver a real facial expression
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshita&quot;reminds me of the THX 113, equilibrium, the island movies&quot; ok we get it. good job.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitareminds me The Giver universe
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThe most movie I&#39;m excited for! Seriously I can&#39;t wait !
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaSeems like THX 1138.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshita2 emotionless individuals finding love in an emotionless place? This looks like the movie Kristen Stewart was born to play.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAURORA YASSS
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they keep making these kinds of movies?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaD-503 and I-330
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitafinally perfect part for Kristen Stewart... &quot;with no emotions&quot;
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitasame thing as equilibrium but without action -.- and with stupid romance...
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this😍😍
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitai can´t wait  look´s amazing
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitathe island 2? 😻😻😻😻
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaTrack pls
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAURORA - Winter Bird brought me here, can&#39;t wait for the movie!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaI saw this back in September at the Toronto International Film Festival and LOVED it.  It&#39;s not for everyone, it&#39;s a very slow moving, dream-like film.  It&#39;s quiet and minimalist and very beautiful.  If you go into know that it&#39;s not some big action thing and know what to expect then you&#39;d probably like it.  I found the first trailer from 2 months ago does a better job portraying what the actual film is like rather than this one.  Can&#39;t wait to see it again, Nicholas Hoult is gorgeous in it.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of THX 1138.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaNicholas Hoult is a chameleon ! (in the good way of course)
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this movie
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaWow this looks fantastic 😀
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaAnother SF romance in a world where emotions are forbidden. After Lobster I&#39;m sick of it. And Doremus is totally not an acclaimed director. When he get some important award, then we will talk.

_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaBEAUTIFUL! CAN&#39;T WAIT!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaThe whole concept of a society without emotions has been explored in Equilibrium right?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaTHX-1138?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait omg 😭😭❤️❤️❤️ miss you Kristen
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaNero- Promises
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s a Sense Offender!
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaTHX 1138, GATTACA,The Island, Equilibrium not a single creative scene (dystopian rip off in every story detail, costume , setting even the fucking bug in the flask you really couldn&#39;t think of anything by yourselves)
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaWill it be released wide or in selected theaters on July 15?
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaKinda reminds me of The Island...
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s basically 1984.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaso so so beautiful
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitathe twillight gal bought Aurora&#39;s song

_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaoh I&#39;m in love w/Nicholas Hoult__ more and more
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaEquilibrium 2: Equals
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaI saw Kristen Stewart i was like: Uhm<br>I saw Nicolas Hoult i was like: hey !<br>I saw Guy Pearce i was like: HEY HEY ! :)

_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitaKristen Stewart resembles Riley Keough, grandchild of Elvis Presley.
_RTN3HnQV3cdelimeterByIshitafinally
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaugh. just had it play as white noise while I cleaned jy house  wasn&#39;t so funny ir original .I&#39;m also  in the minority who isn&#39;t a fan of  Hathaway  and her deer in the headlights stare..and always playing the oh so sweet goodie goodie ..against an  &quot;evil/mean girl &quot; ..In this version the &quot;mean &quot; girl.js so much better than her way more interesting..well until the stupid &quot;war&quot;. Hathaway character is  an  annoyingly boring tired character .Akao jm bemused how she&#39;s with someone q0 or 5 or even 3 years and doesn&#39;t realize how much they&#39;ve drifted until tens of thousands of dollars been wasted and they&#39;re at the alter    so bloody stupid on both their parts. This is also why I find d it idiotic spending lots of  money on a 12 hour day aka  wedding.  Eloping or  a tiny garden or beach one is  perfect .Mak a big party for everyone to celebrate it after if you must havebut .plus bugger to a band and an album.  Fav music in rotation and a couple of portraits all one needs. Yes <a href="http://im.in/">Im.in</a> the minority. We dobt have to agree.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshita❤ this movie!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of <i>13 Going on 30</i>
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThere needs to be a remake where they are mothers that have daughters and then they “fight” over the last place at a prestigious, private school or something haha; it’d be so funny. The little girls could be the ones that get their moms to work it out eventually and get them to send them both to regular public school.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitawell, my relationship with my ex best friend was like that , but is more hard to fix your problems in real life than the movies when a person don&#39;t think your wants.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaAt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBDE4uznmIw&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> the this is a deleted take. The line heard in the movie is &quot;he probably SAID&quot;. Here she says &quot;He probably THOUGHT.&quot; And you can even catch Anne Hathaway laughing and breaking character. 🧐😂
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshita....
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaYour wedding can DX!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣degeneration X
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was funny...2 great actresses❤❤
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaMy 15 month old will literally watch this every single day and it&#39;s been that way for like a month. One night I put this on and realized that this kid, who doesn&#39;t even sit through a whole cocomelon song, sat through and watched half the movie until she fell asleep. So now I put it on a lot around bed time. It calms her down and she will watch the whole thing if she doesn&#39;t fall asleep lol, it&#39;s the weirdest thing...
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is there a different scenes in a trailer and the real movie!! I dont get it !!??!!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so good one of my favorites
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaHow interesting that this trailer includes so many deleted scenes and that about 90% of it is compiled of takes that weren’t used in the film
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaSome parts are not shown in Netflix
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaOmg this is 13 years ago
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThe wedding planner should have just made the executive call and made the third bride move and share a date with Liv instead of pulling the rug out from under everyone.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaBride Wars is NOT a bad film!!!! It has the worst reviews of any movie I’ve ever seen but I’m sorry Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson …. In a wedding movie !!! Heaven !!! The reviews make me angry this movie is so special to me
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaShown in:<br>Twilight <br>Australia <br>Nothing Like The Holidays<br>Marley &amp; Me
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBDE4uznmIw&amp;t=0m13s">0:13</a> fun fact: if you look to the left of the screen, you can see my mom.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaJust got this recommended on 2021
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshita😂 this movie was awesome I need to rewatch it
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaFletcher = Worst bf in the world!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI can relate to this movie 🍿😂 It’s much too different from the reality.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI can’t believe it. This song is on Tik Tok 😳
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWatching it now. Don&#39;t understand what the issue is. They gave the planner their dates. So the planner would have given the third bride the last available slot. So even if the assistant got the names the wrong way round the third bride would have been none the wiser. 😳
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaCool le film
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaAlways one of my favourite movie..... never gets old
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie I went to see it when I was pregnant and my baby was born June 27 Emma wedding date
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaCrazy that 11 years ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBDE4uznmIw&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a> is an insult and now days that’s a compliment 🤣
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitathis is a great fun movie with a great cast too
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaStar lord and Cat Woman were engaged and married, but they broke up and Star lord falls in love with Gamora and Cat woman falls in love with Batman
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaGarbage friends
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitano never nevereverevereverever
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is awful. It&#39;s the most cliche, predictable, unfunny and cringeworthy thing I watched in a while
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaMouldy hair is in these days 😂😂
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaSuch a good movie with a great cast!❤
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaAw one of my fav movies❤️
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaGood movie
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the epitome of a romantic comedy fluff film you want to just put on when you’re wanting to zone out and play on your phone
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI love Kate Hudson she&#39;s so... like &quot;how to lose a guy in 10 days&quot; , &quot;fool&#39;s gold&quot;, &quot;almoust famous&quot;, &quot;raising helen&quot; ❤❤❤
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaNunca he visto el momento <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBDE4uznmIw&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> en la pelicula
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI used to watch this when i was in high school lol.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaStar lord and the cat women in a romantic comedy
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie, it&#39;s like my guilty pleasure
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBDE4uznmIw&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> its BLUUUUUUE!!!!!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaShould I watch this movie or not
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaSeeing a man changing Kate Hudson’s hair blue which is not meant to be, it’s supposed to be the color she wants at the place where makes my brother want to tickle Kate Hudson especially in the feet!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaoh... I thought they both married the same bride...awkward .-.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s so straight
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s Jake from oth...omg everything&#39;s is so connected
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWhat an underrated movie! MUST WATCH THIS.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is Kate Hudson the most annoying person alive in every movie she’s in?  Overrated.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaChris Pratt is in this movie😂
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaloveeeeeeeee
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaIn last Emma Marries livs brother
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWhy would they show the whole movie in a trailer???
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaseems like a stupid premise
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThe Asian version for this is just as awesome
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaIf you watched the whole trailer then you&#39;ve just watched the whole movie.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWhat music was used in the mid way of the trailer?
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaJust saw it in E! Network. Completely entertained!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaAnnoying looking movie trailer
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaLol
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaone of my all time favourite movies... love it!!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaOoh😀
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaWorst....Movie.....Ever.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaDo not watch the trailer it&#39;s basically the whole movie, gives away everything
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaOMG MARCUS AND DARCY
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is AMAZING
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI love anne hathway
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaGo and watch Mark Kermode destroy this! So funny.
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaluv this movie
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitahow come? 
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes me absolutely despise women. 
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaanne hathway anne hathway will win bride wars.

KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitabut her hair does look nice!! lol
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one thinking: Double Wedding?
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh. Both actresses are AWESOME!
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitathe end was sweet... =)
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaI wonder why beautiful and talented Anne Hathaway agreed being in this crappy movie. This film is Kate Hudson&#39;s level (typical useless comedy trash) but not Hathaway&#39;s. Anne deserves much better films
KBDE4uznmIwdelimeterByIshitaThis is not good enough to be on my tube.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaBe strong like Brad Pitt
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI still have no idea what this is about O.o
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks boring. i can&#39;t see how this is going to be good if i think a lot of people will fall asleep watching it
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaporca puttana quanto ti sto aspettando
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitathis looks liek it could be incredible, definately looks like the best of this year so far.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThe cinematography looks really good. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaDis movie is gonna be so badaass!!!!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Unless you love, your life will flash by.&quot;


so powerful. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaBenjamin Button 2? Cause the first one was such a great movie......NOT!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI settle down and sit back to see my own feet. I compared my feet to the baby feet in the film. The was much difference, and yeah I admit that I haven&#39;t been noticing about the changes of the pattern on my feet for so long. This film make me wanna go back to the past and see how I was grown up, and I thumbs up for terrence&#39;s masterpiece of this film.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita&quot;no description available&quot;

Couldn&#39;t have put it better myself.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaHow can you judge the movie before it is even out public?  

But IT does look good!!!!!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@bicsage1717 You mean, with all the hokey Shyamalan twists? No, I hope this doesn&#39;t bring it like the Black Swan. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking of this trailer after seeing it before Black Swan, which I thought was okay. Kind of poor work for Aronofsky. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@bicsage1717 

May be better no comparing these

but!!!  in the end any of us has to choose which way......crossroads are at any point of the way
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a Terrence Malick movie so every single shot is like a work of art.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Someday we will fall down and understand it all.....all things.&quot; That was a very moving quote.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Always you wrestle inside me. Always you will.&quot;
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI thought was dragonball z. Wrong on i guess

RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaIf the movie will be awesome or not I don´t know. But the trailer is one of the most brilliant and touching I ever seen.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaIt looks great, however, I defy anyone with a modern attention span to sit through any of Terrence Malick&#39;s films.  The &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; came out in 1998.  It&#39;s a war picture, right?  Even back then I watched most of it on fast forward.   Malick makes beautiful pictures but he has yet to understand the meaning of drama and pace.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita“Someday we’ll fall down and weep. And we’ll understand it all. All things.”
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaSongs used in trailer....

“Ma Vlast Moldau” by Bedrich Smetana
“Funeral March” by Patrick Cassidy

RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaIf you like the music in the trailer, we have the full orchestral version of Smetana&#39;s Ma Vlast Moldau on our channel.  And on January 4th, we will offer it as a free download for 1 day. Visit our channel and Facebook page for details.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@Sanjjeev21 Smetana Die Moldau is what it&#39;s called....
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaHeath ledger was supposed to have brad pitt&#39;s part in this.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@Two7Clips apparently not.. but i guess you do since to responded? lmfao
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI kind of like the vagueness of this trailer, since it has me curious enough to maybe even see the movie. At the same time though, the fact that it reveals nothing makes me want to save my money and wait for a review...
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaTERRENCE MALICK!!!!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitawhat?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaterrence malick is gr8.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI have a &quot;The Fountain&quot; vibe going on here. I like it.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI dont understand??
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaHaha reminds me of Fight Club when Brad says &quot;Come on son, hit me.&quot; xD
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@kanazawagil i just started on &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. The movie is...beyond description so far.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@roloug95 I just starting watching &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; on Netflix...I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but so far it defies expectations.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@ToLiveXisXToDie  hahahahahaha thats exactly what i was reminded of when watching this
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaNature and landscape seems to be a theme of Malick and it looks like this is no exception.  Loved The Thin Red Line and Days of Heaven was pretty good too.  Looking forward to it.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita1:40 rippoff from kingdom hearts
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me a lot of The Thin Red Line, which was also directed by Terrence Mallick. And that&#39;s a good thing.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@Lgg130 no, that was a compliment. im pretty positive that its gonna get a lot of recognition in 2012. sean penn and brad pitt are two of my favorite actors. and the movie just looks awesome. like something noone has ever seen before. so im counting on it! cheers!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@kawasakikx250ff i didn&#39;t think that way at first, instead I thought it was mercury but I guess it might be the sun&#39;s dying expansion in the final stage of it&#39;s life.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThis is probably going to be like a Donnie Darko type movie. It&#39;ll make sense when you watch the whole movie but will make you think about it for days.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@Danetto he purposefuly avoided oscar schedule so don&#39;t count on it... hollywood doesn&#39;t premiere much these kind of movies either. it&#39;s not worth that kind of attention so it&#39;s all good.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaLooks beautiful 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaWait...what?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaSome day, we&#39;ll fall down and weep. And we&#39;ll understand it all, all things.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaLooks really artsy.
I wonder if the script has any depth.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaDeep or meaningful movies are never gotten by idiots. Not many get &quot;Into the Wild&quot; yet theyd get Transformers 3D. Its the the way of the world or society.. Theres idiots and deep thinkers, doers and do notters.. 

Ignorance is bliss..

Intelligent people can normally never be happy. Therefore sometimes its goof to be dumb.. 
I wanna see this film.. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitauhm... OSCAR BUZZ?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@melbourneaussie28 They are not idiots, we&#39;re all the same. They just don&#39;t know better. Ignorance can be bliss too.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita&quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can..&quot;
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitalooks like *****
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitawats the last song
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure about the movie, but i do like the quote at the end
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaeh
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitalooks like a good movie to rent. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitabeutiful! lubeski looks better than ever!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaim so confused.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitai know im not gonna watch it.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good, definatley going to get nominated for the oscars
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitawow.. this looks amazing.. beautiful!!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaWUT?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt and Sean Penn star as father and son – their stories told decades apart, as Penn struggles with what led him to his present world. Terence Malick’s existential drama hits sometime in 2011.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThat was the most random comercial I have seen in a while. I thought we were done with these.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThat was intense. I got pretty hyped after seeing that. Man... There looks like there is definitely depth in this movie. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitathe cinematography is so good, it makes me forget that I have no idea what the movie is about, yet i still want to see the movie XD
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@rainonmebi i&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t!!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaYeah.. so this trailer doesnt reveal what the movie is about at all.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita0:47 Fight Club? 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t stop watching this trailer.  The shots are just amazing.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaC&#39;mon Son! I want you to HIT me as hard as you can!
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@armyofshadows I feel exactly the smae way about it. I love Terrence Malick&#39;s work, and everything about this trailer is captivating. I have very high hopes.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@Quetzacoatl2 
Yes, he is composing the music for this film....The second song in this trailer is thought to be one of his pieces for the movie.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThere is something very strong and moving about this trailer that I just know I want to watch the movie.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaWhen is it coming out
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitathe music is Bedrich Smetana - Ma Vlast Vltava thumbs so people stop asking

RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI see an Oscar potential in the future.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaI have absolutely no idea what this movie is about but I was completely hypnotized by the trailer, couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it. It&#39;s beautiful !
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita...

I take it that now is the time to start getting familiar with this &quot;Terrence Malick&quot;? If so, where should I start?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@zalasyu-- you&#39;re not supposed to, it&#39;s supposed to build your interest until you watch it yourself. that&#39;s how you know the movie has alot of work put into it that even the trailer is... intriguing...
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so amazingly beautiful...
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita@brandy1999 Bedrich Smetana - Ma Vlast Vltava
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitajizz in my pants
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaAnyone knows what the music is?
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t get the movie trailer
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThe cinematography looks stunningly breathtaking. Malick never disappoints. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks absolutely stunning. I am really looking forward to its release....By the way, does anyone know what the music is in this trailer? Both the second and the first song really intrigue me.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaGreat cinematography. Looks really interesting &amp; yes, the look youtube comments has changed. 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. Especially the cinematography. This may be off the subject, but is it me or does youtube comments changed? 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaOMFG!!!!! 
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaWow! This movie looks amazing! It was hard to get a feel for the movie based on the synopsis alone, but this really helps. I can&#39;t wait for this now. :)
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshitaThe movie doesn&#39;t look that great to my taste, I will wait for a second trailer to convince me.
RrAz1YLh8nYdelimeterByIshita# 1
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the music that plays from :56 until the end? I&#39;ve looked around, but I can&#39;t find the music for this particular trailer.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThis is such an amazing movie.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitat
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaFor once, a trailer that doesn&#39;t give away everything.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitahi...  what is the title of the song in this trailer...  plz
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitadas Märchen aller Märchen (German)
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitauhhhhhh........ I have no idea what was going on the intire time. can someone explain?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;d like to be young again. Is this film about medieval botox??
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitai thought it was an awful movie! the production is very good everything looks very nice but thats as far as it gets
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why this didn&#39;t have a cinema release.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshita@ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgHrzodTY&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> is all you need to see of this trailer......
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitayungsu
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitachick flik
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck is this shit?? Hollywood is definitely on crack!
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThey all look like they are inbred.   <br>weird small faces
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitacheenu Goswami
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitalove the soundtrack, nothing more.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitamadman I thought they just did anime
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just a bunch of classic Grimm Brother fairytales put into one movie.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitawhat.. did I just watch
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitawhat is going on? what is the plot?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaSo let me get this straight. The only 2 albio kids in the world, who are basically twins, can&#39;t hang out. That doesn&#39;t raise a brow to anyone in the kingdom?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaWhy haven&#39;t I heard anything about this movie lol? Fantasy and medieval and magic and eating bloody hearts at a table are totally up my alley. Is it already out or is it still like in the makings??
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaGame of thrones much is
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI just stumbled upon this trailer. I haven&#39;t seen any ads for this but the trailer is a year old? weird lol
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitathis movie has illuminati written all over it
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaDimostra che il fantasy in italia è una bella merda. <br>It&#39;s the prove that fantasy&#39;s in Italy is a shit. T.T
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why ppl think it&#39;s confusing, i mean it&#39;s obvious that it has multiple stories from how the title is, but i assume that they are all somehow connected!
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaWhy have I never heard of this before?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThe choosing of prince reminds me of the disney movie BRAVE
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaOh God, this movie made me so anxious... Especially with that girl being married off to that ugly ogre.....  but a good movie nevertheless.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshita...you lost me at hello 🤔
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitabunch ugly medievel white pll
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThat was a BIG dust mite!
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaWhy is there bits and pieces from Game of thrones season 7 trailer???????????????? &quot;The equilibrium of the world must be maintained,understand?&quot; Nope not at all !?!
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaso this is like the mixture off all the fairytales?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaso damn strange....but incredible movie :)
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI honestly thought this was a comedy or a parody of some sort.. Laughing the whole time! hahaha
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaIDK about you guys buy for me, the last scene was LOL.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaamé esa película
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaCaptilalising on Game of Thrones much?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaCame for the thumbnail,
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome! can&#39;t wait to see it
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m already confused
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaSo, there&#39;s a Tyrion, a rejuvenating Red Woman, weird Targaryen albino twins, what did I miss?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaTo those who didn&#39;t understand the movie and consider the trailer as a crap then this is not for you..
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most wonderful movie ever! artistic! every tale had great lessons to our real lives.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is not bad but when I watched it  with my friends we were so confused at what we see lol I&#39;m sorry to say this but this movie is a peace of shit....nothing makes sense here
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitano
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaSo... Is this The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen Part 2?
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitalooks brilliant!
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitalet me find out they r trying to copy game of thrones lol
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitacreepy..
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI clicked on this video because I saw ASS.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE WAS stupid... just stupid
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaconfusing but also intriguing.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes the movie epic but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a weird movie, not bad. For what it is - a very fairy tale - it works, but it&#39;s not epic.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea what this film is about the trailer is so confusing,  looks cool tho
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitawhat is the music from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgHrzodTY&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> and forward in this trailer? i love it :)
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThis was SUCH a brilliant film. Not for those who like simple straight-to-the-point movies, but for those who love movies with deeper meanings
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitawhat. the. heeeeeeellll
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitaThere was so much going on in this movie and I loved every bit of it! Excellent soundtrack and storyline. I hope the movie got the recognition it deserves and also profits. The costumes alone obviously took so much in the production. Kinda reminded me of my favorite movie - Pan&#39;s Labyrinth.
UvkgHrzodTYdelimeterByIshitamy number +923015823186

And when it got to the part that Leslie died, I was like &quot;What?&quot; and got teary-eyed like a kid. I like this movie. It&#39;s not Narnia but it caught me. :D

T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThis was probably the first movie that made me cry
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitatrailer should NOT reveal the plot, and thats why this is good trailer
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitawhats up with this movie? people say its good but this trailer looks like shit
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitasaddest film ever
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaMissleading trailer indeed!! You think its like a world of narnia where they go to another dimention xD but NOOO. its a storry about a bullied kid that FINALY gets a friend that makes him fell speciell and loved! Then they just kill her to make you cry for 20 min! So not a kids movie :O
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was great, the trailer didnt match at all though
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaOMG I cried like a baby watching this movie  
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThey should make a second one where she actually survived 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaSo I haven&#39;t seen this since I was like ten and I was on insta and I saw a pic of them and I was like wow so I watched the movie and I remembered why I didn&#39;t watch it again because I&#39;ve never cried so hard😭😭😭😢
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaToo bad the girl had died in the ending.<br><br><br><br>Bridge to Terabithia
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s sad when lesly dies 😢
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaMan, this really is the most misleading trailer ever made.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaShould have been titled &quot;Bridge of Death&quot; if ya know wut I&#39;m sayin
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2TDSEG57hI&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a>
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI watched this is kinda sad but good
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI read the book
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshita+AquariusTheUnicorn, sorry I haven&#39;t really realized what I wrote. When I get all emotional, I may ruin some stuff. I deleted the comment and know more information. Watch the movie yourselves, peoples! I really do recommend this movie to people who like movies (I couldn&#39;t really explain, perhaps people who might like adventurous movies.)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitai love josh hutcherson!!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitastoners
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitacan some give me the link for the full movie to this?
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading the novel &amp; i guess this film is already in my list :)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI have watched this film loads and it was only the other day I found out that it was josh hutcherson playing Jess he looks nothing like peeta lol
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaPeeta :D This movie had my crying... too much... (omg he&#39;s just too cute for me to handle, sorry)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaVery misleading trailer, but this was the last movie I ever cried at for a very very long time (the one that broke me again was Saving Mr. Banks).
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThey were right, the trailer is really mean spirited.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThis is such a sad movie!!!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitawhat is the genre for this kind of movie? is it considered fairy tale?
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaHe was in this as well as The Hunger Games?!!  
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitanow that&#39;s a misleading trailer
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaWhy do I love this movie it tears my soul out every time I watch it
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaUsualy im not emotionaly but this movie realt tuch my feelengs :(<br>

T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaSome tragic love story. 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t watch this movie without crying... its so good but so sad :(
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaok, everyone. shut up about the trolls and all that not being in the book. This is all stuff that Leslie and Jess are IMAGINING. it&#39;s not all real, it is only in their heads, like the book.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitathe girl dies in the end
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaIn the book, they&#39;re TEN. Not teenagers!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaTHE FEELS DUD!!!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitathis trailer sucks but the movie was actually great. It&#39;s more like a love story to me 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a fun and adventure filled movie this won&#39;t be! Now excuse me while I cry in the corner
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaStupid movie had me crying for an hour straight!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaYeah um, our class just got done reading this book, and we&#39;re doing our book report tomorrow, I remember a poor boy meets a rich girl and they pretend about weird stuff and the girl dies, then the sister becomes queen, not giant walking trees, sword faries and things like that. good job Disney ;)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie of 2007
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaOMG Josh hutcherson looked do cute in that movie &lt;3
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitai love this film
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaRopeswing to Narnia
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaAw josh
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaPeeta?!?!?
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaHa valamelyik magyart beszélő ember nézi, ezt az előzetest.. akkor ne hogy bedőljetek.. mert a videó félre vezető.. (nagyon) q_q  Szóval nem egy Narnia utánzást kapunk vagy ilyesmi.. hanem egy Drámát :) :) Bár a trailer tetszik nekem.. de akkor és félrevezető q_q 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaUsed to LOVE this!
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThe annoying thing is, I don&#39;t like fantasy movies so when this trailer came out I thought, &quot;Not gonna watch it.&quot; But when I found out what it was REALLY like months ago, it sounds like the sort of story I WOULD have watched at that age. Drat.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaLeslie die in the end sadly
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitashe dies
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks nothing like the book 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaall time i see this movie, i cry too :&quot;(
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaToo bad Leslie died in the movie
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshita Brigde to Terabithia?<br>They should call it Bridge to Tearing my f*king soul.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else notice it said this winter then said febuary at the end 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaTOTALLY misleading trailer! This is how you don&#39;t make a trailer.. Give this movie a chance, disney messed it up (the trailer that is!) making it look like a Narnia/Golden Compass crap. The film is more akin to something like &quot;Its Kind of a Funny Story&quot;, &quot;Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot; etc. Though not as mature as those two but still such a well told and close to heart tale. I felt the boy&#39;s the life a little myself, as I have 3 sisters (2 older and 1 younger, just like the protagonist lol!) and I felt like I should make this opinion heard. Seriously, this is NOT a fantasy film and it couldn&#39;t be further from it. Give this movie a chance :)!﻿
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes me realize how lame and uninspired regular women are. And this world is so awful that we have to destroy even fictional characters like this.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaWow this is the misleading trailer ever.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this as a kid with my mom ( so much memories ).
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this film when I was about 10, brings back so much memory&#39;s, amazing film :)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is selling a completely different film from what the film actually is.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaAw little josh:)
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaterabithia..?? what district?
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks AWEWSOME.. But it&#39;s not.. It&#39;s actually boring.. Just a plain fantasy drama about friendship.. Don&#39;t expect it that way.. But it&#39;s really heart touching..
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaanyway i love this movie. even tough its not meet my expectation but its just worth to watch it. lovely friendship. Leslie is cute. 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitais . . .

T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitayeah but the best movie i saw
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaThis fucking movie was really depressing in a good way. Best movie ever that I watched in my entire life. It made me cry :(
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaHaving a friend like that is better than going out with gold digging dirty sluts.
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaSo sad
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaJosh will alway be Jess, AnnaSophia will always be Leslie
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaONLY ARTISTS AND OPPOSITE SEX FRIENDS RELATE TO THIS STORY.
and others can&#39;t 
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaI see this is one of those spoof trailers they do where they recut a movie to be something else. This is Bridge to Terabithia as a fantasy movie... yeah, it fooled me.  
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaOlga liked this haha, and josh is to beautiful to function
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitahmmmm.

T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaMisleading trailer... this movie is abt two kids on drugs..
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitakellykelly.wiliams@ymail.com ihate this bitch shit you have to watch pretty movies like me duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitaso true
T2TDSEG57hIdelimeterByIshitamisleading trailer
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaso you shake the camera to make it look less like big brother
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaJust watched triangle
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the best sci fi movie ever
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaShakey cam?....no thanks
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaCame after someone&#39;s comment on predestination.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaGreat film despite of having low budget. This really proves A LOT!!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaMindfuck as fuck! Brilliant Movie !
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitawho is here to read alike movie comments
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaEasily in my favorite movies of all time! This movie is one crazy smart weird scary ride in ways you&#39;d never really expect
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI know this is very off topic. But is there any movies that are similar to &quot;I still see you&quot;?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThe trailer doesn&#39;t do justice to the movie. I thought it&#39;s some psyco killer type movie but it wasn&#39;t.<br>It&#39;s a science fiction and great mind Bender.<br>I&#39;ll suggest everyone to watch it and then explain the ending lol
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAwesome movie, great trailer
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitawho&#39;s here because of 9gag?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshita9gag
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshita$50,000 dollar can do magic if the script is great. Shame on you mainstream Hollywood
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAny movies like this ?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaIf everyone take the sleeping pill while passing the comet. They stay in there own reality
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThe movie was good with a lot of suspense but the ending was so unsatisfying...<br><br>Perhaps I had higher expectations due to the comments?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaOne of the master minded screenplay and the best direction.! Time loop is explained very well like as scientist.. <br><br>Best movie of the best movies..
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t watch the trailer amigos
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t be fooled by the trailer. It&#39;s not a slasher horror film at all. It&#39;s actually very interesting. What a great surprise this film was.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAmazing must watch.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis film is saying very realistic and same time scary truths about the ourselves.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitamind blowing movie, sooooo underrated!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely mind-blown. What an amazingly brilliant, well done movie. I&#39;m recommending it everywhere.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWatching this movie rightaway, came to this comment section out of curiousity, dunnkow whats wrong wid me.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitahands down one of the best movie ever made !! EVER !!!!!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI cant take the movie seriously mainly because of Jonah hill acting for the role of Amir.<br><br>Oh wait... sorry, wrong universe.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaInteresting film.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI wish i can find other movie like this but i cant
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis movie proves that you can only love one special person in the entire multiverse!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI am writting this comment on 4 sep 4199.  Its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxAOewNzz-8&amp;t=11m45s">11:45</a> PM.  I live on Moon.  Its the only planet with life out of 30 planets ( There are arguments to have life on another planet named Earth..)... one more thing...i m writting this in my dream...
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaCoherence = One of the most boring films at all. Bla bla bla - family man dialogues with housewives - zero suspense - zero intelligence - zero action - all happens (whatever that should be) more or less in one room. Super low budget with no skills at all. Cheap actors especially the bitches obviously fucked with the producer to get the boring roles. You must have an extremely boring life to think this is a okay movie. Wasted time.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M HERE BECAUSE OF LANG LEAV&#39;S SAD GIRLS!! WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE? AHSHSHSHA
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s looks likes chitrabey Indian movie
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely mind-bending. Anyone know similar movies?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWtf mind blown A MUST WATCH
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaMandela effect on point
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaSPOILER ALERT<br>---------------------------- <br>PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE ONLY AT 10 AT NIGHT
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitathe most amazing movie!!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitathe worst movie ever. I regret for wasting 1 hour and half of my life on it.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaCan someone explain to me the conversation that em had with her man at the car, and he just froze and she walked away.. that was very confusing.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis still gives me goosebumps.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaVery similar to TRIANGLE
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s that song at the end of the trailer?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI never saw any movie with the same storyline with this one. Thumbs up.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshita&quot;there are different realities i slept with your wife in everyone of them&quot; best quote ever
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI gave this movie a shot and it was excellent. Definitely worth the watch. It captured my attention from beginning to end, especially the end. This movie reminded me of Triangle (another great movie).
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitai was about to write ive seen this trailer before it seems like a movie i have seen. now i realise this is the movie ive watched :D and back than i didnt even understand it but i enjoyed it anyway :D now i understand what is going on lel
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitajust watched this and WOW. So good and i got mind fucked so hard. LOVE IT
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaregret watching this
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a pinnacle of how you don&#39;t need expensive cameras and equipment and CGI to show Sci Fi. Briliant movie indeed. Loved it.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is simply complicated.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitareally good movie
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaOkay so the last comet that passed the earth was on september first 2017... And this in no joke but a lot has changed in my life since then... hahah I&#39;m saying this as a joke but what if it&#39;s true... lol idc actually goodbye old me
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaMy  score over this movie... 10/10... nothing else to say...
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI really wish they didn&#39;t always depict extremely young and &quot;hot and sexy&quot; women side by side with older, wrinkled men. Just once I&#39;d like to see it equal.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaHow is it possible that 2 emilys can be in one reality that is bullshit!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThese movie gave me goosebumps. Such a &#39;wow&#39; movie.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWhat if we didn&#39;t all watched the same movie? But like alternatives of the same movie..
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshita9gag
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer remind me of &quot;Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County&quot;.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaboring and too much irrelevant conversations , waste of time
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitafinished watching the movie and just came here to say: &quot;wooow&quot; such an amazing movie!!! loved it, i even got the chiken skin all over my arms at the end
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is brilliant for two reasons: <br>A. It&#39;s completely different and original<br>B. made at a budget of only 50 thousand dollars, just shows you even at cheap budget quality stuff can be made.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis was a really good mystery movie
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAfter watching this I suddenly realized if Stephen Hawking&#39;s worst case scenario eventuates &amp; aliens actually invade the Earth, All they have to do is wipe out all internet &amp; com systems &amp; we&#39;d (humans) be f*#&amp;@d
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaHey ! Does anybody know the name of the song at the end ?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAnybody know any other freaky movie like this?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWho else is here because of piinksparkles? 💋💋
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWhy is the plot so similar to +1&#39;s?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaIve heard good things about this movie, I&#39;m about 15 minutes in it right now and I just need to know...was the budget so low that they couldnt get a tripod or a person with a steady hand lol. And whats up with the zoom! Its just completely zoomed in on everyones faces... Its driving me crazy. Im not knocking the film, it seems good..just the camera man or whoever directed that it be filmed this way is killing it so bad... it looks like it was filmed with a cell phone. Tf.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t waste your time. This movie is not &quot;thought provoking&quot; or &quot;mind blowing&quot; as others may have claimed. Good concept but poorly executed. Acting was trash. The dialogue was exhausting. I would describe it like trying to listen to a seminar at a crowded bar. I wanted to yell at the actors to stfu! There is nothing intellectually challenging about this film. Don&#39;t get me started on the editing. Overall a good eye roller. I will give credit that the plot was somewhat original yet very predictable.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI recently watched this movie and I will says it&#39;s a hell of s movie you need to watch it
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI have just watched this movie and I would recommend everyone to check it out!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not too sure what this movie is about. But I tell you what, I&#39;ve seen enough movies to know that when shit gets weird, don&#39;t go outside.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaCrazy in this that Emily shows up to the party barefoot, as if it is in Fred Flintstone&#39;s time.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaGood movie but what happened to the Emily in the bathtub? That part confuses me.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why but for me this movie just sucked! Bad acting... too fast and unlogic dialogues... People don&#39;t talk so much in real life... Like not a single second pause when noone is talking! Annoying to watch!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaEXCELLENT MOVIE EVER SEEN.................. ANY OTHER MOVIE OF THIS KIND???
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaGreat movie! Anyone know any other movie similar?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThe best movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaawesome one isn&#39;t it... even si-fi movies were getting boring lately. a si-fi movie does n&#39;t make u scratch ur head is not a si-fi movie. any other movie u remember like this one plz tell. dont mention big budget movies, i&#39;ve seen them all, these low budget movies are the ones more illusive. and dont say &quot;man from earth&quot; already seen it 
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? IT &#39; S THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!! I LOST 89min OF MY LIFE FOR THIS SHIT!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAs an admitted sci-fi snob,, this will be in my top 5 list permanently! Any film that keeps you pondering/ debating scenarios and possible effects etc well after it&#39;s ended is a solid one. Although this would be considered low budget, the premise is completely new, a welcomed change of pace. So glad I took a chance and watched it!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song at the end?
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was dope af. Brilliant.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s no ending???
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitait&#39;s one of those amazing, thought-provoking, mind blowing movies that you MUST watch. just watch it. I rate it 5 stars
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaThe anthropic principle with a quantum twist. Simply brilliant! 
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaPLS CORRECT ME IF I&#39;M WRONG<br>SPOILER ALERT<br>I believe that in this last universe they are all the originals ones because they didn&#39;t leave the house and they didn&#39;t even know about the book ( it was still in the car at the end of the movie ) so the ones in the last universe had no idea what was going on, so my guess is that the Em who called was the one who got knocked out in the bathroom ( she probably didn&#39;t die) , so the ending suggests that the visitor Em ( the killer ) was busted .<br>The moral in my opinion is that we can&#39;t escape our reality ( existance and choose another no matter how hard we try ( Em tried to belong to the last Universe because she liekd it ( eveyone was happy and getting along) but she got busted.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWhite people trying to explore and shit. Just sit your ass down somewhere and wait out the night. 
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaMIND MIND MIND BLOWING MOVIE such an incredible story 
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaAt first I thought the movie was depicting multiple (not sure if infinite) realities converging on that one point in time and space due to the gravitational effects of the comet. However, because each reality seemed to exist in a different point in time, whether separated by minutes, as in the bang at the door, or microseconds, as in the moment when they saw themselves across the street, I think that it&#39;s the same situational reality replicated in past and future moments which would remedially explain why some events have already taken place and seem to repeat and overlap. (I can hardly understand what I just wrote since it&#39;s so difficult to explain.)<br>So, rather than there being other sets of themselves and others of the same house all existing at once, I sense there is just one set of people and one house but appearing to repeat due to the bending of time drawing all events, both future and past, of this situation to one point in time. I assume the house and the people at the beginning of the movie is the original copy, if you will, and that if they had stayed indoors, they wouldn&#39;t have set off the chain of skewed time effects creating past and future events of themselves and their reality.<br>It&#39;s mind-blowing to think that if I were in that situation and confronted another one (or two) of me, I wouldn&#39;t be so certain I could trust myself since all of me still have the same innate drive for self-preservation.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitacrazy movie.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaI literally just finished watching this. OH MY GOD, it&#39;s fucking brilliant. Such a smart movie, it&#39;s been a while.
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaGah, another horror movie. Boooooooring. I want challenging proper science fiction!
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaXander from Buffy the Vampire Slayer  :)
kxAOewNzz-8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song at the end of the trailer?
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how many will realize that this is what we are heading into and that all the plans of those on top of the pyramid are covered in this movie ( or most ) ... but to bad sheople just think it&#39;s a movie and nothing else ...
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWHY IS ALL THE RUM GONE!!!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitasomebody send arnold back in time! 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaLooks something great....i will watch this
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaHolly shit, that&#39;s AWESOME
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWow; this looks awesome! Taking The Matrix &amp; Terminator movies into consideration adds signifcance, for me, to this movie&#39;s plot. It kinda blends the worlds together...
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaanother summer blockbuster for sure. great that depp is back, cant wait for transcendence. :D
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaMorgan freeman :) !!!!!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaIm lost
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitato save him they uploaded him to a computer???
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaInteresting movie 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI was interested when I saw the teaser...aaand it&#39;s gone.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitalooks nice
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitafinally a trailer that doest says it all
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWally Pfister is basically Christopher Nolan&#39;s disciple ... this will be a fine film indeed.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaAaah. I won&#39;t say no to a fresh dose of techno fear.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaThe blouse behind the main girl at :35 looks like a skull face.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a bit lost but its probably one of those mind bending movies but it looks really good cannot wait
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaMatrix, Skynet, Lawn Mower Man, Ghost in the Shell
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitafirst half reminded me of max headroom
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaOk. They&#39;ve rebooted The Lawnmower Man.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaStop showing everything in the trailers! :(
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaGetting some serious Lawnmower Man vibes from this trailer. I can&#39;t wait to see it!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaFeels Like Inception 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s basically The Matrix meets Minority Report meets Lawnmower Man meets Source Code.........
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaIt looked interesting up until the part with the Supernatural/paranormal ghost crap happening. Could have made a good movie without all that other stuff
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaOh, Johnny Depp is going to play a normal character... Nope, he&#39;s a computer. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI read the full story for this and I Desperately want to see this. Depp&#39;s character kicks into full &#39;Lelouch-Vi-Britannia-mode&#39;! This is going to be awesome! I can&#39;t wait! It&#39;s also produced by Christopher Nolan, so that&#39;s a bonus. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaTrailer gives away too much
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitathis looks dumb. im gonna go read a book
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitalooks incredible..
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lukz">#lukz</a>
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaHaha! I new this was going to be awesome.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaFinally a good johnny deep movie +morgan freeman
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaThe teaser was compelling, but this has given me second thoughts. Too much magical looking shit happening. Unless he suddenly is capable of creating a whole bunch of new technology, which is probable, then i dont get it. Like, how was he making plants grow super quick? 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaLawnmower Man was better, and the blonde housewife is much more attractive than this lady. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshita Am afraid I can&#39;t let you do that....so how about a nice game of chess....you monster. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a matrix prequel !!!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitalooks good, but.....wtf?
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaso basically Jonny Depp is Skynet
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaDaaaaam 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit..
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaYes please.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EX3">#EX3</a>
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitawow, it looks good..
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m researching, and planning on freezing my head so I can wake up in the future in a self sufficient cybernetic body. I&#39;m doing this, cause I want to explore space. I&#39;ve looked it up, and it will cost me $90,000 to do it.  In the future the price might come down to do it.  I&#39;m young, so I&#39;ll learn a skilled trade that doesn&#39;t take a lot of time, and can make me a lot of money.  I am very series about this goal of mine, for it is not a joke. If people believe that its not going to work, and I&#39;m going to die. I have to die I&#39;ll die like this. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaman or his soul hops grid to go inside machine?<br>Watch the move called Lawn Mower Man<br>Reminds me of it.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitayup, stupid.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWell that just gave away the whole movie
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI just can&#39;t wait. Aahh!!! ♥
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaThe Matrix is that you?
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaEh
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaBasically this movie is about singularity, the breaking point between technology and humanity. This movie is based on real research that&#39;s being carried out today, google singularity and ray kurzweil. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaShouldn&#39;t Paul Bettany (AKA Jarvis) play the A.I.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWoo Hoo it is the modern take on THE LAWNMOWER MAN bahahahaha
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaYou people clearly don&#39;t understand what uploading is, what is done is your brain patterns are recorded and all the neurons and connections with all the chemical porccessors and then is simulated in a computer. Its supposed to be an exact copy of the person uploaded.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaMuch more interesting than the teaser.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitathis is so real!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaits like the ep. when bender from futurama got overclocked
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshita(O_O) There&#39;s just too many things to say......
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaCillian Murphy!
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWhen Morgan Freeman explains it, then it&#39;ll make perfect sense. Just like all his roles.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitathis feels like a pretty B-movie. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI love movies that start out like a normal reality, then shift into sci fi.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know what to think of it really.  Not used to seeing Johnny Depp in a non-Jack Sparrow-like character or Morgan Freeman as a non-Presididential figure haha.<br>The movie looks interesting.  Trailer looks a little confusing, but I bet the movie is going to be good.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s awesome cuz Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman are in it.<br><br>Oh, and an original synopsis.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m too high for this...and I still get it, pretty dope tho
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s basically a mixed of The Matrix and Inception...but I&#39;m still going to see it.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaA lot of the dark knight rises cast
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaHoly….I&#39;m watching this. 
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaJARVIS, the Scarecrow and Lucius Fox.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaMy unsolicited 1st reactions:<br><br>Dr. Castro is supposed to be like a Ray Kurzweil.<br><br>@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCTen3-B8GU&amp;t=1m29s">1:29</a> this communication is a stretch in terms of believability - à la the interface in &quot;Source Code&quot;.<br><br>@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCTen3-B8GU&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> Not entirely true.<br><br>Right at the end...@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCTen3-B8GU&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> titles are really Matrixy.

VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaEh
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaWanna see.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitawell that escalated quickly
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaMust see this.
VCTen3-B8GUdelimeterByIshitaGHOST IN THE SHELL .

_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaNumber one classic movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of d finest movie...EVER
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaEpic
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaKurt Cobain favored this story !!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of my fav movie❤️
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaHaft to do this in English wtf😂😭
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaa film that addresses one of the most neglected senses, which is smell, a sense that surpasses other sensese, because it resembles water in its material quality, uniqueness, and its vitality in the lives of all living beings, the smell triggers our instincts and awaken them from their static state to their utmost dynamics.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOh  Lord! What happened to Patrick Suskind to create that crazy fiction about &quot; the sublime beauty&quot; he wants to keep for ever in  a box before this beauty vanishs away !! I beleive it is impossible,  after this book, to create an other story like that! It is a story who speaks about, life, death,  love and beauty! The 4 themes obssessed by all the great poets of the world. <br>I love so much this beautiful film.  Cause THE SUBLIM BEAUTY is very the center of all that. And not only because of Laura or the young girl in Paris..All is beautiful.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe story is just amazed! The music is fabulous! By Berlin&#39;orchestra!.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies of all time.  A masterpiece
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitamust watch movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaSome more movies like this?? Anyone?
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie took my breath away along
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t believe this movie was released in 2006
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI was 10 when i first watch this movie,now im 24 and i want to watch it again
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s the first mutant
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaTerbaiklah movie ni
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaKurt cobain&#39;s favorite book.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI had tears in my eyes after watching this movie.Never in my life did such a movie touch my heart and soul.Whoever,he was fictional or real,God Bless Him!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe main actor is amazing. Lonely and heartless.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitajezuz i thought he’ll be a detective or something by smelling blood but nope
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaMonsta x I.M brought me here!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie dulls in comparison to the written novel, and the depiction of Grenouille just aint right.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThat scared ME😟<br>What kind of baby is that?
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaChangkyun ☺
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne hell Of a movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThat girl peeling the plums didn’t even scream in the book
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaNe biçim filmdi be
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaMy Favourite movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaTaehyung recommended this
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe ending is...... <br>I don&#39;t know... the ending is confusing for me I understood why he wanted to preserve smell so desperately but what was he expecting from the final perfume he made?? Why did he choose to end it all that way?? <br>I for some reason want to understand him better <br>I would read the novel if I get the chance
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this book.  I need to watch this movie again.  Thank you for reminding me of it Taehyung.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI love when Taehyung recommends movies, they are usually very good, I&#39;m so going to watch this one
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here after taehyungs live
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitais that man from the cloud atlas movie?
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitathis is the greatest movie ever made
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitathis movie f me up.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaIf you think cannibalism is love you are a sociopath.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaanyone here because of VIXX&#39;s Scentist (if you havn&#39;t, search it up - it&#39;s a great song based on this movie and its novel)
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaA classic movie which can never be created once more....
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaHow to make &quot;GAYUMA&quot;.<br>Watch this movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAn extraordinary fantastical fable.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaInspiring story!! If you think of the possibilities that this man (main character) didn&#39;t kill them. <br>The world would have been enjoying his discoveries.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaTürk yok mu la
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI think i was 17 years old when i saw this movie. It was defenitely stuck in my memory. Everything is perfect. The cast, the soundtrack, the colors, the camera work...and here i am 6 years later watching it again. I showed it to my boyfriend but sadly he was not very impressed. Mostly cause he was very tired but saw the movie for me. Still i wish he would enjoy it as much as i did
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaTempting, though everyone says to read the book first. I bought it last night at a bookstore in Saugerties because I&#39;ve been meaning to for a long time but just kept forgetting or putting it off. I learned about the book from Kurt Cobain. It was his favorite book. The song Scentless Apprentice was inspired by this book.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI read the book. Really good. Now i am courious bout this movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie. Very long and complicating and weird. But I must admit, the ending was epic
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie..
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitahi everyone reading this in 2019 go read the book it’s 10x better
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie so much
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so underhyped its sickening.. Beautiful artistic, Ben and Alan Rickman are masters of acting I stg
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaWHO MADE YOUR COMPUTER I DONT UNDERSTAND THEM DO YOU THE ONE YOU COMMENT ON DOES IT HAVE MULTIPLE INTERNAL CONTROLS OR BETTER PUT THE POWER EXISTS TO THE ONE WHO DESIGNED AN MADE IT TO WATCH OBSERVE YOU WITHOUT DEPENDENCY ON YOU SWITCHING ON AN OFF AN CAN SEE THROUGH THE CAMERA ON YOUR PC LOOK AT YOU AN YOU DONT KNOW ITS OPERATING BECAUSE ITS NOT<br> TO YOU BUT IS TO THE ONES WHO BUILT THEM FOR THE GRATIFICATION
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitabunu 4 kez izlememe rağmen sıkmadı kimse tavsiye etmiyor ama ben ediyorum
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI wish i could smell the movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a great fuckin comedy. Bravo!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThis is the one. Unparalleled.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaWe don&#39;t make movies like this anymore! Brilliant
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitastrong powerfull movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI believe this was the book Kurt cobain read at least 10 times and used events from it for a couple of his songs and said this book he would think about every single day
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this. And it was AMAZING. I was fully drawn into the whole thing. And it&#39;s just so sensual and mysterious . ❤
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAhhaah yet we did not know thier was another ted bundey..in 18 century
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaDo perfume the story of a  murderer
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI like the movie but the ending was disappointing
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe novel is a masterpiece, the movie is a work of art
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaLoved this
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely loved the book! The movie was fantastic too.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitawouldn&#39;t it be sad if he had to make perfumes to cover up their murders?
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaSo I just watched this on recommendation by my sister. Talk about one of the biggest WTF movies I’ve seen in a long time. I enjoyed it but got weirded out more than once and I about lost it at the giant orgy. Then the cannibalism to put a cherry on top... I nearly died.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever ... very deep .<br>It&#39;s a film for a small select group of people that can understand things hidden in the script .<br>Not for everyone ...
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie I have seen
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaKurt Kobain brought me here, the book that is, not the movie. Was looking  for a lazy read.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI know this movie! This is awesome!!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie really made me mad for 1week ugggh
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaWell I&#39;m here because of VIXX&#39;s Scentist song 😍
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this when I was in grade school and it kinda scarred me because I was scared of him &amp; the murders... watched it again as a grown up, I understood better and found it beautiful and haunting 👍
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most hauntingly enchanting movies out there. A masterpiece.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThoroughly enjoyed this movie.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of my fav
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAmaizing movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the title of the music? It&#39;s so cool!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaWhy did I just see this now??!!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitacan anyone suggest a masterpiece of movie like this?
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThe obsession leads you to the brink of madness.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely LOVED the book. and looks like the movie as well
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most sumptuous looking films ever made.  The ending is so amazing, one of my favorite films of the last decade. It’s finding it’s audience years after release.  I absolutely love this film from start to finish.  Please watch.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitathank goodness i never watched the trailer before watching the movie. it was a weird surprise for me watching it, but I really enjoyed it. the actors are amazing, and it was such a unique story.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI never knew it was based on a novel.. Ive watched it and it was an amazing experiance!!
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI was kinda disturbed after watching this movie.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitathe fact that this was my favorite novel and I didnt know about the movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaI came here because of VIXX....
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaThat is Hollywood nothing like anything
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaPerfection! From the beginning ‘til the end. Movies like this are on my list..
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaFavorite film ever! Ben Whishaw is a miracle, and this story is spellbinding.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaman I&#39;m having the weirdest case of mandela effect I thought Jake Gyllenhall was originally in this movie.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing, intoxicating, spellbinding novel. Good movie.
_-qv0EnGhJUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Based on the best-selling novel. From the director of &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;. &quot;Perfume: The Story Of A Murder&quot;.&quot;
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this film because of the series made.. I must say they could make the 2nd and 3rd installment of this film.. And the child Layra be played by Anya Taylor Joy and her friend be played by Nicholas Hoult.. The similarities are uncanny.. other characters will still be played by Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Sam Eliot, Eva Greene..
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is pretty cool, but the TV on HBO Max is so much better.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was pretty good back then, but my god the TV series &#39;His Dark Materials&#39; is EPIC!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie - but I gotta say the “His Dark Materials” version is just perfection!!! 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI ain&#39;t gonna lie but like if the afterlife is like this, I wouldn&#39;t mind it to be honest with you lot! Like okay it isn&#39;t no harps, angels ect ect, but at the same time though, it ain&#39;t no hell in my eyes! It&#39;s basically both sort of! Anyways I&#39;d go
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaWatched this movie in the theater so good
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaNicole Kidman would probably win an oscar in the sequels if there ever was one, Ruth Wilson did a great job given the complex character emotions, but Nicole might just bring it to the next level.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI really wished this got a trilogy
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitai saw the movie at home on a computer end of 2008 / beginning of 2009, a friend made me watch it and she knew why she was doing it. i loved it. i&#39;m stunned to see so many people hate it because they have read the books. since when a movie relates a story faithfully? the answer is never. so if you have read the book and are orthodox about it, go see another movie. this movie made me dream at a time in my life when i didn&#39;t have time to read novels b/c i was going through a darn spiritual awakening that was devastating my whole life. this movie appeared and gave me back some faith and helped me understand the concept (very real people, it&#39;s NOT a novel!) of daemons (the dark parts of ourselves in our subconscious that we need to heal in order to elevate ourselves and meet our soul and ascend). totem animals. power animal spirits. <br>you are all criticizing something like arrogant consumers who truly understand nothing about the deep symbolism of it, wasting your time on details like rich little kids when there is truly so much more about this film! it&#39;s sad and pathetic. even the compass has a meaning, the North has a meaning. people are so fxxxxg ignorant and apathetic and lazy they won&#39;t even research the meaning of symbols in the books they claim they love so much that they surpass everything else! that is the opposite of what this story is supposed to tell!!! you just don&#39;t get it, and that&#39;s why you are so critical about it! very religious, just like the Roman Church which apparently but un-surprisingly hated it too. the horrible religious think that plagues this planet. so obviously, you don&#39;t understand the underlying meaning of the books you rave about, you&#39;re completely missing the point and cruelly lacking humility in front of the teaching you were supposed to receive from it, the curiosity it was supposed to re-ignite in you to find your inner compass, your inner Truth and your inner North. your poor little lives certainly are not golden!!! <br>Gee! the visuals in this movie are gorgeous. the symbolism is sublime. so sublimely spiritual and mythological that the base 21st century disenchanted brain and heart cannot get it and prefer to analyze stupid technicalities instead. this is how lost our world is. we <i>so</i> need this Golden Compass!!!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitamacavoy is too small and unimpressive.. (current bbc adaptation)<br>Nicole Kidman was perfect as mrs Coulter (i.m.o.) <br>i still don&#39;t understand why they dint make the rest.. (of course i realise i&#39;m about the only one lol)  🙂 😉
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI thought the movie was good Start The issue was the catholic and extreme Christians protested it and pressured the studio to cancel it
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHis dark materials
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;His dark Materials&quot; show did a better job at adapting this series than this film
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita2023 from the devil you come to the devil you will return🧚‍♀️<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHYoOGfBObU&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a>
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaComparing to &quot;Her Dark Materials&quot; this looks horrible.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaJust finished watching the series on hbomax.  I liked it.  The movie sucked.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaTook me a while to see dark materials is this
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaWas anyone that worked on the LotR trilogy even involved in this or was the studio just trying to bank off the success of a completely unrelated series?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe Cast was amazing ans exactly how i imagined the characters. So sad that this film was made with so little love.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita15 years old; this was a good try even if it did end up failing so quickly <br>The film has a cool steampunk feeling to it along with some impressive CGI and I enjoyed the fantasy aspect <br>It&#39;s insanely violent in parts <br>It had an impeccable cast, too plus the daemons act out the humans and their inner turmoil <br>The issues however stem from director Chris Weitz having so much cliched dialogue and exposition in here but it does come together near the end <br>There&#39;s lots of stuff in here about religious heresy which of course isn&#39;t surprising since this movie offended the Roman Catholic Church <br>Freethinking, heretics, and putting aside centuries of teachings because of new discoveries are many of the main elements the story attempts to tackle <br>Much of the movie&#39;s controversy from religion and authority as well as the source material killed a potential franchise <br>This also tried to follow in the footsteps of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings <br>Plus this script is unfortunately crammed with so much stuff it barely leaves enough room for the characters to be developed <br>Even if the movie is considered an underperformer it did help necessitate New Line Cinema’s absorption into the Warner Bros. Discovery blob <br>The tv series thankfully did a much better job adapting these books so it wasn&#39;t all for nothing
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAnother damn epic journey. It’s always “an epic journey”. For hells sake when will people stop using the wayyy overused word “epic”??!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHhhhhhh
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIs this the crossover of the lord of the ring?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis came the same year as Stardust, another star studded fantasy adventure film. I’ve never watched either of these films, but looking at the posters, I honestly couldn’t tell apart them from one another. They looked like the same film. Hell, Ian McKellan narrated Stardust and voiced a character in this film  <br><br>Also, they got SAM ELLIOT, DANIEL CRAIG, and NICOLE KIDMAN to be in this?!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis cast in the TV series would be just phenomenal
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHis Dark Materials is better IMO
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaCome out, come out wherever you are, undefeated, strong warrior, gentle and after 8 rebirths the same beautiful daemon!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaEasily the most underrated fantasy film I&#39;ve seen, thus far.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaSo, this movie is now 15 years old.<br>Has it ever screened on televisions here in Australia, I wonder? 🤔<br>Because I&#39;ve never even HEARD of it until TODAY, 31 May 2022.  😲  It sure LOOKS spectacular, so something must have not quite worked.....<br>M 🦘🏏😎
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHerasay your honour
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care about the movie though but I absolutely loved the books
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaNicole Kidman is an amazing actress 😍 we should review this movie again
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThought the movie was great I don’t get the hate. Even if it did not stay faithful to source material of the books I think it can still stand on its own as a great work of art visually and acting-wise.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re telling you about the world and you ppl don&#39;t understand wow
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was a dream
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAt the end they cut going to save her father hope for a sequel
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why everyone hates this movie...it was good imo
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathe music from the trailer. it&#39;s from another film&#39;s soundtack, isn&#39;t it?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was ahead of its time
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAhmankohkoh Gregg sulkin ahpak uncle Thomas mummy geralyn papa kungkung Audrey red blue green yellow orange pink brown black white
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this remind me of the chronicles of narnia  XD
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHow tf have i never heard about this movie before
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI enjoy watching this movie on HBO in 2008 when I was a teenager
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHey guys I can&#39;t find anything about her
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathe much shorter version of His Dark Materials
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaDr.Scott McQuate is the Truth!<br> Big up to Brendon O&#39;connell.<br>Btw Thanks for the video(*_*)
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaMake these movies.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIt is so sad, that the Trilogie never ended
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI just notice, james bond (daniel craig) and vesper lynd(eva green) in this movie
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitabold of them to try to use Lord of The Rings as a reason for people to watch this movie
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe fight in this movie is 10 times epic than His Dark Material
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThe cast was pretty good as I recall, but if the tv adaptation has taught me anything it&#39;s that this story COULD NOT have been told in movie form. There was just too much that was too vital to cut.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathe golden compass is a secular humanist (Church of Man) monstrosity (albeit dialed down from the novels). The books denigrate Christianity and promote atheism to children. Pullman himself said his goal was to undermine Christian belief, marking his creative output as satanic...Glad it failed at the box office
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitahis dark material 😎
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so bad Ian mckellen was good though
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI recently finished reading the book and it was far better than this version. Granted there were parts of it I liked yet the HBO series was more faithful to the text (though it had its deviations too). This certainly would have been better had events not been changed and a lot omitted from the script.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThey should have never even tried to make this book a movie
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaStill waiting for a sequel, <br>Legend says that there are still fans waiting for its sequel
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaDamn I love this movie so much.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHeyy nil, sude ve damlaa burdayım
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita🧭  my destiny not in yours...
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHYoOGfBObU&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a> it&#39;s just volibear from League of Legends video game lmao
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIm in 2021
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaUsing The Lord Of The Rings to attract audience attention just feels wrong
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathe actors were good, but the effort to put this mountain of a story into just a movie was doomed to fail
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaBased off book
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaSo this movie is set again in middle earth
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaSince &#39;Release the Snyder Cut&#39; actually worked, how about getting the director&#39;s cut of this released ha.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis cast would have been great in the HBO series
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitai have this book for a school project. Can someone tell me the difference between the book and the movie? Thanks!!!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathe polar bear doesnt sound like ian mckellen
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaReal loose definition of Classic trailer
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaYes?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitathis cast was phenomenal, where did they go wrong haha
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI started watching his Dark materials and i was like, why do I know this story?<br>Now I know 😂
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitai love this movie
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHYoOGfBObU&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a></b><b> Is that my favorite 007 agent?</b> so weird to think about it...
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshita&quot;His dark material&quot;  is the series..
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m currently reading the first book in the trilogy! Hopefully will be good or even better than the movie.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaSol bealtyfull, but... so blank
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaFun fact Nicole Kidman and Kate Winslet were in the running for the role of the White Witch in Chronicles of Narnia after Michelle Pfeiffer famously turned down the role.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaHis dark material
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitahis dark materials &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this movie
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI definitely get Mortal Engines design vibes from the automobiles.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion, the Golden compass will never be the next Lord of the rings or Narnia.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI am here because His dark materials,anyone ???
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaI come to Future to talk<br>The Golden Compass become a series
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThey cut basically EVERYTHING and the movie moves so fast, like one minute she is all amazed and interested with Mrs Coulter and then the next minute she is already besties with Lorek, like wtf
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s up with Hollywood coming up with ridiculous names for movies like this? Northern lights sounds much better compared to Golden compass.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what the music in the trailer was. ?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAs bad as this adaptation is, does anyone else REALLY love the cast though?! Nicole Kidman sounds exactly like the woman who voiced her in the audiobook and I was just so excited for this 😔
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaLamo 😂 😂
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaAny actress of Mrs Marisa Coulter would always have high expectations to live up to as she’s been described as the most graceful and elegant woman one would know.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIt’s not as terrible as Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, but it’s still not a good adaptation.<br> BBC is working on making it as a tv series, let’s hope they’ll do a much better job than this movie did.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaIt did
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitagolden compass never came did it?
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaRead The Book!!!!!
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie could have been awesome if only they wouldn&#39;t have cut almost everything.
LHYoOGfBObUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie could not &quot;not fail&quot;. <br><br>Which is really sad though since it had a lot of potential!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaMEGAMIND: 1:46 Yer Kidding right?
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita1:31 Beware if da MILITIA......
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaOCRAM: HEH HEH...  I Remember playing as Sgt. Roach down there.  Good Times..  Good Times.....
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@blackroseblade hee sounds like him. i think it is
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitais the toucan ... George Lopez?
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaoh how i wish i was in my cage with my mirror and my little bell :( lolz 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaToucan Lopez
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaThey actually made a lady with a huge Brazilian butt, lol 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaIf this is just the teaser trailer, then it will probably actually be really good.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaNow this looks like this would be good in 3d
Cloudy didn&#39;t take any chances in it
Alice in wonderland didn&#39;t have much
Alpha and omega did have some but not alot 
BUT THIS LOOKS AWESOME!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita1:03 am I hearing things, or did he say the &quot;S&quot; word...? :o
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like another fish-out-of-water buddy odyssey story, but those can be quite entertaining if done right (see: Bolt).  And hey, really cute Spix&#39;s Macaws as a bonus!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@juniper427 No one was really sure what the simpsons movie was about either, and everybody wanted to see it for that reason. 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@idontubewithyou It&#39;s not the type of soccer ball you are used to. That one is for sand.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaim proud of my city, at least we are having the attention that this city really deserves.
thank the olympic games and world cup, i just hope our politicians and banditry dont mess with all this stuff, thats my big concern.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@frufru9700 Sergio Mendes &quot;Mas Que Nada&quot; feat. The Black Eyed Peas
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@Joiner113 Sergio Mendes &quot;Mas Que Nada&quot; feat. The Black Eyed Peas
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@strongsavage777 Sergio Mendes &quot;Mas Que Nada&quot; feat. The Black Eyed Peas
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaOh, Rio de Janeiro... the most beautiful pleace in the world. Perfect teaser!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaFROOT LOOPS THE MOVIE
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@MrExpendableJr OMFG!!! wat is so bad about geoge lopez being a f**king voice actor?! just stop being such an a**hole and see the godd**n movie!!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaacho que vou gostar...parece bem legal
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitalooks funny to me, I&#39;ll take my son to go see it
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@MoscoMoon666 

Of course, I think wolves&#39; reputation has already been ruined by Wolfaboos but that&#39;s just my opinion.

Ga&#39;Hoole looks epic from what I&#39;ve seen (and I&#39;m reading the books too), but remember that Animal Logic is veering more towards realism and story while Blue Sky is more about the humor and is much more cartoony.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaNow that looks like fun!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaLooks much better than Alpha and Omega.
And it&#39;s about birds. I love birds. I think they&#39;re much cooler than wolves. Huh.

I love the character animations and the colourful scenery. Blue Sky&#39;s animation is gorgeous because while it&#39;s CGI, it somewhat has the same movements and flow of classic 2D animations.

I can&#39;t wait for this one 8D
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@o0OAaronO0o yes i miss 2D too
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a funny move :D
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitawhy r they making all the movies 3d all of a sudden?

Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaGORGE LOPEZ 4 EVER!!!!!!!!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THIS SONG!!!??
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s my name here
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaWooow...funny! :D
no..no, Blue Wait!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita0:47
que e essa porra ?

Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita27rueg4m3r ... wait... I thought it wasn&#39;t even in theaters...
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita:))=)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita:))=)0
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@frufru9700 The song&#39;s name is &quot;Mais Que Nada&quot; played by Sergio Mendes &amp; Brazil 66. 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitawhats the song called
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaBoing 1:48 over and over.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gonna be AMAZING! very cool! I Like it.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita3D is overrated. I&#39;m sorry but pretty effects wont make a movie better.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitalooks shit
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaI only liked the hit to the butt.... nice ass
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitais the voice of the toucan george lopez?how come i nvr saw this in my television? alright!! imma watch this
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@atheistworstenemy primeiro, eu sou mulher. segundo, não sou homossexual, sou hétero. terceiro, e se eu fosse, algum problema? quarto, vá escrever coisas idiotas pra quem se importa.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@luhe8 você é um homossexual
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@strongsavage777 &quot;Mais que nada&quot; 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@luhe8 , concordo plenamente! 

Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaAmericans, admit it, Brazil rules!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitafinally a movie about us that doesnt envolve drugs, poverty or favela....it feels good :D
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitalaame
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaamericanos são tão previsíveis. tão reclamando do filme só porque não foi feito sobre os eua, afinal, pra eles não existem outros países no mundo. egoístas
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@FlyFoxAir Mas Que Nada by Sergio Mendes. 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@kermicheo Yeah I still have some hope in it. So I hope it will be good. In my opinion the first Ice Age was the best of blue sky so far. 
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of that song at the end ?
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@InvaderMB LMFAO
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@aguering  well,nobody saw a real point when UP&#39;s trailer was released,they didn&#39;t know how it could be really interesting,a house going up in the sky.But,when they saw it,most people enjoyed it.I,in fact,thought I would not really enjoy it,but I loved it.It could be the same with Rio.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why the bad comments, I really like it... I&#39;m from South America, not from Brazil but I do feel this is gonna be fun.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@LordAnthrax74 Yeah I would know its a pain to make animation films in 3D. true its not just about typing keys. Animation student here going to school, but I do miss 2D films.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaDarn. This looks less interesting than most blue sky films. I loved the first Ice age, and I liked horton hears a who, but this doesn&#39;t look as good.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitageorge is a horrible actor
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitalooks like a cute movie
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaeh
Does it have any storytelling ? Or is it just pure patriotism bullshit ? 
Open up your eyes, Saldanha. Give reason for this to exist. I don&#39;t see any (yet).
Cheers from BRAZIL.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@LordAnthrax74 NO i dont care lol i want my 2d films too not jus 3d all the time
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaStupid cheap 3d tricks.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@evanbellen Much better then! Some jackasses like to fake the reality just to atract some attention to their useless works! There are some that isn&#39;t totally useless like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, at least they are just making fun and succeded in it indeed. But I can point &quot;Turistas&quot; as an example! What the fuck of movie was that? Totally RUBBISH! xP
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@ytmetroid Não é Pixar, é da Blue Sky, criadora do Ice Age (Era do Gelo). A Blue Sky é americana mas liderada pelo brasileiro Carlos Saldanha.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@WeAllDieGo no way, the director and creator from Ice Age is brazilian
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@acboyko Sergio Mendes - &quot;Mas que Nada&quot;, there&#39;s also a version with The Black Eyed Peas.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@InvaderMB why? what&#39;s wrong with george lopez
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita1:48 #LOL

Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita1:48, Hot
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaSomeone PLEASE make Goerge Lopez stay away from animated movies.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaVERY COOL!!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaytmetroid, esse filme não é da pixar, é do carlos saldanha e os estúdios que fizeram A Era do Gelo.

Adorei o trailer, btw.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaNão me canso de ver.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitacool *-*

Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshita@chicocool654 Actually, I think it&#39;s Niel Patrick Harris.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaGEORGE LOPEZ!!! LOL!!!!
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitaHmm, looks good.
Bf6zeRwk5LEdelimeterByIshitapixar or dreamworks?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawhat a great movie this will be
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshita2pac did talk a lot of shit but he was influenced by the wrong people ie suge knight.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI always thought he looked like Biggie
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitathey should have cast Fredro Star as Tupac
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThe whole brooklyn borough is going to be at the movies the day this releases hahaha
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitapor favor alguien me puede decir el nombre del tema q suena exactamente en e minuto  1:58 muchas gracias
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitai herdz its like meth, but it eats your intestines so you lookz smaller.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaoic now.

liposuctionz right?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaiz biggiez still alive?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaFOR REAL??? Don&#39;t even see da movie
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitait looks actually pretty well done.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie comes out 1 month after Soulja Boys album Go Figure and I&#39;m from Brooklyn but BIG was not the best rapper........................Tupac Shakur WAS!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitapreviews can make anything look good.

all i gotta say: they better not fuck this one up.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like one best movies made about Rap ever
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawhats that song when they say  &quot;no no notoriuous
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaDat iz true.But in The movie they wanted 2 put a Charlie Baltimore lookin chicc in it 2 cover it up since Big had a thing wit her 2.Plus dats how she looked like bacc in the day.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaIm glad they put dat car crash in the movie.Not alot of people kno about dat and tha reason he had dat kane.He wasn&#39;t tryin 2 b cool,he needed it.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThats supposed 2 b Charlie Baltimore
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitago fuck yourself guy under me this movies gonna be the best
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like its gonna be a good movie can&#39;t wait.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaLIL&#39; LIM IS NOT who Faith beats down in the trailer. Looks like a white woman to me, actually. Pause the clip at 2:04 and you&#39;ll see.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definitely with you on that. I was wondering the same thing -- and I&#39;m not Jamaican.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThey made a movie about Eazy.  It was called CB4.  West coast gangsta rap was a joke then.  New york owned it then.  Biggie wouldn&#39;t own it now, nor would Jay-Z.  You watch 106&amp;Park and know white style and asian dances are takin&#39; over.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaall you pro pac or pro biggie boys are all messed up they both were the shit, they had conflict over nothing, and if ask anyone it all these haters setting them up to start beef.

Lookin forward to seeing this movie
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it&#39;s going to be a dope movie.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitalooks like a fuckin great movie
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaman people dont even listin to pac and still say he&quot;s the best ,pac was a good rapper but bigge was better.
RIP bigge n pac
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitao yea
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitan that too lol wicked!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI think Derek Luke and Anthony Mackie are hurting their careers with films like these. They are slowly getting typed cast. They are better than this...
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaso is Snoop in the movie? I wonder who could play him
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawhat you talking about?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s not faith evans..the girl just looks like her alot!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitai honestly think tht the dude playin biggie dont look like him !! thts just my opinion but umm yea cant wait til the movie come out !
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitai just hope they dont make pac out to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitathis movie is going to be really good i wish they would do a movie like this for pac
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshita2:10 Omg they even have the part when Pac get got in the elevator!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshita@ :58 that was d roc...he is a true friend he took the fall for biggie and the hot 97 shoot out
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaNo worries man.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaHe means sick in a good way. He trying to say the movie is going to be hot. duhhhhhhhhhhhh
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawtf you talking about bitch
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaIts Notorious! off his last album. that came out in 99.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaeveryone in the stuy gonna see this
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI knew Faith caught Lil Kim and Biggie in bed, but I didn&#39;t know Faith kicked Lil Kim&#39;s ass.....damn...looking forward to that
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitadis shit gon be raw next year da movies gon be pack im gone see dis shit but i wouldn&#39;t agree dat biggie is the greatest rapper ever cause i would have to leave dat title wit Pac but dis gon be just like Get rich or die tryin
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitathis movies gonna be sick
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitai cant wait 2 see this movie biggie from my city theaters gonna be packed
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitacasting sucks?

man you got Derek Luke, Angela Bassett, Anthony Mckie,  all great actors, especially in the black entertainment... 

I know the choice for Biggie is good, because Mrs. Wallace, Biggie&#39;s mom, picked him, and if she has faith in him, then I sure do
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaTupac Resurrection...watch it
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitahow was it? how was Gravy&#39;s performance
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshita&quot;What kind of grown man calls himself Puff Daddy?&quot; 

LOL that was epic!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawho is his homeboy that went to jail for him.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI NEED to see this movie.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawhy didn&#39;t they make the guy playing biggie gain more weight biggie was way bigger than that and who playing dr.dre in thiz!!!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitahow u gott ppl commentng this trailer not knowin da bea from da begining ofit ya shud kno dat song is juicy,  dats a B.I.G classic
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaguriella black should play biggie =P
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawat the begining tune?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaWho is u think is playing pac cause i don&#39;t see it. the dude playing pac is Anthony McKee, the same dude that played in &quot;Crossover&quot; and 8 Mile.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitanotorious or maybe notorious b.i.g and no i&#39;m not an idiot, i know thats his name but its also the name of the song
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaof course its gonna be biass
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitatupac movie would have been better
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitalolz...Angela Bassett said, What kind of grown ass man calls himself Puffy?!, I can&#39;t wait to see this movie...RIP Notorious B.I.G. a.k.a Frank White.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaNOTORIOUS AKA THE GREATEST
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaMaby Not but to be honest all he would have to do is be like his dad and he dose that pretty well, he has the same mentality just maby need a little more charisma Eazy was a boss in CPT, i think it would be a damn good movie tho, and im sure the rest of NWA would be willing to participate in it.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI miss him so much
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitawtf?!?! lol
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaonly...it would probably be a hot mess....
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitathis looks very worth looking at ...

i hope this movie is succesful
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaahhh interesting...thank you for that piece of information...
and yer im with you on that one too haha i dont give a fuck how long it is, i&#39;ll sit there without blinking and watch his life unfold like you said...
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaNah theres only Lve to tell which the script the Pac wrote whilst in prison which is sorta based on his life. Im with you i really wanna see a Tupac movie even if its 5 hours long from start to end i would watch every part of his life unfold.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshita1:58 Fake ass friends biggie which got you killed mate. RIP
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitayer, casting sucks...
and ahh, queensda I agree with you lol
i hope they dont make out like pacs the bad guy...

and they really do need to make a movie based on pacs life...apparently they were gonna make one but i dont know, might of heard wrong..

Peace...
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitai can not wait to see this movie!!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaLOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaMAN WHEN THEY MAKIN A TUPAC MOVIE?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaThey could&#39;ve did better with casting
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitahell yeah, how they going to cast a cleo huxtible look-a-like as puff?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaa movie about eazy-e will not sell that much, cause in this movie you have the drama with 2pac, hope they ll not have 2pac in this movie as the bad guy, they should make a movie about 2pac, he is much better than biggy
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitato be honest they could just use Lil Eazy E , his son looks just like his dad
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitayeah but isn&#39;t that a documentary?  I&#39;d like to see an actor portray the life of Tupac.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaCant wait!!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitathat is true, can&#39;t argue with u there
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitadamn, he doesn&#39;t really look like tupac tho, god damn it
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitacuz he almost fucked up NWA juss to get sum money, thats why Ice Cube left them...
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaIt was all a dream
I used to read word up magazine
Saltnpepa and heavy d up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every saturday rap attack, mr. magic, marley marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember rappin duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitapapa doc from 8 mile, sorry dont know the actors name, they showed him in the trailer
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaAnthony Mackie
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know who&#39;s gon&#39; play pac?
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitahip hop will never be the same because of limewire
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaTupac do need one but he got one called Tupac ressurection
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaDerek Luke was the perfect person to play rPuff...I was sayin that all throught the trailer
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaDerek Luke was the perfect person to play puffy...i was sayin that all throught the trailer
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaiiight BIG was reppin BK all day but pac had more skillz
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaNo disrespect to Biggie, he&#39;s arguably the greatest to ever pic up a mic, but I&#39;m not sure his life was as interesting as, say, Tupac Shakur&#39;s.  He was an incredible rapper but he didn&#39;t change the world.  He just changed hip hop.  I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d much rather see a 2pac movie.  Also, the actor&#39;s voice is too high to play Biggie and Derek Luke looks and sounds nothing like Puffy.  I don&#39;t think this movie&#39;s gonna do to well.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaAmen. I think that guy was probably not a good fit to play Puff. The guy playing BIG, though, is perfect.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d rather wish they would make a 2pac AND Biggie film, not separate.
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitayeee
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaNA! NA! Notrious!!!!!!!!!!!
kDDv6pAbN_UdelimeterByIshitaohh yes about FUCKING TIME!!!!

Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing bad that happend to the first How to Train Your Dragon was that Pixar stole the oscar from them. I will NEVER forget that injustice as long as I live!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI really hate the voice actor they chose for these movies, but eh. Otherwise, looks like it&#39;ll be another good movie
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshita:0 OMG THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshita:0 OMG THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaТак долго ждать...
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitawaiting for 300 part 2? pffff, HTTYD2 all the way baby!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see the fuss about the &quot;spoiler.&quot; I really don&#39;t care for the &quot;your parents are still alive&quot; cliche and would have been a bit ticked off if this had been a &quot;twist&quot;...
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M JUST GONNA KEEP REWATCHING THIS UNTIL THE MOVIE COMES OUT OKAY.
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9a4PvzlqoQ&amp;t=1m24s">1:24</a> ...But a mother never forgets... OMG
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaThose new dragonssss omggggg 
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshita&quot;Protect our people. Its your destiny!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What you&#39;re searching for, is in here!&quot; <br><br>ALL. THE. FEELS!!!  <br><br>DEAN DEBLOIS FOR THE WIN!!!<br><br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI just can&#39;t wait to see it!!! &lt;3
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaWHO DARES DISLIKE THIS!!!!!! I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaOkay, it&#39;s fine, I got excited. Although I was expecting something more... I don&#39;t know what, but &quot;something&quot; (don&#39;t ask me whay, I have no idea what it is). The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is adorable, I like it even more than before. How they present Valka... not my favorite part. Hiccstrid, nothing special. But over all, I liked it. Any way, it&#39;s a second part, isn&#39;t it? And... alright!!! I admit it, Hiccup is <b>-</b> GORGEOUS!!!!!!! I know, now I have to swallow my words.
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaOMFG IM SO EXCITED
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! Thank you!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaA ver, está bien. Aunque me esperaba algo más (no me preguntéis ese algo, que no lo sé). La relación Hipo-Desdentao cada vez me gusta más. Cómo presentan a Valka... meh. Hiccstrid, meh. Pero en general, me ha gustado. Al fin y al cabo es una segunda parte. Y vaaaaale; he de reconocer que Hipo está +-+. Lo sé, ahora tengo que tragarme mis palabras.
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitait would be awesome if theres a female night fury for toothless
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitai love the toothless laugh  :3
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitathe end, oh my gosh SO CUTE
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaWhen his mom came on the screen I started hollering. 
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaDreamworks, for the love of god please dont give out spoilers
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY YEEEESSSSSS!!!!! OMG VALKA IS THERE AHHHHHHH!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaGoodbye friends I am dead
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitayeahhhh!!!!!!!! tis here!!!! cant wait for the movie!!!!
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaAmazing trailer this is one of my going to look forward Movies in 2014!!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HTTYD2">#HTTYD2</a>  
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitathe vikings looks like they&#39;re cavemen like the croods rather than actual vikings 
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI am SO watching this when it comes out. Hopefully. (Also, Cate Blanchett&#39;s scene here is the BEST :OOO)
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHAHAAH NO LO PUEDO CREER, MAS DE 3 AÑOS PARA VER ESTE TRAILER Y YA ESTA AQUÍ :D
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaCATCTUALLY I AREADAY SCREAMED
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitagot to say, unlike the trailer for the first movie this one actually makes me want to see this, but of course the terror of this being a fluke is also present (especially the whole &quot;mother lives&quot; part)
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI WANT TO SCREAM
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI AM HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting a princess mononoke vibe from valka...actually the entire movie
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with this whole mother thing, they had helmets made out of her BREAST PLATE IN THE FIRST MOVIE.
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaI wouldn&#39;t count myself as part of the millions of people who absolutely LOVED the first movie as I thought it was just simply &quot;good but not great&quot;. I wasn&#39;t too fond of either the designs for the dragons or the voice work by Jay Baruchel (his voice can be too grating at times).<br><br>With that said, this trailer for the sequel looks absolutely epic and has me really excited to see it... despite the unoriginal title.
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaAHH this is awesome and cute
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitacRAP
Z9a4PvzlqoQdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FREAKING JESUS NEW DRAGON SPECIES ADARJLAIRHCIAVHIANHIH!!!!!

ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaOh my god what a terrible movie this will be
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be stupid, why do people buy in to zombie movies at this point, they are overplayed.
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitanah
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThe cat scene was funnier than it should have been.
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaI thought zombies were so 10 min ago...
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really lame and stupid. Is this a zombie movie or a parody of one? :P
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: They got pretty high in the club and it was all a DREAM!
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitasong <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOhSbNJ7MqI&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> ?

ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaBesides the whole cat zombie bit, this looks like a fun movie. Mainly cause I just got my Eagle Scout.
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it could be pretty decent for a horror comedy.
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThe main plot is boobs
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Everyone dies at the end
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks funny to me!

ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaNothing can beat Shaun of the dead
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaOpens on Friday, closes on Saturday. Five years too late.
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks dumb enough to not make any top tens but funny enough for most people to watch it and enjoy themselves...
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaГо ко мне на канал!
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks retarded
ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaanother zombie land

ZOhSbNJ7MqIdelimeterByIshitaGod, how many more zombie apocalypse comedies do we need?<br>And THIS one&#39;s been crossbred with &quot;Superbad&quot; for some reason.

IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaI remember discovering Robocop thru that Jack Black and Mos Def movie Be Kind Rewind. The one where they remake all those timeless classics
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good movie, albeit a little far fetched...there is no realistic way that Detroit&#39;s crime rate would be as low as it is in the movie!
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaMy frome is yamen
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaYes I love you Murphey 1987

IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaThe first movie I watched at cinema at 6 years old. Never forgot the dread 😅
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaHe kind of reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger by the way he talks.
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie today for the first time. It&#39;s truly a badass film. We need technology like this to stop crime. That would be nice.
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshita🏆🎥

IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this movie properly now, but I remember it was pretty extreme and a little traumatizing for me ,and I couldn&#39;t even understand much of it back then...
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies directed by Paul Verhoeven since Basic Instinct

IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaOne of My Favorite Movies of the 80&#39;s Can&#39;t Wait for The Sequel RoboCop Returns and The Game 2023 RoboCop: Rogue City
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaSci-Fi Classic Movie 😎😍 <br>Unfortunately not the original trailer
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best films of the 80s
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitawe are closer to 2029 than 1987. I think i&#39;m starting to grow a beard
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaAmerica 2021. 😮   On a film buff&#39;s note: this movie is awesome! Historical.  Groundbreaking.
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaAnother great movie by Paul Verhoeven (with the screenplay of Neumeier). Great cast, great special effetcs by Tippett, gorgeous make-up by Rob Bottin and don&#39;t forget the OST made by Basil Poledouris
IqvRDhW-XVAdelimeterByIshitaJust realized that it&#39;s the year 2029 in that movie and we are only 7 years from it...hmmm

43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaany recommendation on good thriller movies but not scare like train to busan and so on
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitacan someone explain me plz? why did the japanese guy become demon at the end??
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaAll of those who haven&#39;t seen it yet this is a master piece
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita♥ i LOVE THRILLER + HORROR <del>-</del>&gt; JAPANESE , KOREAN , THAILAND
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaA thriller with police who are the main characters act like frightened grade school children. I actually laughed at the attempt to create drama and edge of your seat chills when you know if a loud sound is made the cops will go running away screaming and tripping over themselves.<br>Think RuPaul stars in Dirty Harry. How serious would that drama be?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaChaeyoung brought me here.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaUh.. I want a part 2?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita뭣이 중헌디
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitacome here because hoya infinite mention on hit the stage , this... awesome... I NEED TO WATCH IT
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI still have yet to figure out if Chun Woo-Hee&#39;s character was good or bad.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI did a review on The Wailing in my channel. Feel free to check it out!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathe director  Na said, &quot;this is comedy movie (?)
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathere was a scene here that really creeped me out .Good movie in my opinion.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitafeels like a crazy ass movie man!<br>reminds me of that movie, can&#39;t remember name: Mojo?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaIf not the best..this should be on my top list
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaMan, this movie doesn&#39;t disappoint. I was all hyped up due to rave reviews. 2 and a half hours flew by without you knowing it. Crazy good. This is why I love Korean thriller movies, more focused on characters and ultimately plot twists. So much to admire more than a bunch of cheap thrills Hollywood has been offering.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaunbelievable movie. still in my head.. korean movies are the best
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathis movie is scary as hell,after watched this,I got nightmare....dayum
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaInfinity Challenge + 1Night and 2 Days brought me here.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaAre they going to film part two of this movie? The ending made me confused a little bit. 
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita2 Days &amp; 1 Night brought me here... XD
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitadamn, this looks good
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitacame here from 2 night 1 day...
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaIm so confused, somebody please enlighten me. <br>Who is the women in white?<br>Are the japan and korean shaman in the same team? Or they are rival each other? <br>Why they killed people?<br>What the meaning of the hanging plant?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaWho is behind all of these? Japan shaman, woman in white, or korean shaman?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathis movie could be better than old boy in a certain way.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathis movie very scary and twist really awesome
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita2 days 1 night brought me here.. :)
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaCame here from 2 Days 1 Night .. didnt know they have a release a great horror movie this year ...
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaWatched it yesterday. Crazy movie. Reminds me a bit of the howling man.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitascary movie!!! was grt! gave me goosegumps
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaHwang Jung-Min is hands down the coolest actor in Korea. No matter what role he plays he nails it with his own brand of style.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaOkay guys, was it natural that me, my friends and everyone in the auditiorim of the Fantasia film festival I went were laughing at some of the parts of the movie that seemed scary at first? LOL.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaWow! Korean films are awesome! Very good film!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitalast 38 minutes make me confuse which one real which one fake   amazing
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis is like The Witch but it&#39;s not nearly as good.The movie is way too long and the lead was damn irritating.The first 40 min are the best with all the mistery going on, the following hour it drags and the plot goes nowhere. I was excited over the hype around it but was disapointed.Scenary , photography and the japanese were good.Would not recommend it.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathe ending is so sad, damn it. why couldn&#39;t the father help his family, he should&#39;ve listen to the girl.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaJust watched it and I&#39;m glad I did. Hands down, one of the best thriller/horror movies I&#39;ve ever seen. It deserves all the recognitions it&#39;s been getting.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitasame ol korean shit...cliffhanger...!!!!!!!!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitadirector make us can&#39;t think who is good..
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis is a really nice movie but the ending just made me so curious
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaHats off this movie really exceed beyond my expectation there are soooo many things tht had been bordering me left me with questioned in my head especially tht white dress girl what she is ? an angel ? dem im so absorbed into the movie lol
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathe background music is Wasteland - Ninja Tracks
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThe Yellow Sea is so overrated, btw. If you guys hated the zombie scene in The Wailing, I fucking find the scenes in Yellow Sea so ridiculous where the guys got stabbed like a dozen times and still managed to go on a rampage and kill more than a dozen of uninjured enemies, he only died when he drove a truck, wtf! That&#39;s more unbelievable than zombie attacking peeps. This new movie is way more entertaining and not cartoonish to me.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this. It&#39;s more like a mystery thriller than a horror, tho it&#39;s still creepy. And you should be knowledgeable on Asian and shaman culture to draw the pieces of twists together, but if you want to be weirded out and utterly horrified, better stay clueless as the events unfold. The most unsettling and chilling moment to me was (don&#39;t worry, not a spoiler) when the father confronted his daughter for the first time about her shoe, I was nervous about what the daughter would answer (I had a sick and fucked up guess/theory looming on my mind but I was glad it didn&#39;t happen in the movie cuz it might&#39;ve messed me for days. Tell me if someone wants to know.)<br>This movie is really entertaining and riveting even after seeing it. Not as great as Park Chan Wook&#39;s and Bong Joon-ho&#39;s auteur and pyrotechnical genius in directing but the quality and hype is on par with them.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis is the kind of trailer that will make you want to watch the movie than those other trailers that will make you know what the entire movie is all about.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has to be filed under weird and slow. Nothing make sense.  People are dying for no reason.  Unless demon want to take over the world, why would they attack a small town.  Spoiler: the old Japanese man and the shaman are demon.  Everyone died in the end.  FIN !
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best korean movie i have ever seen... You Must Watch it.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best horror movie....you must understand some Asian culture on mysticism to fully understand whats happening in this movie... it is far different from Western&#39;s horror movie, where the good guys always win.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaAlways love watching Korean movies they are more realistic than Chinese movies!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI got chills watching this yesterday, really interesting movie.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://kissasian.com/Drama/The-Wailing/Movie?id=29327">http://kissasian.com/Drama/The-Wailing/Movie?id=29327</a> full movie
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI liked the movie but there were some plot holes (in my opinion they were plot holes). Worth the watch in my opinion. Not as disturbing/terrifying as I thought it might be, or wanted. But I guess that&#39;s fine since I live alone and don&#39;t want to get all paranoid.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaso who is the main culprit ?????? y he or she was doing it???
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitainteresting
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI hope this gets a screening in Canada...or at least in my city :(
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched.....
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThanks Huber!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI really wish kim yoon seok was in this :(
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitajust watched this movie.  All I want to say is that, This Movie is one of the BEST movies I&#39;d seen in last a few years. I will be buying blue-ray when it comes out. I want to keep this in my movie collecting shelf. FKING AMAZING.  Worth the money.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaIm about to quit watching Hollywood films and start watching Korean films.. These Koreans know how to make movies that&#39;s out of this world
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit. Walked into this one with absolutely no idea what it was. Came out very satisfied!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucks
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this last night. Best korean thriller i ever saw =]
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis film was fucking terrifying.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaAlright. I am a Korean. I don&#39;t like the films directed by Mr. Na. Chaser, yellow sea? They suck and are boring. But geez.. I can&#39;t stop being tempted by this movie. I could hardly take a deep breath while I was watching it. If you have a chance, you must see it. This is life time movie for me.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita이거 재밌냐?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was AMAZING. It was actually a lot funnier than I imagined it would be. Korea waited six years for another Na Hong-jin movie, and it was totally worth it.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitauna pelicula koreana buena la voya a  ir a ver
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita예고편이 이렇게 재미 없을 정도면 본편은 형편 없겠네.........
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI love these kind of Asian films, so far I&#39;ve seen New World, The Chaser, Old boy, Mother, The Host, I Saw the Devil and Memories of Murder. Does anyone have some suggestions for similar Korean/Asian crime trillers like those? This one looks great too.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaWhy are Koreans always trying to make the countryside look like devil land?  They treat it like the Wild West or some shit.  XD
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaWatched this today. Don&#39;t be trapped in director&#39;s intention.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita우리나라가요즘뜨고있으니좋다
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitabest korean movie ever
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitalooks great! very strong wicker man vibe without the massive fail lol

43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitathis is noting like chaser or yellow sea, this one is horror movie.<br>one of the best horror movie ever.

43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaYou will be trapped in the one insane small town that is nowhere to go. <br>You will be fucked up in very weird horrors.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI watched this few hours ago...and you guys better forget about chaser or yellow sea...this is whole different. Tbh I&#39;ve never seen movie like this. This is insane. Idk what to say. Idk even this is good or bad way
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitai realy like the yellow sea and the chaser from Na Hong-jin. I will watch this ..cant wait :)
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitasome ceitics said this movie is the best in Cannes
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitai thought it was about kim chenun
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitakorean films never disssapoint when it comes to thriller genre
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a game changer. It&#39;s like a puzzle without a straight answer with a twist.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaHELLO WORLD I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE YESTERDAY, AND IT WAS JUST BEST KOREAN MOVIE EVER IN HISTORY. GREAT GREAT MOVIE
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitapark chan wook kim jee woon Bong Joon-ho and now na hong jin south  korea is full of amazing directors
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Korean. I think The wailing was one of the best movies in years.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitabest Korean movie hands down!!!!! if this doesn&#39;t win in Cannes, I don&#39;t wanna live in this planet anymore
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitai already watched this flim at the premiere. and i think this film is one of the finest korean film from 2010 to now.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaDamn I cannot wait. Love both films by this director.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaYes, more Korean movies please, most of the best cinema are their doing, looking forward to this! And is that the same chubby guy can is the same amazing actor from The Host, Memories of a Murder, Thirst, and other great Korean films?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaI loved The Chaser and The Yellow Sea so this was a must see for me before even seeing the trailer. After seeing the trailer I&#39;m not even more excited for it.
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks very good,look forward to watching it
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good!
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshita?
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitakinda reminds me of Memories of A Murder by Bong (kinda)
43uAputjI4kdelimeterByIshitaYELLOW SEA was fantastic. Super excited for this one!
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitadid they hook up
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaSally Field actually doesn&#39;t look bad at all for an older lady. When she was younger though, wow.
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaI love Sally Field since she played a nun sybil with all those different personalities and Hello My name is Doris is so funny LOL the tight pants that&#39;s me all the way listening to rap music
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s crazy is she is almost 70 here 😲
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaThis is a great ,sweet ,quirky film. Of course Sally&#39;s acting is incredible.
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaWhere can I watch it again? I had it on my pc watched it many many times and still want to watch it again 🥰
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaThis movie was really good
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaEsse filme é muito legal!😍 Adoro Sally Field!❤
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaI really liked how Doris cleaned up her hoard. This is the only movie whereby I&#39;ve seen a character having such an issue and finally dealing with it. However, I didn&#39;t think she should have quit her job. Probably going on vacation, gaining spiritual balance, meeting somebody new and doing a makeover are also ways of dealing with loss, heartache and finding the courage to move on.
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaLove this movie!
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaDoes Sally Field bath in formaldehyde or does she just drink A LOT of Vodka - straight?
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitadoes she actually nail the guy?..cause...whoa
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaI love Sally Field wheather she&#39;s 20 or 200 years old!  FINALLY!  A movie with substance AND a great actress/star whose plot has a rare subject matter!  I can&#39;t help but notice the horn rimmed glasses.  Hmm, why does it make a connection?  Ahh.. SYBIL, Sally Field&#39;s old movie.  Can&#39;t wait to see &quot;Hello, My Name Is Doris,&quot; it looks like it&#39;ll be fun, satisfying, educational and uplifting!  :D
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaI cant wait to see this movie.
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaLove Love Love Sally Fields... Look like a great film!!
ZxfwqNvrl78delimeterByIshitaGreat trailer! What&#39;s the song playing towards the end???

UQK5Hh0L1SgdelimeterByIshitaBONNIE, GET BACK IN MYSTIC FALLS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UQK5Hh0L1SgdelimeterByIshitaSome of those scenes must have been hilarious to film. Like when Zac had to stuff his face &quot;I&#39;m just hungry all the time&quot;. It must have been (to a point) really entertaining to just eat...and eat...and eat and have a legitimate reason to do it.
UQK5Hh0L1SgdelimeterByIshitaмакс ты проста класс

KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaactually its 300 times ten
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaso its king aurthur, 300 and gladiator thrown together./.... :-/
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaI am going to see this ftw!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if they are referring to the legion that was slaughtered by Boudicca. If so I do hope they show her downfall.

Also, FINALLY! A movie where the Romans aren&#39;t the villains.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitameh
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S A TARP!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a tarp!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalol 0:55 was so cheesy
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaWow! finally another movie thats watchable
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaFail.  (Oh, wait.  Sorry.  I meant to say EPIC fail.)  :D
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this movie look so bad to people, i think i t looks good
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks boring
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitahollywood taking another giant steaming dump over ancient history then I see.
Still, probably make for good watching none-the-less, like King Arthur did.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitadont be jealous
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitathis is why they built hadrian&#39;s wall.

don&#39;t fuck with the Scottish!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Centurion, we have enemy picts in sector 47!&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a trap!&quot; :P
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks good
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitanaah..suks
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitacool
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitabelieve it or not, the black people weren&#39;t seen as slaves, a slave in the roman empire could be both white and black
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaITSATRAP! 

Yes, again.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalive united or die divided, has to be the best line ever
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaand now 7 cowards who hid under the dead body&#39;s of there friends bla bla :)
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitafreaking EPIC!! definatley gonna be my new favorite movie of the year
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIt has everything to do with encouraging the myth that women were badasses in the history and that they can beat the crap out of guys bigger than them you dumbass. 

How is portraying skinny supermodel type woman as a kickass heroine or villain fun you dweeb... ITS STUPID. 

You haven&#39;t ever met me and yet you assume that I take history lessons from hollywood. Nonsense little child....your are so dumb, you surely make your parents proud.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@PhatSteve7 ign sometimes post random stuff.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitareminds me if 300
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@PhatSteve7 because they can
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitathat looks fuckin class
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitajust might be worth watching...
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaNOEL CLARKE!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@midbluegreen lol Canada doesn&#39;t have much of a history to make films about to be fair.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitablack legionaire really?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaRomans spoke English? Huh. Did not know that. -_-
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaits a trap!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaLame
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaI am a fan of this genre and i will be watching this movie.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitabth they weren&#39;t recruited, rather forced to join  because for the most part they were slaves
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitayou are stupid everyone knows that black people existed back then, especially in the roman empires were they were recruited
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaOMG High tempo MUSIC!! Text that&#39;s saying THINGS!!! ACTION SEQUENCES!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!

This is... not that much of an original trailer when you think about it...
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaAnd since when are the Romans the good guys in movies?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaWhen you said that (before I actually started watching the trailer), I thought this was going to be about Boudica and the Battle of Watling. But I guess not, this movie doesn&#39;t look all that good, but I&#39;ll end up seeing it, because I like the era and I always go see the historical epics.

However, it seems in any case Hollywood has scaled back their productions quite a bit, these types of movies look like they are favoring the few survivor heroes rather than fielding large armies.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaat least he&#39;s not a main character
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitablack people were probably from the north african colonies of rome.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitahaha. yeah I noticed the same thing. since when were blacks part of the roman legions ?? haha
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitatwo problems i have with this thing
1- did they really need to throw in the celtic female warrior, who will no doubt help them and fall in love with the protagonist. 
2- token black guy? really, are we still throwing in black people to tick the box under &quot;diversity&quot;.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty cool
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitanothing new.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaDAMN i wanna see it
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaThe plot reminds me somewhat of The Warriors (or  more accurately Anabasis).
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitawas there seriousley a black guy back then
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks very good.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitahahaha i know right
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIts micky from Dr. Who :)
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaCenturions are only fun when theres Oblix around
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIts McNulty!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaFassbender was fricking brilliant in Inglorious Bastards. I hated that he died so quickly. Looking forward to see how he does with a lead role.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks alright
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks beyond shit
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita300 2? xD! kidding this looks really good.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks cool xD
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaCRAP
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S A TRAAAP!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@Anamchara ah mmm...i think ive seen niel marshall in the credits of king arthur...maybe im wrong lol xD
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaNope, King Arthur was directed by Antoine Fuqua XP
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@Anamchara niel marshall is the same director of this movie and King Arthur...thats why it looks similar i think...
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitawell it could be worse from the title i thought it was gonna be a movie based on the 80&#39;s cartoon :-S
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks like dookie
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaPortraying skinny supermodel women as someone who can kick-a** big time in an unrealistic way has everything to do with political correctness you idiot.
Girl power....ring any bells.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks like another 300 film u know last stand and blah blah. but will never compare to 300. 300 was awsome. still its good to se another medevil ish film.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@mk13ultra4th
But you can clearly tell from the plot, acting and general quality of the film that they do!

If you haven&#39;t worked it out by now that was sarcasm
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaBlack man in the roman army..
cool -.-
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitanoel clarke?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitahahahahaha
IT`S A TRAP!!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaFAIL
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but not much
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason it reminds me of that King Arthur pseudo-historical thing... which I liked as a movie, but not as an adaptation of the Arthurian legend. However, this one looks like another movie set on making tribes defending their homeland look like monstrous savages... sounds familiar, George W. Bush?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalooks boring
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaits a trap! and this possibly looks like the worst movie ever made.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitasooo.. what is this movie about?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaStraight to DVD.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaThe only good thing that I can see in this movie is that it has Mickey from Dr. Who in it. :P
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaI fucking hate these &quot;Hollywood we know all about european history movies&quot;!!!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@monchandclaxbach It&#39;s a legend, thats the cool thing about it
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitathis movie is a trap to take your money!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaThis doesnt look half bad. Im pretty sure it will be a blend of Gladiator and King Arthur (the one with Clive Owen).
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaim only gunna watch this if the barbarian chick gets naked
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaITS A TRAP!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaYeah but it sells lol that&#39;s all they want these days ..........
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita@ninjabrocly  picts...
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitalol. is this real...
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaADMIRAL ACKBAR &quot;ITS A TRAP!!!!!!!!!&quot;
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaITs a TRAP!!!
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaOh wow, include women warriors that have skinny arms and look like a bunch of supermodels. 

How politically correct is that. 

Ridiculous
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaI honestly thought they were making a movie of the Centurions 80s Cartoon, so i am disappointed in a way which is not related to the movie
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaRoman Britain maybe not.
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshita4th comment
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitaLooks okay, battle of Teutonberg forest maybe?
KOZs2_i_cDEdelimeterByIshitasick naaaaaaaaaaasssssssstttttttyyyyyyyyy

ip_CYHdyUBsdelimeterByIshitaDo you or anyone else you know suffer from Low T? Is your man not performing in the bedroom? Well I don&#39;t know what to tell you because this movie will make your man feel like the little bitch that he is and it just may put his testosterone level through the roof where he goes around beating the kids, kicking the cat, smashing all the fruit in the house and pulling your hair (you might like that part). Whatever. This is gonna be DELICIOUS!!!
ip_CYHdyUBsdelimeterByIshital really hope this movie comes out good, oh please god just want pure action &lt;3

ip_CYHdyUBsdelimeterByIshitaidk if you know why i said that and if you dont its because chuck norris threw a fit when he found out how much they curse so they turned the movie from a rated r film into a pg13 film, that might also mean that a lot of the cool gory kills might be out too

ip_CYHdyUBsdelimeterByIshitaHow much Lion Tranqulizer did they use on Chuck Norris? Lol, jk.
ip_CYHdyUBsdelimeterByIshitaFirst!

bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaAcdc after cybertron before cybertron. Clue
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaRed green blue
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaTsngerine clue
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaFarm house ah clue clue maybe .
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaBlack purple
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaBig man M flip look at it straight flip upside down
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaHit evil copy 2twice how That fate
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaWb megatron bitchs
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis was awesome. The trailer, that is. Not the movie.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaNo good black sun déception punch wrong Person
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie saved the franchise.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI just stumbled across this trailer and thought, what&#39;s that? then I remembered that this movie was so boring and so shite I almost instantly forgot about it after I watched it. <br><br>Actionless drivel with an awful story line, filled to the brim with continuity errors.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was flawlessly directed, produced and executed. The only problem was scriptwise. The plane scene alone is better than they&#39;ve shown us in the past five years seriously in terms of suspense action.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaHey Ray you do playing at being Superman?
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s be honest, while this movie was a definite disappointment over all, I just don&#39;t know that we will ever see a Lex Luthor as awesome as Kevin Spacey was in this flick. Kevin Spacey was born to play Lex Luthor, it&#39;s just too bad he was kind of wasted for this film. Too bad they couldn&#39;t have somehow managed to bring him back as Sexy Lexy for Batman v. Superman. Oh well.<br>  Oh, and the music was pretty cool too, especially during the Lex scenes. I love &quot;Not like the train set&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaSo his suit doesnt have holes when hit with bullets but kriptonite can go straight through, great!
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaDamn, the bullet to the eye scene though ...
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this in the movie theater and wondering...how the fuck did the guy who did Xmen 1 and 2 direct this piece of garbage?  Sorry if you like this...but I thought it was fucking awful.  I honesty dislike Superman in general...because a goody goody hero with no weaknesses but some glowing green rock is just moronic...but jesus christ...I don&#39;t understand how you go from Xmen 2 to this trash...
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaShit movie, Kevin Spacey was a good Lex Luthor though.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThe best superman movie so far is superman 2 Donner cut..Still waiting..
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitathis guy looks more like superman than henry cavil
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis was an amazing trailer for what was ultimately a disappointing film
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaSuperman has a Jewish look to him. His hair has to be black and his skin needs an olive shade to it. Man of Steel portrayed the Superman image correctly, unlike this movie.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis was nothing less then awesome, great story.Could have used a second movie really
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaMan of Steel shits on this movie!
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitak
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitawait wait wait ... i wasnt ready isnt this ray palmer in the DC COMIC
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaHey Bryan singer WHERE THE FUCK WAS U WHEN XMEN 3 WAS MADE OH THATS RIGHT DIRECTING SUPERMAN THE WHO GIVES A SHIT EDITION
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe Nicholas Cage was about to play Superman. He looks nothing like Superman.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaWas this movie ment to be a continuing from superman quest of peace? 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaTHE ATOM
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaomg xD
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaIt will be funny if man of steel superman on batman v superman if superman betrays the world wtf are they fighting did superman on his second  movie say I am so powerful  I should  rule  the world then doomsday come and fuck  him up I understand him fighting doomsday but why batman
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitathis movie was so boring I was almost tempted to just skipped to parts with kevin spacey
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaHe was a good Christopher reeves replacement but Henry Cavill is the best superman ever 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI mean I love man of steel but when I hoped on the bad wagon and said I hated this film I&#39;m like wait did I hate this film? When I watch the trailer I like it idk looks cool plus Kevin as lex is awesome 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaGives a new meaning to a hard look (last scene)
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was really bad. Man of Steel was a fresh start. Man of Steel was not perfect. there was a lot of flaws. but its shaping up to be perfect. This movie should have been cancelled. Brandon Routh played superman very well. but Henry Cavil showed us what superman can really be like.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaOnly good because of Kevin Spacey
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was a great nastalgia trip for the classic superman movies as a tie in.<br>MoS is a great reboot and new way of telling the superman story anew.<br>Both movies are good for different reasons. I like them both. The plane scene in SR was amazing and the flight scene in MoS was one of the best scenes in any superhero movie. 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI mean he is ray palmer
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaHe I a ray palmier from arrow and the flash
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaSUPER  MAN  HELPS  EVERY  ONE  = ACRONYM 4 FIVE GREAT LAKES<br>SUPERIOR  MICHIGAN  HURON  ERIE  ONTARIO
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaMan of steel didn&#39;t even have the damn theme??? 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI heard that Brandon Routh stole the red cape from Clive Owen.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaMan of steel vs superman, hihiihih
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaAh yes, I remember this god awful Superman flick. An emo superman that doesnt punch ANYTHING against Lex Luthor and a fucking real estate scam.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitagood trailer. heard the movie was meh
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaMeh....He does Ray Palmer better 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaRouth is a way better superman than cavil.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaPeople say Man of Steel was too grey and colorless... but this movie has the exact same colors and tones. In fact, the cape in this movie is actually a <b>darker</b> red (more like burgundy) than the one in Man of Steel, which is a true deep red.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaSo, what people don&#39;t understand.. Is this is a continuation movie off of the Quest for Peace. It&#39;s not a remake, it&#39;s more like a reboot.. It&#39;s suppose to be like the Reeves movies with its own unique twist. This movie delivered way more then Man of Steel. I can admit, Man of Steel was a great action movie.. But as a Superman movie.. it failed to deliver on so many levels..
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this like 50 times when I was little...I still think it&#39;s amazing even though the acting is eek..
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaAt least this film has the original music... Man of Steel should have had it in there somewhere.... And you can so tell that it Man of Steel was trying to be too much like Batman Begins.. But Man Of Steel is the better film  lol.... Just missing the original music :) 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThat was a pretty bad Lex Luthor.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI never really was a big superman fan
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaYeah I always liked batman better than superman
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaEven Singer himself admitted that this movie should be different. He didn&#39;t like the outcome. 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps....  this is way better tan Man of Steel, or should i say &quot;superman begins&quot;.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI love that movie 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI like this superman suit better than man of steel&#39;s
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked soo bad I can&#39;t imagine how much it annoyed the fans + it ruined the actor&#39;s career from the beginning..
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaAnd now atom
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaMan Of Steel Superman was a badass that fought the way Superman should fight unlike this version.  Henry Cavill is way better.  Get the fuck over the Christopher Reeve syndrome and get with the times.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis was better than &#39;Man of steel&#39;
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaBrandon Routh was the perfect replacement for Christopher Reeve.  I will never understand the hate this movie has received, I thought it was a very good follow up to the older ones... although the ending was a little drawn out and they could have written out the son arc altogether.  WB should have gone with their gut instinct and continued the saga with sequels off this movie.  Man of Steel was terrible and I&#39;m guessing Superman vs Batman will be equally as bad.  
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI think Kevin Spaceys role was better then supermans role in this movie. 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaman of steel is far better then this shit
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaKevin Spacey&#39;s Lex Luthor was awesome!
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was good, I wish they had done sequels.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitawhats that song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRqAUqAFhNw&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> ??
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitathis movie blew dick the new one was better.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaAny comic readers here? Who the fuck is kitty tagging with lex? I watched smallville but there was no mention of her
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaIs it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&#39;s Atom!
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI reading a Superman comic where Lex Luther helps Superman against General Zod
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshita กุชอบหล่อมาก
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaBrandon Routh is incredible as Superman!&lt;3
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThe best thing about this trailer is Kevin Spacey.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaI actually liked this movie.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is visually stunning but blows giant balls.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite superhero movie so far from 2006 <br>Love this film
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitagood trailer 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitawhata shitty trailer<br>better watch trailer 3   for this movie
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThank you so much for this Classic trailers thing!
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaSuperman is gay
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaPlz Brian singer if your going to make a superhero movie then stay with x-men! If he didn&#39;t leave Xmen 3  then that would have been a better movie and this would have been a better movie 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaYou know what makes no sense is you mean to tell me superman was gone for 5 years and nothing bad happened in that time and when he gets back things go bad there is no way.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitamovie is horrible. 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaWish the movie was epic as this trailer is. Still not as bad as most people assume.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is horrible movie 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitathis is my favorite superman movie so far
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s ironic how the bruce banner proposed series became smallville because they feared a competition with Batman Begins... and then this film came while Smallville was in Season 6
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaD.C. &gt; Marvel
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitafilme sem vilao nenhum para o super cade os seus conterraneos de cripton, ou alguma ameaça pra ele. isso dai foi um piquinique pra ele kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaStop pleaaaaaase make it stop!!!!<br>Sack Snyder arrives <br>Everyone cheers 
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps !<br>Much better than MoS in my opinion.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaIt sucks that there were no super powered battles for supes to partake in while watching this movie.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer. Shite film.
bRqAUqAFhNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the only trailer that give me chills
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaDisgusting in every single way. Just the idea of girls/young women being indoctrinated in all of this, makes me sick. Please come soon Lord Jesus!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWow! It’s the immaculate production values for me; I can’t wait to watch this.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaHow did they make it look like it was shot in the 70s? Did they shoot it on film?
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaProbably my favorite horror movie of the moment!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaBest movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThe Aesthetics of this movie were really beautiful. The colors, outfits, attention to details of the set pieces, all were very impressive. It&#39;s also interesting how the whole movie seems like it&#39;s in the 70s, but then randomly a brand new BMW drives up, so someone uses a cell phone. One funny moment that I almost missed was a character refers to &quot;all those old Steve McQueen movies&quot; - which would have been current if it was in the 70s. It definitely wasn&#39;t scary but was beautiful and fun to watch.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI’ve seen some photos and memes from this movie, and I GENUINELY thought it was made in the 70s 😂
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaLana del rey would fit this role.... she even looks like her lmao
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaas a woman love is overrated. If you have to do all this then forget it lol. I’d rather live alone
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitai cant get over how good this film looks
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitathe deviant in me stayed for the sexy witch stuff
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely love this film! ❤️
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis isn’t rapey to anyone
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of Lana Del Rey more than Lana Del Rey reminds me of herself
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I get this movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaMartin Scorsese missed a trick with this.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaok hang on this is a movie thats meant to be set in the 1960&#39;s but yet they made one hell of  a boo boo, majority of all the cars in the movie and background are of modern cars from 2016 and a few years older ones too as it was 2016 when this was made, so am i only the one seeing these modern cars of 2016 in a movie set in the 2016? lol unreal boo boo ;-)
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI can’t believe it! I thought its was from the 70s
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThe first guy remaind me Alan Watts
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI feel like her and Jennifer from Jennifer’s body would be bffs 👯
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaBest movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI just found out about the movie just now and I feel like they were inspired a lot by the Japanese movie helter skelter  from 2012 🤷‍♀️
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it was made in the 60s - not just retro 60s but a genuine 60s film.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI loved it
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaHuh how did i end up here........
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWritten produced and directed... welp she will certainly have her own vision
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThey’ve made a movie about Lana Del Rey
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitathis film is freakin&#39; amazing i 100% recommend
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIs it a 2016 movie??? It doesn&#39;t seems like...
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThere are a number of reasons why the movie looks like a 70&#39;s movie. There will be film color, fashion and makeup. However, the biggest reason is lighting. When you look at some scenes, you can see unnatural shadows even though they were shot indoors, like a 70&#39;s movie. This is due to the cinematography techniques of the 70&#39;s, when the level of cinematography was low. The director does not miss even such details.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaEven her voice sounds like Lana
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t watched this yet but I absolutely love the trailer. Can&#39;t wait 💖😍
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite film of all time!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI want that movie in german please!!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaGreat, супер!!!<br><a href="https://youtu.be/5RYSoV_f8fU">https://youtu.be/5RYSoV_f8fU</a>
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitafrom a lana video this looks amazing
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Suspiria meets Rosemary&#39;s Baby but looks like Bewitched.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was a 80s classic movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI swear I kept seeing clips of this movies thinking it was from the 70s
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI wonder who women <i>really</i> love and care about... because <i>it&#39;s certainly not men.</i>
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis is pure evil
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI’ve just research this film 🎞 and I don’t understand that it’s new and it has the Appearance of a film from the 70’s or 80’s
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWatch it 144p then you&#39;ll feel the 70&#39;s vibes .
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIf not 2016 attached to it.....I would really believe if it came out in 70&#39;s ...holy shit!!!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaDamn, it&#39;s looks so believably old ;-;
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve seen the whole movie! Thanks, Youtube! 👍
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWait this was made in 2016?!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like i&#39;ve watched the entire movie.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIf you like retro horror like this, also check out It Follows, and House of the Devil.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitathis is very marx
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThe best
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaLana Del Rey so obviously has a smoking fetish, as bad as Eva Green and Lady Gaga.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like it was made to appeal to me personally. To make me happy.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaBtw eventually marcus dies
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWow. Production values of the 2010s, style, color palette, sensibility and even acting style circa 1968-75 or so. Brilliantly executed. Gorgeous set and costume work, too.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaLooks incredible!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaShe drugs, rapes and murders men for fun... wtf
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitathis remind me with heathers style movie
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so fucking weird seeing that filmstock with modern acting.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaher and lizzy grant have LITERALLY the same voice it&#39;s insane
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitathat girl is 100% beautifull.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaMy kinda girl!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitai had to do a triple-check to see if it was released in 2016... such amazing 60s-70s aesthetic
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaSOUNDS LIKE MOM
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie,its fantastic!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitait seems completely inspired by the life of PATRICIA KENNEALY,a famous witch in the 70&#39;s,music journalist and lover of jim morrison among others.tarot cards obsessed and a feminist precursor...she actually married jim morrison in a witchcraft ceremony exchanging bloods.if you see the movie &quot;the doors&quot; and read her autobiography you would understand why I&#39;m saying this.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaHow&#39;s a moive like this so high in ratings I mean yah it looks real beautiful i guess but it&#39;s trippy af looking and probably is only good to watch on shrooms...then they give good shit bad reviews why i dont listen to critics
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis is basically the entire movie in three minutes.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it was shot in Eureka/Arcata!
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaFuuwww... Lucky me, just watched the trailer &amp; I&#39;m done with it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhaIRevB-Y&amp;t=2m44s">2:44</a> mins instead of 2Hrs
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitawhen lana del rey goes witchy on us
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaGonna watch it JUST FOR THE NUDITY.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWTF no really WTF?
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWTF did I just witch...?
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitakewl 70s tone, wish more movies were made in this style... looks authentic except camera quality is cleaner, reminds me of Tarantino&#39;s Grindhouse flicks
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie today. Such a film. 9/10 for me.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWhen I watched this awesome film , I was transfixed. not since I watched fellini have I seen a film where every single scene was visually stunning. I couldn&#39;t look away. as an artist  finding new visual stimulation is rare. but the love witch satisfied me.... many time over... obsessed with Anna. all Anna&#39;s are awesome.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitawatched this last night mainly for the beautiful aesthetic and witchy vibes... and was happy to find it carries important messages on feminism in a non annoying way. Noice movie, real noice. WATCH ITTT
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaNo sé porque terminé aquí XD Jajaja
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWho would need a love potion to love her 💚 she&#39;s bae.

BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaomg this is everything.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaso good
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaThis remonds me of the real-life cult, the O.T.O. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis</a>). Is this even a real movie?
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaInteresting. It has a certain je ne sais quo. Its is c&#39;est magnifique.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaReally impressive that they made a film that looks so like it was made in the 70s. Looks beautiful.
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitawtf did I just watch
BHhaIRevB-YdelimeterByIshitaWow.... I couldn&#39;t even keep it up for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhaIRevB-Y&amp;t=2m45s">2:45</a> that it lasts... had to bring that shit ass trailer Down!
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry to ruin this with my trashy self but..<br>the title of the movie sounds like the title to a song Tyler Joseph would make<br>I&#39;m so so so sorry
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaA movie length Lincoln commercial
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks like shit
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail looked like a photo of an emaciated Castiel.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was trees killing people movie. This way is good either :)
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitathis film is alright alright alright
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitazzz zzz zzz 😪😪😪
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshita100
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a snooze-fest to me.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaGive me a film with Mccougnhey to watch,<br>and I&#39;ll show you how to watch a movie without blinking
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitasnooooze ! couldn&#39;t get through the damn trailer that was so boring
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI feel the title has alot to do with the ending
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitawow, the folks at A24 are putting out some amazing movies. please keep it coming and I&#39;ll keep going to the theather.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI hope this doesn&#39;t turn out to be one of those pretentiously philosophical films with hipster cinematography and mood filters.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m willing to bet, that Ken wantanabe&#39;s character is dead from suicide, or mcconahey has committed suicide and just doesn&#39;t know it yet
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaMore crap from hollyshit.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSo that movie that got booed on Cannes?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks very promising i can see this winning an oscar.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitathe music sounds like the composure from LOST
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooked like tai Lopez in the thumb nail
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQvC9V1eLsE&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a> sounds a bit selfish of her
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSea of trees? Oh Jukai. Got it.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so boring
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaMe when i see the title: &quot;Omg The sea of trees, this will be the best ficcion movie of the year...&quot;<br>Me when i see the trailer: &quot;I&#39;m a potato&quot;
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWhen I saw the title I was thinking of Aokigahara (which is translated to sea of trees) or the suicide forest as it&#39;s aptly named.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks like shit
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe music of this trailer is beautiful. Performed by Chamber Orchestra of London and is called &quot;Broken People&quot;. Enjoy:<br><a href="https://vimeo.com/139391347">https://vimeo.com/139391347</a>
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaBoring af
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaDamn I&#39;ll bet a lot of people are too fucking stupid to think this might be good...but it might be good.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitasea of trees, hmmm, i think it&#39;s called a forest guys
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaIs this one of those movies made for winning Oscars again? Something lefty intellects go around making serious reviews before going to their fetish BDSM shows?<br>I think I&#39;ll pass.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshita<b>This looks horrible.</b>
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI was like &quot; Oh this could be a good movie &#39;&#39;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>then i saw that it&#39;s rated PG-13
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but I heard it was garbage... Oh well maybe next time
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWhy was Sea of Trees by God is an Astronaut not used for the movie? Wasted opportunity
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a movie that could finally portrait the suicide forest as it really is, not as some kind of horror movie scenario. At least that is what I hope it could be.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaugh i bet it&#39;s gonna be good. piano, good acting, emotions, sicky.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaMuuurph
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSpoilers! She dies and he&#39;s trying to kill himself.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaStarting like that Lincoln advertisement
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitastill waiting for &quot;Let them fight&quot;
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: He&#39;s already dead.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWhy is Matthew McConaughey in this movie? That Forest is JAPANESEEEE. Cultural appropriation something something, lack of  poc roles something something.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaso he takes his wife to japan so she can kill herself in the forest?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t this movie at cannes two years ago?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaEither A24 can really put together a great trailer or the film isn&#39;t as bad as everyone has said it is.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaYou know what would be super trippy? If she kills him in the end then right before she kills herself she screams &quot;Where is your God now???!!!&quot;
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitadeath is peaceful
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaAlright alright alriiiiiiiiiiight
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI watched this-two minute trailer, and I still have no clue what the premise of the movie is or why I&#39;d want to see it. A failure of a trailer.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaA24 makes some great thought provoking movies, can&#39;t wait to see this.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaA sea of trees? You know they call that a &quot;forest&quot;.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaPrediction: she commits suicide. Why else is it called the sea of trees (aka the suicide forest)?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLet them fight...
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe amount of penis jokes in this movie is too dam high.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitafrom the name and thumbnail, I thought this was gonna be a horror movie about a forest that came to life and killed people. I think I was wrong. :/
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitalooks like shit. who would want to watch all the stress caused by this pretentious film? boooo!
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWaited 2 years to see this trailer.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThat was lovely!
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe Mri detected a small ass
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSuicide Forrest in Japan
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWho let Matthew out of his Lincoln MKS!?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI slightly  get the fountain vibes from this.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitathe trailer does nothing for me, but would be still willing to give it a chance
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaShe dies. He goes to Japan to the Suicide Forest. He&#39;s in the forest as the audience learns what happens. He probably changes his mind. Or hangs himself there.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSequel to mud
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshita&quot;If God is not waiting for you on the other side, then who is?&quot;<br>I&#39;ll watch this just because how great I think that line was.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThey both die and woke up to realize it was dream and Mr. Saito was testing them.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI have a feeling that she does die and he&#39;s walking threw that forest alone and talking to that guy having flashbacks of everything  that went down leading up to when she dies and he&#39;s heading to that place were she wanted to go . Kinda like a titanic situation were the guy tells the story and ends with the present day situation idk
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaShe dies .
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so confused if it&#39;s a highly basic procedure why is she scared to die.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaAlright, alright, alright.  I&#39;ll see anything with MM at this point.  And Naomi Watts is a damn fine actor, too.  Not to mention that this film is directed by Gus Van Sant.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaKen Watanabe&#39;s character is the McConaughey&#39;s reincarnated wife. Wrap your mind around that degree of stupid
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshita&quot;True dat.&quot;
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaI hope that couch scene is not the ending where she dies. it will really be the worst trailer spoiler of all time.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaShe dies at the end mark my words
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaBating that Oscar, huh?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaBleeegh
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaHopefully with A24 picking it up, we can expect good things. I heard the film suffered at festivals, which baffles me according to the star power.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe reviews say it may not be a good movie, but holy shit the make it look like a Terrence Malick film, I was so in awe with the music and cinematography I wanted to cry!!
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThey should have gone with the first trailer. Displays more emotional stress and curiosity.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitayeah this looks good. don&#39;t know why it got booed
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a Malick film without the fish eye lenses and the coma inducing voiceovers
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s certainly a well cut trailer.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaVery beautiful looking film. I&#39;ll give it a shot.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaA movie a lot of married couples can identify with. The pain and compromise.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaReminded me of Rust :)
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaCritics slayed him at cannes but lets wait and see.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThey really should have shot this actually in Japan. The woods look way too much like Massachusetts. Takes me out of it
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaThe reviews are terrible but the trailer actually looks pretty good...hmmm
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaAlright Alright Alright, another one in the watchlist
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaStill don&#39;t get, why it got booed at Cannes ?<br><br>It&#39;s look so GODDAMN GOOD!
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks lovely. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaKen Watanabe: Let Them Cry<br>Matthew McConaughey: Alright Alright Alright
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like crap
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaSong name?
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaFuck the critics. I&#39;m gonna watch the movie.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaJust the other day I was wondering when this would be released. I&#39;ve extremely curious to see what all the critical attention was about.
PQvC9V1eLsEdelimeterByIshitaWell... At least photography looks handsome?
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaYa know it looked like he was crazy running from nothing, then I remembered some crazy ethanol fires. Stuff burns low temp so you can&#39;t even see the flames.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaI saw Step Brothers. This looks good to.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaI have never saw this movie. I seen Old School though.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitar and k brought me here
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaI still don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t have Ricky Bobby on Mt. Rushmore.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaThis, the Other Guys, Napoleon Dynamite, Wedding Crashers. His wife is a catch in this movie.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song at the start and the one that goes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfGRg0FLxtE&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfGRg0FLxtE&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a>? does anyone know?

YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaricky bobby
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaInstant personal classic. It&#39;s funny as heck, very entertaining, smart, impressive (the cars, the races!), with great comedic and dramatic timing, well shot etc etc  Not surprised at all that Nolan, who knows his cinema, really likes this movie: it&#39;s head and shoulders above the pack!
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie talladega nights

YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is way funnier than Material Girls with The Duff Sisters.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaWhen I was a kid I was actually in this movie. The best part was hanging out with Walker &amp; Texas Ranger, and of course meeting Will Ferrell in the flesh haha. It was a crazy day, they turned our church into a movie set for a day, they had provided the best buffet of food for breakfast/lunch/dinner, and we kids even had on-set education (which was mostly a joke, our teacher just had us do mad libs which turned overtly sexual thanks to our misbehavior heehee)
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaGot a random recommend on my YT newsfeed that its Nolan&#39;s favourite comedy movie. Now I must watch this.
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaevery time I see this it reminds me of Daniel Ricciardo for no reason !!
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaWhy is the soundtrack to this trailer so good? 😂
YfGRg0FLxtEdelimeterByIshitaThis is Nolan&#39;s favourite comedy movie, definitely gonna watch it.

fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaUm bom filme. Gostei. Valeu muito. Julianne Hougt é demais
fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaMan and director who rewrote the original script should honestly be taken out in the middle of the field and horsewhipped they destroyed the original movie

fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshita“I treated you decent” is an all time hilarious villain line and I’m so glad Craig Brewer used it again in the sequel
fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaOld footloose was lit🔥😙
fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaSorry but you try to remake the original but they’ll never improve on it. Just one genXer’s opinion.

fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaPhotography and cinematography of this movie was superb. A dance movie with a message. Good film 👍🏼

fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaThis I don&#39;t understand.  What&#39;s the reasoning behind this rule?  Five seniors got into a car accident and died after they had been <i>dancing?</i>  So the powers that be determined that it could <i>only</i> have been <i>because</i> they had been dancing?<br>&quot;Don&#39;t dance!  It makes you irresponsible!&quot;

fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaWow... This looks really shitty compared to the original
fVyU-Hvzpt4delimeterByIshitaThis is basically a Step Up movie, with a message. -_-
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaMy heart hurts
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaomg yes yes yes yes! I picked up this book around last year and read the sequel a couple months ago!!! I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THEY ARE MAKING THE MOVIE!!!!!! THIS IS GOING TO BE SO AWESOME.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaonce &#39;say something&#39; started playing...............chills man!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaOMG!   OMG!!! i&#39;m soooo exited! i read the books last year and it&#39;s AMAZING!! I can&#39;t wait until the movie comes out! :O :D
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaBooo another gay drama movie about shit that really doesn&#39;t matter
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaShe will be dead?
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really confused. Is she watching herself die?
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI seriously can&#39;t wait for this! I read the book and it was amazing! One of the best books I&#39;ve read so far :&#39;)
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitai love the cello music, and the movie gosh
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaits in theatres 2 days before my bday!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaomg it looks soo sweet and heart warming! sad true but beautiful to me &lt;3 i love stories like that
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s the lovely bones again omg this is so exciting
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it!!! why won&#39;t she just wake up ??!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting ever since I read the book three years ago for the movie to come out and now my favorite teenage/young adult actress is playing Mia <b>vibrates excitedly</b>
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaOOOH SNAP...
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI love films in this style, reminds me of the movie August Rush
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaOkay, this looks wonderful, but I could have SWORN Mia&#39;s best friend Kim was Asian. Not that I don&#39;t adore Liana Liberato, lovely and talented as she is I think she&#39;s going to go far, but seriously? I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I don&#39;t have the book on hand and Google&#39;s not helping so I can&#39;t confirm this. Can someone find Kim&#39;s description in the book for me please? If I&#39;m wrong I sincerely apologize.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps!!!!!!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t enjoy the book, but the movie looks promising!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaThe book was ok but I was impressed with &quot;Lovesong&quot;!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to it.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaAnd now I dont have to watch that movie. Thanks trailer people.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaGirl stuff..
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaMuy buen libro tengo muchas ganas de ver esta peli
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitai love chloe
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading the book right now. It&#39;s amazing.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaoh my god i read this book last december i loved it gahhh august get her alrady
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI think that&#39;s a good thing for Chloë to play this kind of role, not as always she does in horror movies or things like that. Hope this will be great like the book!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the cello song at the beginning please?? Thanks.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty bad... 
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaShould probably read the book before seeing this movie. Very intriguing.. And also really good with Warner bros. And Chloe as the leading role.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitachills
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaBook was beautiful just hope the movie is too.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s basically Ghost, but with the possibility of a happy ending.... go hollywood.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaThis book contains such delicate subject matter. This... makes me feel justified in the belief that it isn&#39;t going to be done justice. I wish this wasn&#39;t happening.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!! I just finished reading the if I stay series. If I stay and Where she went and it was totally awesome. Got me hooked reading pages by pages. Its cool to see the characters in flesh not just me having a visual/imagination of them. I would definitely watch this in theaters. I so love the trailer its perfect beyond words. Nice choice of music. Gaaah! I wish time could fly fast. 
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI think Chloe looks a little too young to play Mia, she&#39;s looks like she&#39;s 15 compared to the guy who&#39;s playing Adam, who looks like he&#39;s 18 or 19. Still looks like a good movie though, I loved the books!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI cry every time I watch this trailer but I can&#39;t stop watching it!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for the movie!!!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaWow, my birthday on August 22 &lt;3
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaomfg this movie is so my type of movie. I can&#39;t wait to see it. OH MY GOSH i already know this will make me cry
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI think Moretz is a poor choice for Mia :/ .....she&#39;s so annoying.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome:*)
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaQuando esce? <br>When this film go out in italy? 
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be the best birthday present ever.
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m waiting for someone to bust the end. 
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaDoes the first song have a name ? (The Cello part)
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaIf I Stay and Where She Went are my favorite novels of all time, but this movie doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s going to do the plot or characters any justice. 
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaOkay am watching it :-
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaOne of my fave actresses!<br>One of my fave songs!<br>One of my fave trailers!<br>Hopefully, one of my fave movies? <br>

m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaDoes someone know the name of the violins song played in the first half?
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaI love Chloe G! Can&#39;t wait to see this! She&#39;s my latest respected actress for damn sure!
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaAl fin :&#39;D hermoso libro :3
m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitai think it excellent

m9hZ40TJ0zsdelimeterByIshitaSo sad! Using my favorite song in the most appropriate part of this trailer is part of what makes this trailer unigue!

tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaYou think he&#39;s nuts until you see his sidekick😂
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaTakdomtakdombaja bajava gadhol
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHow can Brightburn exist in the same universe as this if people already know who Superman is?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaبله
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWe need Crimson Bolt vs Brightburn
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHow have I never heard of this before
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSooo this guy is gonna go toe to toe with brightburn?... HAHAHA rip...
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI’m here because of brightburn definitely not the same universe I hope not
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaخیلی خوبه
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThe one where Dwight became the head of sales.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDwight&#39;s about to be evil batman dressed as evil flash
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI loved Brightburn and Super! I hope the two main characters from each can one day meet. Even if it&#39;s just a cameo. I picture Crimson Bolt raising his wrench to Brightburn and saying, &quot;Shut up crime!&quot; Just to have Brightburn melt the wrench with his laser eyes, making Crimson Bolt run away in fear.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaGreatest &quot;superhero&quot; movie ever created. EDIT: what you are going on about that &quot;Brightburn&quot; pos. Nothing compared to this.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitai think this movie is the best super heros movie to this date
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaFor anyone thinking about seeing this movie after watching brightburn, I 100% recommend it. I believe this to be both a great Superhero movie and a amazing movie in general. Go watch it. It’s here on youtube, it’s on Netflix, it’s on DVD if you still have a DVD player, nothing’s stopping you.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThis trailer doesn’t do the movie justice 😭
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita<b>Brandon Breyer:</b> TAKE...THE... WOR-<br><br><b>Crimson Bolt:</b> SHUT UP, CRIME!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWas there more to the movie than the trailer shows? I mean if i saw the trailer, do i still need to see the movie?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSo he is suposed to defeat brandom?..
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHmm. A crimson bolt picture reference in the end credits of Brightburn. Interesting..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Gunn-verse confirmed.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaIs this footage when beard hunter are still active ?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSo this is the guy who is going to fight Brightburn
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita&quot;I knew i was losing her...MICHAEL!&quot;
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita&quot;Shut up, Crime&quot; sounds like something Dwight Schrute would say.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaworst movie I ever saw
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitawho else types super for some mk11 videos and this trailer always pops up
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaBefore Dwight, there was Super.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaIs this the hero we need to stop brightburn kid???? Find out next time on the office
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaTo everyone that’s seen Brightburn:<br><br><br><br>We’re all wondering it. How is Dwight gonna be able to fight Demon Superman?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitadwight
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaTo believe this is actually a prequel of sorts to Brightburn
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThe brightburn kid exist in this universe r.i.p.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThis is supposedly set in the same Universe as James Gunn&#39;s BrightBurn
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaAnyone here from Brightburn?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThe crimson bolt was on brightburn
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI wish James Gunn would make a sequel it should be about giving up the crimson bolt and since the death of his sidekick Frank moves to a new nicer town but then a crime lord comes to town 🦹‍♂️🗡🔫✊
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI&#39;&#39;d like to imagine it as a wes anderson movie with These Days at the background.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWatch this before Gunn&#39;s Suicide Squad.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThis was a brilliant movie. Love it.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaCuando sale? Okno
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita🤣
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitahe looks like a fake deadpool
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSuper
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDwight gone wild
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaLove this movie so much
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWho is here due to the tweets and firing of James Gunn?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita&quot;Shut up crime&quot;Every time that makes me laugh.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI love Ellen page such a good actor
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDwight’s life outside the office
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaGood film. Really
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHoly shit! Just watched it. That was some next level shit. Bravo.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLj_Bzw8n90&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a>?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI came to youtube to find some cool reviews and reaction videos and there is nothing. <br> This film was awesome, boltie was the best sidekick ever. =&#39;(
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song playing?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaJust finished watching The Office. Then watched this. Perfect. Dwight as a crime fighter. Needs more beets tho.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitathis reminds me of kickass....no that wasn&#39;t a criticism this looks better than I thought
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThey should do part 2
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSchrute!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI feel really bad for frank that I can’t stop thinking about it because I’m one scene it shows a flashback of his wedding and his reaction after him and Sara kissed is so sweet then I think about Sara betraying him and it is sad...
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI found this movie depressing
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita&quot;Some crazy motherfucker is going around whacking people with a pipe wrench!&quot;
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI actually really liked this movie. Its timing with respect to Kick Ass was unfortunate, as the two movies had nothing in common aside from a regular guy becoming a superhero. Ellen Page was fantastic in it.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWhats the two songs in thw trailer
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDwight !
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitayeah... this movie... it&#39;s all fun and games until someone gets shot in the head
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaTo think James Gunn directed this and the GOTG movies is insane!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI saw this through a random video how the hell haven&#39;t I heard about this I love the main characters type of comedy , did this movie bomb or something or do I just live in a cave.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaIt has to be good because Rainn Wilson acts in it.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaKick ass ?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI lost it when Libby died :l
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaWhat is the music at the beginning of the trailer ?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI SAW this MOVIE yesterday and it was AWESOME!!!👏👏👏👏👏
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaunderrated movie
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHey, Hollywood, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make more movies in the &#39;Super&#39;/&#39;Kick-Ass&#39; genre!!!!!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDwight k shrute
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes the movie look like an alternative kick ass, which it really is not.  Kick ass was still sent in a cartoonish world of good vs evil and happy endings where the hero gets the girl and the bad guys are vanquished.   There were no clear lines between good guys and bad guys in Super, just a struggle between naive fantasists and brutal realists.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaThis guy played a better Batman than Ben fucking Afflek, and its not even a fucking Batman movie!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaAbout the beginning of this movie, never listen against CCTDaily: <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-877315/the-truth-about-corporal-punishment-proof">http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-877315/the-truth-about-corporal-punishment-proof</a>
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaJust saw this and its awesome this guy its a Hero!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaFuck this Movie. !
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaEven with some plot holes, this movie was very satisfying !
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie and it was awesome...honestly better than kickass IMO love the way it shows the real struggle of how to fight crime 
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaBoltie was a little pyschopath
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaOMG it&#39;s Dwight Shrute lol
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita&quot;Don&#39;t molest kids!!!!&quot;  lol.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaFor all you lil fuck wits saying this is ripping off kick ass read the title you cunts 2010
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshita- Insert another random &quot;Rips off Kick Ass&quot; comment here -<br>I haven&#39;t seen this, but I&#39;m sure it is original in its own right, the 2 movies simply have similar ideas, an ordinary person wants to be superhero, to say that this movie is ripping off Kick Ass is to say that Battlefield is ripping off Call of Duty or something. So people, STAHHHP!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaKiss ass parody??
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaIn the movie she&#39;s 22
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitadwight
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaPut this man in kick ass 2
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitahe dies at the end
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaHmmm I&#39;m thinking kick ass!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s on film 4 tonight can&#39;t wait!!
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitathat was awesome 

tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaGreat Movie!!! Bloody as hell.
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitahow do you remember your username?
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaDON&#39;T MOLEST JKKIDS
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitathis came out first idiot
tLj_Bzw8n90delimeterByIshitaSHUT UP CRIME!!!!!!!
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaNo light 🕯️🚨🚨 on a train 🚃🚂🚂 it will be. A cell phone 🤳 away 😮
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaLove movie
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaPeople with epilepsy would love this trailer........
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaTHE TRAILER IS THE MOVIE
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaThis was a very bad movie lol
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaWhat a load of shit. Wish I didn&#39;t waste my time on this
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaThe psycho guy feed the monster
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaOmg what a freaking movie...  I think Bollywood has much more realistic and sensible movies.. <br>totally freaked out after watching this shit..
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaThis movie might have been taken more seriously and watched by alot more people if they would have come up with a more original title 😂
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaClive Barker is a genius! One of a kind! What a brilliant mind!
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI checked it out because it&#39;s been mentioned around lately (in videos of Bradley). I thought this was a comedy movie based on the title. 😅<br>Looks good though, just needed a more serious title.
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitajust heard of this today<br>looks sick
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;out of the furnace&quot; drive-in scene brought me here.
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this and it was lame as fuck!
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitait was a brilliant movie
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI watched this last night on Netflix - very suspenseful!!!!!!!!!
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie as a kid.
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching this at my sister&#39;s house right now!😦
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI read the title and thought this movie was going to be pure cheese, and then I watched the trailer and immediately recognized Bradly Cooper and Brooke Shields. The trailer looks good and the movie looks damn scary. Then I saw it was directed by Clive Barker. Now it&#39;s a must have. I just wish he picked a different title because I never would have stumbled upon it if I hadn&#39;t been sifting through all horror movies of 2008 on Google, determining which were good and which were crap.
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitai thought it was a gay porno
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitawhen did this movie come out?
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshita@maggot432 lool
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaI think they should abbreviate the name, because seriously? Midnight meat train? It&#39;s hilarious! 
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshita@DavetheCAFCAddick not a remake. A very different story. Trains are the only similarity.   
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaa scary porno?
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitaIN A WORLD OF TRAINS, THERE IS ONE MAN WHO WILL SAVE US. HES A PHOTOGRAPHER, SHES A WOMAN AND ONLY ONE ENGLISH GUY WITH A MALLET CAN STOP THEIR LOVE. THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN - COMING TO A TOP SHELF NEAR YOU.
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshita@murthaboy26 lol than i dont think you meant whack...?:P if it was so good :P
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshitathe narrator made the trailer sound gay
uZBObg2RS_IdelimeterByIshita@julids pussy
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWow just WOW!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaSituation like Thailand now
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIt was film in Thailand?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Malaysian. No Malay words seen or spoken in the trailer. Streets n sets look nothing like Malaysia. No one dressed like Malays. Cops/riot police look nothing like the uniforms in Malaysia. We use Roman alphabets for our language. I only c sanscript lookin words in the trailer. Could b Thai. Not sure tho 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitai feel like this movie was made to scare naive Americans from doing any business outside America... lol.. If it aint set in America or any friendly first world country... than that area will def want to kill you! 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWould have made more sense had it been set  in ISIS ruled territories.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitanice!!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know about this film it&#39;s just putting a bad representation on Southeast Asia ? 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaVietnamese flag @@
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t pass americam tourists in asian country, riots starts
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI think the director of this movie didn&#39;t specific where the exactly location is happened to avoid some conflict in reality. So they might mix up about detail and assume the new country in Asia as in the Trailer, I&#39;ve heard Thai sentence, but not familiar in message that attach with the cop&#39;s shields. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI must give respect to Owen for stepping away and actually acting for once.<br><br>HANSEL IS SO HOT RIGHT NOW
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaAt first I thought Owen Wilson looked miscast, but he looks good in this, and then Bond himself Pierce Brosnan, being an awesome older dude  who can kick ass, I&#39;m kind of interested in seeing this!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaLooks like Jyllands-Posten published a cartoon again.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI thought this was the Malaysian purge
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaYou want to go home? Then why go to the wrong place? Make this a lesson. Why are movies like this continuing to surface. This better not be one of those movies where the hero came from another place and saved the country....
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaLook like Thailand.....<br>อยากกกดูแฮะ!!!<br>คล้ายจะถ่ายในไทย แต่เนื้อหาล่อแหลมเกี่ยวกะการชุมนุมด้วย กลัวจะไม่ผ่านรัฐบาลไทยช่วงนี้อ่ะดิ
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaGlad Owen got his life together and is alive today, this movie looks good and good to see the old James Bond on the big screen it will be a good hit in the box office. Last year&#39;s movies kinda sucked with the insane comedies and horror.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaRwanda?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitasuperb movie trailer<br>rk
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThis movie has got my adrenalin pumping. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWhere exactly is this supposed to be?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIn the last scene -- just as all seems lost -- Team America shows up and rescues them.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWoah Owen Wilson in a serious role? 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOjj07EuO50&amp;t=1m31s">1:31</a> SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaokay owen wilson trying to be in a serious 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaits like dead island meets the purge
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaKhmer ROUUGGEEEE
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaOwen Wilson is back in action.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitafar cry 3 the movie
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaA bit of Max Payne 3.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIf hollywood replaced the rioting people with guns to zombies. You will have an awesome/epic zombie movie ever :D
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaCould have been good, if i didn&#39;t feel like i just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes.<br><br>I mean at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOjj07EuO50&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a>-45 you can all but tell it&#39;s the last thing that Pierce says to them. He sacrifices himself for the family. What a shock it&#39;ll be in the theater. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaTotally getting that &#39;Far Cry&#39; feel to this movie!  Can&#39;t wait to see it! 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaJust by seeing thr trailer its gonna be good
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshita:D its like Hotel Rwanda for white people!<br><br>Watch this energize people way more than Hotel Rwanda inspired anybody now that there&#39;s white stars. Just saying
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThat man got a choppa! On a choppa!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaAbout time Owen Wilson do some action movie!!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaLamo you just made my day
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitahopefully the family is not totally annoying and this could be good.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaOwen Wilson: cause no one would care if it wasn&#39;t a white family 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWith people saying this doesn&#39;t seem like an Owen Wilson role, it kind of makes sense because the character is in an unfamiliar situation.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI guess Monsieur Wilson has once again found himself....BEHIND ENEMY LINES 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI get the feeling that this will suffer from the same problem as The Impossible with Ewan McGregor. It&#39;s about white people, who will pretty much inevitably survive, and how they made it out while watching the thousands of nameless Asian people around them die. Just from this trailer, I pretty much know how this ends. The wife and kids live, Pierce Brosnan dies saving them, Owen Wilson might live.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s up with the Owen Wilson hate? So what he played in comedies mostly. He&#39;s an actor. I&#39;m sure he can do the job just fine. The trailer seems to show off he can. Just because you can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaHuge Brosnan fan. can&#39;t wait! 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaNothing good ever happens when you leave home. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitapierce brosnan yes own wilson not so 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWhyyyyy Owen Wilson on this movie...
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaTbh i think this kind of film would be better suited for liam neeson
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaHoly shit this looks good! Havent seen Pierce Brosnan or Owen Wilson in movies for a while.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitathe message of this movie is<br><br> : Don&#39;t move with your family to Thailand stay in the country where you are now (its the safest ! as long its NOT Iraq , Syria , Russia , Iran , Ukraine , North Korea , Afghanistan , Africa ,Gaza , Lebanon , Jordan ,Somalia ,Egypt
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitai thought he was only comedic......this looks like some Far Cry type shit
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaCame here to mock the trailer, ended up digging it. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaLOVE BEING AN ASIAN... wait am i bad?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaits about time Owen does any action movie after years and years and years of some what horrible comedies and lite indie films ..he needs to reintro himself to fans
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaPlot twist. Jackie Chan shows up and it&#39;s another Shanghai Movie!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really not a big fan of Mr. Wilson... Like cannot stand the guy... However. This looks awesome...
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWe all know Owen Wilson as a comedian, but i got to say.... honestly, for me, i think he stole the role....  and for that, i give him a lot more respect.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t worry,James bond will save the day
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaone of the best trailer I have ever seen after a long time
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaOsca?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaBehind Enemy Lines 2
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaNO ESCAPE BUTTON
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThis can be a great movie, but somehow I&#39;m not definitly over. However, it has my interests. And that&#39;s a positive thing I suppose. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThis should just be a FarCry movie﻿
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaDying Light: ISIS edition
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaPierce Bronson was the best James Bond. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaUA
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaMalasya !!! They are one of the most friendly people on the planet to tourists, as 90% of their economy comes out of it. Rivalled only by the Philipinos !! If it was in Taiwan, I would belive, because of the recent civil unrest there, but even so, no such cases of open civil war were recorded. This movie is very fictional, and gives a bad name to wonderful countres like Malasya, its almost criminal.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaFar Cry 5?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaawesome\
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t see Owen WIlson in an action thriller since Behind Enemy Lines. This looks really promising and riveting.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThe unofficial sequel to Behind Enemy Lines. Looks decent
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI LOVE IT
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIts seems like odd casting, but ill give em the benefit of a doubt.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWhy is this movie disguising itself to be a horrormovie so badly? The soundassets, every horror movie used for the last 10 years, the transition screens in this rusty, bloody texture, the slow down, speed up of the music right before the slow piano piece? Why? This looks like a descent enough movie. Or did the editor do it by mistake? This is so weird.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaAnyone have the song name?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWorld war Z in a different form. Disappointed.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaOwen Wilson in a really good movie! It was about time! 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaBehind Enemy Lines:  Southeast Asia....  featuring  James Bond
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaReminds me alot of far cry 3 actually, looks like owen wilsons character need to transform and adapt to a warrior to save his family and survive, stuck between two factions... might be decent.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitait looks good but coulda been way better if they cast a better actor in the lead role. 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaHow do you not research a country before you move there?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not Owen Wilson you should worry about, it&#39;s the shitty director of As Above So Below
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m liking the location.... Its not the middle east
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI actually really want to see this now lol that was a good trailer!!!
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaTrailer showed too much AGAIN
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThis just looks like World War Z without the zombies <br>-Well known early 40&#39;s actor<br>-Wife, 2 kids, both girls<br>-Everything changes in a street<br>-Race the top if hotel for safety <br>-Male character wears a scarf <br>-Hordes of angry humans<br> 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWhat is he doing in Asia?
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI would see this.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaWOW, that actually looks impressive
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaIts like a Far cry film
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThailand? This must be si-fi movie. Thai people is like super friendly. And the Korean just stabbed  American ambassador.
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaHe was good in behind enemy lines, so hes capable
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitalooks meh
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitano offence but the amount of comedies owen wilson has made i really cant take him seriously 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaI would go to Taco Bell 
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaThat children laugh track is OVER USED !
DOjj07EuO50delimeterByIshitaOwen Wilson is not suited for this movie.

bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaThank you.. love the movie.. funny
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitawhen Captain America, Falcon &amp; Starlord are stucked up in a romantic comedy not by Marvel Studios
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome as all the cast.
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaBest movie ever. Only bc Chris Evans is in it😂😍👌🏻
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaI should rewatch this!
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaIM LAUGHING CAUSE ANTHONYMACKIE AND CHRIS EVANS
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaSo this is what Captain America, Starlord, Falcon, Spock, Bilbo Baggins and Jake Peralto all did before they started saving the world.
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaI have no idea how I missed this movie, it actually looks really funny!
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitawas <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgkxGrsX-A4&amp;t=1m16s">1:16</a> in the movie?

bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaI want to watch this but im afraid im going to dislike her as shes not Natasha Romanoff and ROMANOGERS IS LIFE!!!
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaI love this movie but I had no idea at the time that Chris Pratt is married to Anna in real life. I screamed when my friend told me and re watched it with a whole new respect for their professionalism as actors
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaI just realised that the storyline is kinda similar to the movie Baggage Claim ? lol trying to track down past lovers (both have a black guy in politics as one of them), sisters wedding, and ending up w/ the guy who lives in the apartment opposite ? I still love this move tho (:
bgkxGrsX-A4delimeterByIshitaWhen both Cap and Falcon are in the movie

PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitawow completely AMAZING
Breath Breathtakingly AWESOME!!!!
MY breath was taken away 
Pre-odering my Tickets like NOW!!!!
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaHOPEFULLY THE WORLD WILL END BEFORE THIS MOVIE STARTS 
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaOh my jizzus i wasnt really a big twilight fan but damn this reminds me of the book 
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaI died....Best trailer yet!!! And think BD part 1 will be the best of 3. IT LOOKS AMAZING. These movies just keep getting better and better. There are no words to describe how excited i am!! Midnight showing here I am ready for ya! :D 
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshita1:04 - &quot;last night was the best night of my excistence&quot; &lt;3
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitajust like the book! thank god!!! It looks epic! i knew thats how they were going to part the movie. I bet this movie will end with bella about to give birth or already given birth. Im pretty sure the next one will be how rennesme grows up and the volturi part. EPIC
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshita@dloquetepierdes para que ves el trailer entonces ?
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaMelhor de todos!
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaOMG YES!!!! 
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshita2:08 *sniffles* That snippet of Charlie broke my heart.

PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitawaiting for that abortion scene
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaOMG OFFICIALLY cannot wait ... can&#39;t stop watching..... amazing and u know i think this will be the best yet... i love it :D hurry up november
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaEdward Cullen.. nuff said. 

This trailer made my heart rate go up 95%.
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitai wasn&#39;t expecting much considering the complete lack of plot, but this looked half good. not midnight premeire worthy, but maybe that weekend :)
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not a huge fan anymore, but they make a crappy storyline look pretty epic. The acting looks better in this one. I love Rob and Kris, but always in other things and not Twilight, however I feel they got a little more chance to prove themselves in this. I actually squeed out loud after seeing this like the former fan I was. :3
PQNLfo-SOR4delimeterByIshitawhy is there a dislike button on this vid?. shame.
THIS IS THE BEST TRAILER OF THE WHOLE SERIES &lt;3

urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaOne of the saddest best acted movies!
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaEsta película es simplemente arte, muchos filmes modernos tratan de evocarte miedo, tristeza y terror de diferentes formas en diferentes formatos, pero siempre es la misma estupida forma previsible y sonsa, pero este filme es espectacular en todo, transmite todo tipo de emociones sin caer ridiculeces del tipo fantaseoso para contartelas, pura y dura realidad, este es el tipo de películas que deberían ser reconocidas y referentes mundiales no otra estupidez de Marvel sobre el héroe venciendo al malo por millonésima vez, en la vida real nunca vences a nada ni nadie, no te es posible.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaLizzo
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaWatching Sidibe in this is f**king heartbreaking.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaOnly watched once. Very good. Monique definitely deserved that Oscar.

urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaYea
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaThis is the saddest story
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaWhile Im at it...<br><a href="https://youtu.be/bLJHpwpdBlk">https://youtu.be/bLJHpwpdBlk</a>
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaUma pessoa que passa pelo que a preciosa passou e não fez nada com a sua própria vida, é a pessoa mais forte que existe Só Deus pra colocar pessoas boas que não desiste de nós <br>Preciosa teve ajuda muitos na vida real não tem 😭
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaNão tenho coragem de assistir 🥺😭
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaNever did watch this movie but I came to see the trailer with all of this stuff that’s been going on with Monique😳😢🤦🏽‍♀️
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaI just had to come check out the movie after the DL Hughley and  Monique drama
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaEs una película , y muy buena <br>En ocasiones la realidad supera la ficción <br>Es muy fuerte pero es la vida<br>Y más a más como hablamos de una película es más conveniente vasarla en una familia de color pero por desgracia enla vida real y en familias de otro color pasa y mucho<br>No quiero ser tikimiki<br>Muy buena chapó
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaمسكينة ها الدبة تحزن
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitawhat a bummer of a movie
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaI feel bad for her :(
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaPrecious
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFY3jp759c&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a> when I saw Precious being pushed I was worried about the baby.  Was she pregnant at this scene before or after it was discovered? Haven’y watched the movie yet nor read the book.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaI saw this film years ago when it first came out. It&#39;s one of those hunting films that leave residuals in your mind.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshita✨✝️✨I feel for the actual lady, that suffered so much harmed, in the hands of her own parents, getting rape, beating, physically assaulted etc., As well as Precious the actress.,
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaI like some of your comments on this, it is a serious film if you liked this go listen to a track called drug abuse you should find it on my playlist seeing as i made it, but that is waiting for your honest opinions movie coming as soon as we find the right director, the guy who directed this film is in my top 10 / top 5 and i want to know why the film was set in 1987?? That would be a question to ask the director or the writer Hhmmmmm
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaLa expresión facial de Precious, de irritabilidad, es tan bien lograda que realmente transmite el hastío que sentía por toda su situación de vida. Debió de haber merecido el Oscar.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaHas anyone read the sequel about her son Abdul. It starts at Precious&#39;s funeral when he&#39;s 9 and all these ppl are there remembering his mom. Then he is pretty much made ward of the state. How does Abdul&#39;s life turn out?? Let me just warn u...It&#39;s one of the most horrifying stories I&#39;ve ever read.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaEste filme eh da hora. Uma voadora na alta sociedade burgesa branca q se acham donos do pedaco.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaI dont think its possible to watch this without tearing up. I&#39;m a little nervous to see the movie
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaPoverty and abuse, what a horrible life
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaСупер
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaWhat if Clareeice get&#39;s a baby since If it&#39;s a boy or a girl?
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaThose 43 are dumbasses who dislike this feeling 🙄

urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaThe sequal book to the book of this movie   follows the life of Precious&#39; son Abdul from the age of nine to 19. Precious herself pretty much dies of complications from HIV, but was accepted to college before her death 😓😓😓
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaGot this on audiobook.

urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaDoes this remind anyone else of the fake trailer &#39;American Dad!&#39; did on the Tearjerker episode, with Oscar Gold?
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaPrecious take those kids and raise them up. There are no mistakes here. Don&#39;t turn your back on them. They can give you strength in so many ways. You never know which child will be your savior one day.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaNever heard of this film before (in UK) but saw it on Netflix and thought &#39;there&#39;s no way Monique couldn&#39;t have won an Oscar for her performance&#39; Glad to learn that she did, because that would&#39;ve been a travesty if she didn&#39;t.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitawhich is the scene precious and monique fight over the last slice of cake???
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaIs that Young Chop ?
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitaMariah Carey is fucking amazing
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitathis is just a movie based off a book so those saying its based off a true story ,STFU.
urFY3jp759cdelimeterByIshitathis movie is very sad... can you imagine how lonely people like this feel...kids make friends with the lonely kid, brighten up their day and yours will shine...

zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaawesome cant wait!!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis is basically Pitch Dark with more action...

Looks like quite a shit.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a sequel , it&#39;s a remake of pitch black , or something like that?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Alien vs Predator: Riddick style
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so small. Aren&#39;t sequels supposed to be bigger than the original? 
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaOr too much
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitathey all died
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis does look pretty Shit they will never make one better than the chronicles of riddik
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThat is deliberate.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSTAAARRRBUCCCCKKK!!! 0:33
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitabecause of movies like this i know 90&#39;s-00&#39;s movies by heart
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFinally
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t stop reading things like: &quot;This movie will be awesome&quot;. Really? REALLY?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaPff!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitalike pitch black same scenario,,   verry dissepointet i am
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaToo bad the second one was a major fail at the box office, &#39;cause now they have a lot less money for this one and it shows. So much for seeing Riddick taking the head of Necromongers and conquering the galaxy. Now they have to go Pitch Black all over again.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFinally Cant Wait! 


zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaHell yeahhh you are on my list now Riddick
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaLooks sweet but there&#39;s alot of rain
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so tits
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this movie has no plot
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the most CGI movie in the history of CGI movies.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaUmmm didnt Riddick have an entire army at his command end of last movie? WTF happened? Its suddenly turned into the 1st film again.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaYeeesssss!!!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a Remake, but better :D
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitahe is supposed to be in the movie, but he just isn&#39;t in the trailer
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaVin Diesel , Katee Sackhoff and Batista.. SOLD
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitasuper to long wait this film :)
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitadid you totally miss the necromonger in the trailer?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFor being on a very tight, indie type, budget, they&#39;ve done a very great job. Its nice to see a return of Riddick
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitawheres karl urban then?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFinally all the things I like about Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick put into one film.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFAST AND FURIOUS 37!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaI was going to say that..........
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaMeh

zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about. damn. time.

Necromonger blade @1:15

Johnny Tapia don&#39;t want no work...silly Merc
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaKarl Urban is in this?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaLooks alright, like the world of Riddick. Its kinda MadMAX in space.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaAfter. I read somewhere that the Necromongers double cross Riddick and dump him on this planet.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitasick!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitawhy? We already saw it.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaWe all may disagree with a lot of things, but one thing we can agree on is that Vine Diesel is a badass!!!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaWell I pretty much just saw the whole movie right there
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaStarbuck kicking ass, yeah!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSee this movie early at probablyloadedwithviruses.co
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaoh my god this movie will be awsome
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaYou can see necromonger at 1:04 and their weapon at 1:17.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaFucking same story line as the first riddick-head movie
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitasoooo is he not going to be involved with the necromongers???
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshita&quot;watch out for surprise attacks&quot; how will you watch out for something you wont see coming?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaRiddick 3
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaooooooo he is back
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know about you guys, but i don&#39;t see me no Karl Urban

zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitagood to see starbuck is alive and well...
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaWell that was a great movie! Kinda short but great use of special effects ;)
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshita@konnman......I agree
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an update to Pitch Black because in that one he started as a prisoner. Even if it is an update, I can&#39;t wait to see. Vin Diesel is a man of action.

Nother thing, where is Karl Urban in this trailer? I didn&#39;t see him.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaAwesome!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaeven though this is the 3rd Riddick film this looks alot like the first movie.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks Riddickoulous
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaholy  fucking   shit
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s basically a remake of the first one... with updated graphics and new, disposable characters added for fun kills.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaYeah, so true!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaPitch Black atmosphere detected! :D AWESOME!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaNow this IS the sequel to Pich Black :)
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitanice thanks for clearing that up
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaGoing to wait and see it at home on TNT or something...
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThey left him on this planet, and Vako is their leader now... :)
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSo the whole movie will be fighting on a desert planet, where vin is in predator role?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThis kinda reminds me of pitch black, can&#39;t wait to see this.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitasequels happened
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshita&#39;Johnny&#39; Tapia, haha
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaso what happened to being the leader of a massive necro monger army?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSTARBUCK!!!!!!!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitathis mercs never learn hahahaha
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSTARBUCK
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaPitch black all over again, and this is the fourth movie in the series for those of you that don&#39;t know
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitayes and between pitch black and chronicles of riddick there is an animated movie called The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, also i recommend u the games if u want to know a little bit more about riddick.. (The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena)
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaEven though I&#39;m excited, this still looks just like a redone version of Pitch Black...almost exactly the same plot and everything.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaTerrible trailer
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshita1:52 Dave Batista! LOL Hell yeah!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaThanks for giving away all the movie. 
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaDamn the black dude died in the trailer lmao
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaWell I think I&#39;ve seen the whole movie now.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaRiddick vs Aliens. lol. EPIC.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaRID-DICK HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaVin Diesel sounds like a crossover between Rambo and Batman.
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaPitch Black is the first movie? Chronicles of Riddick the second and this the third?

zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaStarbuck!!!!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitasweet!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSimilar to Pitch Black
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaSo this is before the last movie?
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaOk so now I know the whole movie
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaEPIC!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaOuuuuuuu yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaAll story in 1 trailer
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaWhat a shit...
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaBack to the roots!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaExcited that Katee is kicking ass in this. The Queen of Schmoeville!
zH3O-CeZckEdelimeterByIshitaYES
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaJust go to Madagascar.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaBoring...
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita1918 Spanish flu and H1N1 Hybrid has been released.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaHahaha, Gwyneth dies
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another virus from Ft. Dix.....
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitagod i love matt damon
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@jugger74 true but how do you know that govt said to make this movie
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaIs this set in Hong Kong??
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of the TV movie called &quot;Fatal Contact, Bird Flu in America&quot; from 2006. Or &quot;Outbreak&quot; from 1995, and several others.  New movie, old meme.  They&#39;re just capitalizing on the current rage of armageddon type themes.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaJulia Gillard and the Greens suck ass!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThe world is becoming way over populated and eventually nature will form a super virus to kill most people so the Earth can continue living and the few people who survive. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@SoSoRandom123, I think the National Party will win the New Zealand election.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@Hellke mythology? the two are different idiot...Religion is commonly defined as belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or divine, and the moral codes, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief.Robert Segal, professor of theories of religion at the University of Lancaster, defines myth&quot;broadly as any story whose &quot;main figures are personalities divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Platos Good, and yes i copied that from wikipedia :D
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI hope Matt Damen dies not long after the woman he&#39;s yelling about.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@BiscuitBumington Christianity divides us more than any other war or goverment ever did. You are exactly where &quot;they&quot; want you to be. Close minded and fanatic believer of a mythology.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThe fuck are you talking about propaganda? It&#39;s a fucking movie, you idiots. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaIm glad to see that people really see this for what it is. Just your average government fear tactics/propaganda bullshit.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaDisgusting government propaganda. This stuff is becoming so obvious. ‘Don’t touch anyone, don’t talk to anyone...’. They are trying to drive us apart and make us forget we are a united race under one God. The last thing they want is for us to realize our power and come together against the evil Luciferian elite. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaWhere are the mutant birds? I want mutant birds damn it!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaStupidity should be very painful
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI think I&#39;ll watch it looks pretty good. One problem for me though, Gwyneth dies and I am a huge fan. O well. ( I prob will get a lot of &quot;bleck Gwyneth but whatever)
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI love Propaganda. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@jugger74 it&#39;s a movie relax
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaAnyone here ever heard of a little director named Steven Soderbergh? The guy who made a 6 hour film about Che for no money, Traffic about the arbitrary process of drug control and distribution and Erin Brokovich about a small town that was destroyed by bacteria in the water. I think the guy has no interest in propaganda and has some talent as a director/cinematographer(which he does on all his films). Get over yourselves.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@FreeBirdInc 
One made by Mel Brooks.......you&#39;re on to something here !
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaPandemic the Movie.
I bet Madagascar will be the last one standing.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@ClementineRoad 

Wow... the luciferian elite?  Really?  Tell me more about this evil cabal, oh wise one.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@UssjTrunks1030
I thought the same thing. Bummer.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaPropaganda. Fear. Garbage. In film format. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone here ever see that &quot;Mother Goose &amp; Grimm&quot; where the audience was leaving a theater showing &quot;OUTBREAK&quot;, &amp; then someone sneezes  ? Then everyone around him parts like the Red Sea. It would really be funny to fake a coughing fit during this flick halfway through.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re trying to force high school students to take the whooping cough shots again before they register for school next year.What they don&#39;t tell the parents they can just sign a waiver if they choose not to take the shot.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThe (north) americans are so paranoics (never do anything about it, thought), but when we have a medical trouble we need them to solve it...

Now you tell me its unreliable?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaPropaganda film to get the H1N1 shot.  They could kill 2 birds with one stone by blaming this on Osama.  Maybe during the panic they could have everyone willingly give up their freedoms and weapons.  Hell they could make so much predictive programming with this it wouldn&#39;t even be funny.  FEMA camps SAVE! LOL
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@ericallen1000 The only difference is that Steven Soderbergh is doing it.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitais this the T-virus from resident evil?

4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaAn excuse to pump people with more MERCURY containing vaccines. The 20th century was the century of the lie. So many people were brain washed by the propaganda that Fluoride was good for you and that you needed to get your Flu vaccinations. Hollywood has always been just another extension of the oligarchs media control grid. If people don&#39;t buy this, they will develop a weaponized version just to coerce everyone.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like an awesome film. Everything is not a freak&#39;in conspiracy people. Take your meds and enjoy a damn movie.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@btdarcy911 how the hell would you know?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in this film wooohooo!!!!!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis is another &quot;Revelation of the Method&quot; dissemination by the NWO elitists to the public.


4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@fistfullofhope, I never understood Lautner.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaevery actor in Hollywood must be paid for with our tax dollars courtesy of the of united states of using fear to control  
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@InterllectualBADASS 
yeah: Matt Damon=fail.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t stand Damon, so won&#39;t see it. Anyone who is into history revision and impressed/influenced by Howard Zinn, is no friend of mine.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look too bad! Gwyneth Paltrow dies &amp; the TSA are apparently outta work :)
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaBad editing.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitazzz another Hollywood propaganda flick for Big Pharma
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis was made because the government and the pharmaceutical couldn&#39;t pump out enough fear based propaganda last time so now they&#39;ve enlisted Hollywood to throw their shine on it. We all know the majority of the dumbed downed masses get their science related info from movies. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaCheck the flu vaccines.  Thats where she got sick.  Sorry to spoil the ending
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLame.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaWhat is a WIFE &amp; MOTHER doing all alone in Hong Kong? Looks like the slut had it coming!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaYour wife is now a vegetable.  She will require round the clock observation for the rest of her life......... Bwahahahahahaha, Just kidding, I almost had you there huh?? No really, she&#39;s dead.

4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaSame ol&#39; recycled plot.  I have a book (I believe it was Outbreak) that is along the same lines.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@SoSoRandom123, I didn&#39;t see Gweneth come back to life - I don&#39;t think this is a zombie movie.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@fistfullofhope, surely you must agree Twilight is stupid?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@nickzaneaw - So we have another ultra-leftist, ideologically and philosophically extremist, who continually develops enough conspiracy theories to develop thousands of novels of material that lacks concrete and substantial evidence.  Organizations and publications such as &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;The Skeptic&#39;s Dictionary&quot; (that had published &quot;Debunking 9/11 Myths&quot;) and even &quot;The National Geographic Channel&quot; have proven these theories ineffective.  
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaMaaaan who&#39;s the douche bag? Bein&#39;  liberal doesn&#39;t make you an unequivocal douche bag...not like bein&#39; a conservative republican does anyway...
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis would work much better as a parody.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most effective way to reduce the population..You dont need to waste your time looking at vaccines. They cost way to much money. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI remember when this was called &quot;Outbreak&quot;.

I guess Hollywood really has run out of ideas.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re all gonna die!  Again ...
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it will be a good movie,especially with the cast in it.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaAnother virus movie. Will they ever stop?!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@whitesoxbuff : HA HA HA H AHA H!!! Right?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaWhy do I find movies like this so irresistible...
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaoutbreak 2: Electric Boogaloo
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s kinda like more cool version of OUTBREAK isn&#39;t it?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitai thought this would be a zombie movie :( it&#39;s a simple virus that kills, big woop. Nothing exciting

4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI thought Soderbergh quit movies ?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaI think the trailer just give away the BIGGEST SPOILER
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaShit like this genuinely scares me  : /
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@TheTrailerCREAT0R I know man I was just pulling your leg :) Film looks good though
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaOne hell of a cast!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaOutbreak pt 2
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaOne word, Purell!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitauhchh..I think I just dropped a deuce in my boxers... 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@rubioproductions Its classified as action/thriller not a horror film. Zombie films are automatically classified as horror. Plus is Steven Soderbergh Directing this the guy who directed and wrote all three Ocean 11,12,13 films and Bourne Ultimatum am pretty sure he wont pull some dumb ass twist like that.   As for Mutation it  is a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene. This happens with any kind of virus what do you think your DNA stays the same? 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaseems great, and the cast is awesome.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@TheTrailerCREAT0R it may not seemed but i bet it will turn out to be a zombie film ;) Clues on the trailer - theyre mutating ;)
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaWanted to watch this because of the cast, but after seeing the trailer I&#39;m not so sure. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshita@rubioproductions no its not wtf? lol
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaits a zombie film yay!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaFirst film released in theaters that was entirely shot using RED EPIC 5K camera. 

Looks gorgeous. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait !
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaCould be interesting.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaits nice seeing Gwyneth Paltrow looking not amazingly beautiful for once :D

My bonus!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis IS NOT a ZOMBIE FILM 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaMovie Fail 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThis will be a different virus movie because of the excellent Steven Soderbergh directing and Oscar Winnning and Nominated cast. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks boring!  How many times can Hollywood make a movie about a virus outbreak? Different cast same formula :(
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaZOMBIES???? WHERE are THEY?!?!?!


4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitabringing out the O word I am thinking at least one of them will get an Oscar nomination for this.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaThey aren&#39;t zombies?
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaGod Damn!!! How many Oscar winners/nominees are in this film?! Marion, Kate, and Laurence should be wonders to watch but they should have replaced Matt Damon with somebody like Brad Pitt or Clive Owens or Christian Bale. 
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaright corner, the apple picture - REMOVE THAT!
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitathis looks like an ok movie
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitai m so glad that kate is playing quite different role from the rolls she did before.just waiting for this movie like anything.

4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaIf the Apocalypse does come, I really think it would be because of a Super Virus, rather than stupid zombies.
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaToo many good actors  , wasted in what looks like just a sub par movie
4sYSyuuLk5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good movie ^^

cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaOoooooooooookay. Easy on the crazy.
cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaYou are a terrible liar.

cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitalool...fruit ninja
cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaYou do realize it&#39;s played at a WHOLE bunch of festivals right??
cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaThe screenwriter, Chris Galetta ,was my professor in uni and his hometown in Staten Island got to be one of the first places to screen it. :)
cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaINCREDIBLE film. I&#39;m so surprised it has an &quot;R&quot; rating. Honestly, this movie doesn&#39;t deserve it. I&#39;d take all of my family and then some to see this film again. The most fun I&#39;ve had-- dyyyyyyyyying laughing. :D Chris Galetta&#39;s writing is flaw-free. And the casting and cinematography turned this film into... the best memory of my year, so far. 
cLnAiVI4R2QdelimeterByIshitaLooks great! Anyone know the name of the song?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaFrom the cover I always thought the film was like The Beach or Swept Away. When I later read a plot synopsis I learned it was actually a drama about the inheritance of an estate, like Downton Abbey or something. Now I&#39;ve seen the trailer I&#39;m again baffled and still none the wiser.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThe best scenes in this movie were with Syd. The biggest jackass in it was the grandfather.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitala veré
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaWho is the music that starts at minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDwUH02DDWU&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a>?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great 🎭 🎰
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI really appreciate the trailer for telling me at least 75% of the movie and I can just warp the ending and no longer have to watch it.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSuch a GREAT MOVIE!  Really really great!  Love it!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI think this is the best work in Clooney&#39;s life. It&#39;s a great job of the great actor and producer. And 11 years i watch this movie every month. Thank you, George.<br>Victor. Russia. Saint-Petersburg.<br>I really believe, that one time i will get to this place to honor the memory of this actor and film
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaCinemaScope in Color by Technicolor
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I watch the full movie?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaGREAT MOVIE...<br>We lived on Oahu now Mainland. Really thought the writers were spot on with local customs
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI spent a week before New Years visiting in Hawaii with my b.f.  who was living there for a few months surfing. Mostly, I spent my days w/ neighbors black Labrador on the beach. He was always busy w/his friends so I just minded myself. On New Years eve he invited me to a island party but said &quot; I don&#39;t think you&#39;d like it&quot; so I said cool I&#39;ll stay here with &quot;Blacky&quot; my new found dog friend. After this trip I realized if you have bad instincts in a relationship, JUST RUN. If they are incapable of feelings, that will never never change. I PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO ALL ANIMALS whom have loved me for who I am, a really nice cool person who by the way can surf.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorites.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitathey always make latino characters the laughing stock of hollywood
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI Don&#39;t Know Why I Didn&#39;t Watch This up To Now! It Was So Good! The acting was phenomenal, the storyline was great! I totally enjoyed this movie so much I am surprised that I had waiting in my inbox for so long without watching it. God bless you , and Be safe
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has such advanced humor for 2011 it’s kinda unbelievable
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI loved it... Great movie, amazing acting and stunning &amp; wonderful soundtrack
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSpeaking as someone who grew up and lived on Maui for 25 years, I can attest that, at least in capturing the essence of daily life in Hawaii…..the dress, the casual nature, the house decorations, the goat in the front yard, the yard plants, the opening of the neighbor’s door and simply walking in as if it’s your own home, the general laid back vibe of local and island culture…..they absolutely nailed it. Sid, especially, was an accurate casting….he reminds me of more than a few local kids at my high school. <br><br>It is a surprisingly accurate representation of what life in the islands actually feels like. Whenever I’m asked what living in Hawaii is like I always refer to this film, as while there are nitpicks here and there, for the most part it gives a very good general gist. The only notable thing I would say is the local slang and pidgeon has been largely toned down, but that’s understandable in consideration of accommodating a broader audience who would be left clueless. But otherwise, you can tell they had a local advisor in their employ, and not someone who was operating on what they assumed living there was like, but who actually did.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThe names!?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaHawaii is such a beautiful place!!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThe tables were turned. Everybody hates mom for what she did. Hard to watch everybody hate somebody for 1 indiscretion.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this! Good movie 👏🏻💝
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaIt is Drama and Comedy at the same time.<br>It is a great movie. I didnt expect it is great like this. It’s hilarious and touching. A very well-made movie!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis should be called the Deancendents....
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s rated R.... You saying it should&#39;ve been rated M?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaWell i dont need to watch it anymore, such a good trailer
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaA MASTERPIECE! In every way.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI liked it that was a good very relaxing kinda movie...Clooney and rest of the Hollywood crowd should just do entertainment and give people good times not involve with politics at least not in a hardcore way
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaYou stole a bands name
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie :)

XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaIkr it’s like decendants Disney channel like mal and malafiscint idk Wht to call it’s like malafiscint is a mom of mal
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSuch a GREAT movie! The writing and cast are just top notch, it&#39;s able to pack a emotional punch and yet also can like be light and so hilarious!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Shout up, you motherless whore!&quot;<br>😂😂😂😂😂<br>Always makes L.O.L
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitamy type of movie, it&#39;s relaxing but you get inspiration from it
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaYou cheated on Bruce Wayne and got seduced by shaggy, come on
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaBonne histoire, bons acteurs, musique inoubliable. 👍👍👍
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was streets ahead
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing clips about it when I was younger so I decided to start looking for it and it is this, not 100 sure where to watch it tho
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshita&#39;The Descendants&#39; Director Accused of Sexual Misconduct by Rose McGowan.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSomehow,they make Hawaii look kinda melancholic...
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitagood movie.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitawhen the movie first came out i thought it was boring and would fast forward to the parts where shailene woodley is in a bikini and beat off. After watching it again 8 years later i think its a pretty good movie
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis is deantastic
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie. It’s so crazy, but you just go along. When I first saw this, I couldn’t relate to why they were sad, yet angry at her. But now, I lost someone a while back now and at first, I was glad they died. They were awful to me, but then, they were very caring to others. It was complicated and still is. I’m glad they can’t cause any pain to me, but I’m also sad that they can’t care for others anymore. Death is complicated, but death is still death.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaLife as a house is also great
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThe music for the trailer is horrible. The movie is a fucking masterpiece though.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaWhenver i want to feel peace in life, i watch this movie alone.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaRIP CAMERON BOYCE ❤️❤️❤️
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally one of my favorite movies ever. If you&#39;re reading this and wondering if you should check it out, check it the hell out. Because it&#39;s worth every second. It&#39;s hilarious and will also probably make you cry.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaWhen u trying to find this trailer but you get Disney’s Descendants instead 😐💀
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie. Exceed my expectations since this trailer looked All hovey dovey.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaLookz lame as fuk
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaBrah wat is this shit?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was far more depressing than I expected.  The trailer makes it look somewhat lighthearted and funny but I found it very sad.  It&#39;s been a while since I watched it but I haven&#39;t been able to make myself watch it again so maybe I would have a different opinion now.  The backdrop for the film was fantastically beautiful, of course!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaHeck yeah, last song is Blue Skies by Noah And The Whale!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaBeat movie ever!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading the book. I just looked this up now lol
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS MOVIE.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThey fucking spoiled the movie in the trailer
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaThis isn’t about a punk band.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitagreat movie bad trailer
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaI just got the book and so far it is good which is why I decided to look up the movie and now I can&#39;t wait to finish reading it and watch the movie
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaIs there any good movie shot in Hawaii like this one ? Because i really loved the ambiance!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitathis movie is underrated
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitagood movie but the soundtrack is insane.  slack key masters on full display.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshita<b>If it&#39;s not enough for you that the only thing that you know for sure that you exist in this moment,</b> check out &quot;The Truth Contest&quot; -website and open &quot;The Present&quot; -ebook there. <i>The Real Truth of Life has been unveiled.</i><br> <br> 
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaSerisouly... who would cheat on George Clooney with Shaggy? come on!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshita This film is bleak and depressing and creepy, how the man involves his kids in his wifes affair- keep your sex life private.  Very weak effort.  
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who&#39;s watching random movie-trailers?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitawhat are the songs called in this??
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaMore appropriate title: 

FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshita@wangmary that&#39;s why this movie should be in the scifi category...
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaum...who would cheat on george clooney?
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaGeorge Clooney is starring in The Descendants December 2011  in theaters worldwide filmed at Tahiti Nui Hanalei Town North Shore Kauai Surfing Town USA thanks mahalo.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitalooks great! awesome that noah and the whale was in the trailer.
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitawho the man??? GEORGE CLOONEY  is the MAN!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaim so gonna watch this movie!
XDwUH02DDWUdelimeterByIshitaneed to put it in my movie list
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaSaw this to it was good but different the way it ended but loved the beginning and the soundtrack.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshita8 years ago. I’m almost 26 and I remember my older sister watching the tv shows thinking it was weird but here I am trying to catch up for And just like that!! P.s Happy to see Aiden Loved him but Big will always have my special place in my heart ♥️
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaMrs . Parker is , honestly, ugly woman…That huge nose and small, narrow eyes…😏
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaSATC 3: Rat King vs Dickbot
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaShe still had feelings for Aden..
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitai miss this era. i am still this. i loved the one when she shagged a younger guy. i had the same thoughts in the same situation. my generation is so hard done by! we dont even have the money they did back then. sad.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI love the beginning of this trailer!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaJust remember, a REAL company lost REAL money because a FICTIONAL character had a heart attack on their exercise bike in this show.<br><br>But damn if the girls didn&#39;t enjoy their time in the United Arab Emirates!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaShown in:<br>Dear John <br>Valentine’s Day<br>Date Night<br>Robin Hood
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitachrist this movie sucks
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaCarrie’s character makes no sense in that movie. The way she complains about big’s shoes, how she rearranges the curtains. That’s nothing like her. And her tacky over the top appartement, fashion is so tacky too….the New York realism of the great original series died for good here. Too much fresh new money doesn’t always look good in the wrong hands.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitathis was low-key disasterous.  They should have stopped here.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE this movie. Even though I secretly do not admire Samantha — which makes her an excellent actress!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI feel like Kim made a huge effort here to act natural due to her profound dislike for her coworkers.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThey always pick gorgeous men for Samantha. wow, good taste.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaKim Cattrall still looks stunning here. Omg.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m sorry, but I think these movies outside of the show are just money grabs. They wanted to have a 3rd. What for?
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY7sAJm8Fuk&amp;t=0m27s">0:27</a>
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY7sAJm8Fuk&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a>
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaOK that&#39;s what I missed. This movie was meant to be watched in low resolution
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaIf I was Kim Cantrell I wouldn’t do anything after this movie. The cultural ignorance and capitalist sycophancy is sickening, even for those of us who watch this as a guilty indulgence.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThe series didn&#39;t need to transition into a major motion picture, and the reboot was completely unnecessary. HBO simply should&#39;ve renewed it for two more seasons and call it a day.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaAs what Samantha has said here: “Man, babies it doesn’t matter… we’re still mates” <br>and to think that in ‘And Just Like That’ Samantha would leave Carrie and her friends for money???? That’s bs!!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaNot being rude, but if you liked this film, you&#39;re probably missing a chromosome.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI sincerely hope that the spin off series is able to wipe the slate clean.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshita1 like sorry god and for give me God
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaIs my is my mother goose club out.

pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI wish i could be a SATC chick. No real life problems
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaTV series was one of the best art work for me. And this movie was the worst movie that I watched throughout my life.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaBEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThank U so much for putting this movie on Netflix 😍😍😍😍❤️
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still waiting the third 🙏🏻
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI want a 3rd movie with carrie and big married life , miranda and steve love’s , charlotte and harry romance and Samantha getting up with smith and stay with him

pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know which one is the hotel they shoot in Egypt?
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so glad coffee guy made it in the trailer
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI wish that they made a 3rd one, but now I guess it’s too little and too late
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the world&#39;s best contraceptive.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaمـيــــن🥰 يـرحــــب🥰 بـي🥰 يــضـغط لايــــك🥰ويـراسـلـنـي خـــــاص واشـــترك بقـــناتــــي<br>  واتساب**00212.675.283.741*💋💋💋
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThis was better than 1st
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaIs that Miley Cyrus?
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get what everybody&#39;s problem is. I LOVED that movie and still giggle about scenes out of it that randomly come to my mind. They just added a little extra of luxury for the movie but it was still good!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaIf you haven’t seen this movie, do it - it’s healthy and funny and comes with multiple good messages. Loved it
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie just now...<br>I swear girl&#39;s, totally worth it.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI think of this sometimes when I need an example of a trailer that way oversold a movie, without using scenes that didn’t make the final cut.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaNothing is Arabian from their traveling it’s humongous and exaggerated
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so ridiculous,
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaMgtow
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaCarrie telling Samantha to think of her hot flash as a means of knowing she&#39;s still alive is a pretty optimistic way to look at hot flashes. &quot;You&#39;re on a camel in the middle of the Arabian desert. If you&#39;re not having a hot flash, you&#39;re dead.&quot;
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThe fashion seems to have got worse as it went on. It hit a peak at the end of s6 but this? I mean just because someone slaps a few thousand dollar tag on an outfit it doesn’t mean that;<br>A) We can see the label <br>&amp;<br>B) it doesn’t look like it came from a Walmart summer sale next to the flip flops and beach balls. <br>They should’ve made them wear the clothes inside out of the labels were so important.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaAmo la serie.mas las peliculas y mas a samantha
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaRelived this on Netflix, even though I own the DVD. I had forgotten how amazing the dresses and hair styles on the leading ladies were in this movie! 🍿 The SATC finale - sad, but so many memories! Miss these girls!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI love samantha
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI actually really liked this movie! It&#39;s so funny and entertaining.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaVacuous drivel about awful people
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they show tthe whole story in the trailer?
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s the worst movie of all time~<br>it&#39;s the worst movie of all time~<br>it&#39;s the worst movie of all tiiiiiiiiiiime~
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD! There dressing throughout the movie was an abomination
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshita&quot;I don&#39;t know which is worse&quot;<br>&quot;Samantha, the baby will tire&quot;
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaIm straight guy.. and luv watching every once while still ...   There&#39;s good chick flicks that exist in this world that men like,. Too me chick flicks is the best way to learn about women and how they act or feel. And now many lady&#39;s luv me cuz I listen and relate positive advice, gentleman 4 life
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI enjoyed this movie so much. Seen it multiple times. Love those girls. 💜💙❤️💜💙❤️
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitawe need 3rd movie
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI am happy there won’t be a 3rd one because the second one was just lame in comparison to the initial série and the first was kind of good but for me sex in the city ended at the end of season 6...
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie ever.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaKim should make a third movie. I don&#39;t like ppl I work with too, but but let&#39;s be honest, who likes? Fans deserve third movie
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThe story takes places in Abu Dhabi but it was actually filmed in Morocco !!!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThe worst film ever made.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaDoes Penelope a guest here??
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI liked the first movie and I&#39;m pretty sure I will like this one too! Lots of bad reviews but I want to see for myself...love the franchise!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaSex IN the city *
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaUTTER CRAP!
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was bad. Extremely bad. It was a sad effort of the cast to stay relevant. Since when was sex and the city about luxury? I thought it was about all kinds of relationships and an elegant touch of style. The first one was mediocre too. I can&#39;t get over the scene where Carrie attacks Big with her bridal bouquet in the middle of the street!! So not classy! Something Carrie would NEVER do. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over with the movies.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaKim should do the movie for the fans even though she doesn’t like Sarah.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaif that movie came out today the pc crowd would annihilate it for being offensive to muslims.
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaSex in the city or Sex and the city??? WTH
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitaI want to vomit...
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitanicee
pY7sAJm8FukdelimeterByIshitayeah put it in...put it in!!!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaI fuckin love this triler
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaAwesome car movie.  Better than those gay Fast and the furious Films.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaI actually like this movie. I thought it was fun, this was actually the first movie I saw Jason Statham in and thought he was awesome. The only problem I had with it was that I wanted someone to actually win the race.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bxcJZrus0&amp;t=1m56s">1:56</a> Death Race (2008) trailer spoils itself!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWelcome to death race 😃👦👏
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaJason Stateham did a perfect role in this
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaSomeone knows the music of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bxcJZrus0&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> ?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaLooks good, but you&#39;d think they could sum up the premise in less than two and a half minutes.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaVery hit movie
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaFull auto the movie!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaso, pretty much a Mad Max ripoff
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaddd
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThis is twisted metal meets mad max meets Mario cart.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t believe in critics and other people bad response towards this Movie.<br>I truly loved this movie and cannot ever forget this.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitagood

C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaFast and furious in a prison. Great movie at the same time.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaHow come i never heard of this 5 years ago??!!!!!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaIf Death Race 2000 was Carmageddon then 2008 Death Race was Twisted Metal
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaJason Statham and Tyrese Gibson in one bad ass action film. What&#39;s better than that?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWhat is the music name on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bxcJZrus0&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> pls ?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitawelcome to the jungle guns and roses 1980s
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the music used at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bxcJZrus0&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a> minute mark
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitabasically Mad Max without desert
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaa good movie, is my favorite movie, mustang shelby
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitathe best fucking movie
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaso which version is better, the extended or unrated?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitahow it is called the soundtrack
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaAstig!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitathat realy is episode 3
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaReally inspired
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThank you for TL;DR version!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita&quot;Oh yeah, <i>Death Race</i>, that movie that stars Ian McShane.&quot;<br>- No one
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThey should remake this for PG-13 and 3D. Just tone down the violence and gore just like how The Expendables 3 did. Anderson might cast Milla Jovovich as Frankenstein&#39;s navigator but it sounds like a fantastic idea.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThis could be a prequel to Fast and Furious XDDD
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaSo many spoilers in a trailer
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaFurious 7? Lol
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitatwisted metal the movie
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaPRODIGY
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaone of my favorite movies :) awesome!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaimagine vin diesel in death race 4?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bxcJZrus0&amp;t=1m59s">1:59</a> gta san andreas sounds :)))
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitalove death race ! when death race 4 become ?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaSo Hunger Games is kind of like this
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWell, this trailer is a spoiler. Don&#39;t watch till the end 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t like the way they showed the blood :s 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaHow does this compare to the original?<br><br>Was a big fan of the original but I&#39;m unsure if I should watch this and the sequels :x
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t really seem as interesting as the 75&#39;s movie. And it&#39;s not very usual coming from me, since movies older than 90&#39;s are not very watchable to me. But in the original version of this movie, it was a competition of who took the most innocent lives, which is sick yet thrilling. And this just seems all about cars and explosions... Can&#39;t judge since I haven&#39;t watched the movie yet, but it&#39;s kinda hard to get into the mood of watching this when I&#39;m under the impression that it&#39;s just like I&#39;m predicting. Please, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. D:
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThis is better than 2 &amp; 3 cuz its statham!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaprodigy - hot ride
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitasuch a good movie unlike the other 2 sequels
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the song/soundtrack bit that plays at 1:20
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitadafuk? what kind of jail is this!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like freakin twisted metal , Oh man awsomeeeeeeeeee!!!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called, uh, security? They&#39;re on a prison island, and the guards have a fucking Truck / tank hybrid?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaits funny how they got guns on cars but cant break out of the prison
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWELCOME TO THE JUNGLE !!!!!!!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitamustang

C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaMASHED
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaBEST RACE MOVIE ever! Race to death huh
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaHolly shit it appears Toretto is in serious issues with this guy
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitai am watching now yau
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaDeath Race 2 and 3 were prequels to Death Race.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaholy shit this is a twisted metal movie :O
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaLove it vin diesel
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThat should be part 3 cause 14k survived in part 2 and 3 now 14k died in the first one
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita8 more with him..
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe they pretty much gave away the ending.  Wow.  Trailers nowadays just give it away,
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWaoohhaohh!! Watched the trailer, that looks awesome! Thanks man!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaGas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is best car combat game. Forget about twisted metal.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThis movie would make one heck of a game.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitawessoomeeeeee
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaMovie is so predictable! From just this trailer i know story. So, too many informations.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitawhat?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaSaid no one ever.
 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitameh you know people ant there imagination ^-^
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitacant beliv theres 2 seqels already, this looks like shit
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitait would be so good if Vin Diesel was in this movie 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita2:00 that song reminds me of GTA S.A. XD
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitafoursomeeeeeeeeeeeeee
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitawonder ful
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s litterally no difference between this and the second one. the second one just had better actors, what the actual fuck?
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitagreatest trailer.. ever
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaxD.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaNow they&#39;re gonna do a threesome in hell. :P
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaSomeone&#39;s gonna join him... :P.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaprodigy - hot ride ... HELL YEAH !!!!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaStatham&#39;s presence increases the awesomeness by 10!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaHang on to yer Helmet.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshita2013* ;))))
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaShe didn&#39;t create Death Race
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaHate it when trailers sow you the whole film, don&#39;t need to watch it now
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaGood movie
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitareally bad trailer indeed!
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaWhy watch the movie? I just saw the whole story arc on the trailer.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaIt reminds me gladiators. Wild culture of wild west is destroying the world.
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaVery cool and intense movie. Jason Statham was brilliant here. He&#39;s the greatest action star of modern days
Death Race is one of my favorite Sci-Fi/Action films from the 2000&#39;s (along with Pandorum, Gamer, Serenity, Push, Children of Men, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The Chronicles of Riddick, Minority Report, Equilibrium, Ultraviolet, X-Men, The 6th Day, The Tournament and Eagle Eye) 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitai wanna see this film 
C8bxcJZrus0delimeterByIshitaI love the title.
Not a Jason Statham movie, an Ian McShane movie XD
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshita⛺️🫣
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThe comment section made me watch this movie lol, bless
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaI wish today&#39;s trailers would leave you guessing like this. Gave as little plot as possible.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis is a must watch. The ending is a true gem.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaHmmm. Im gonna watch it, Havent watched it because I greatly dislike Bruce Willis and the girl that looks like a bed bug, Lucy Liu.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaFeel lucky to watch this as number slevin movie this week.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThey do stories to humiliate and robe me in public to feed their small terrorists band from perm
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaMan, this trailer really gives too much away and makes the film seem like an action packed romantic crime comedy when the movie. It&#39;s a great film, but the trailer really tarnishes the experience if you see it before watching the movie.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaMagnífica película
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is WAY more clever than it looks..
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaSuch a classic highly recommended
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie years ago and I could never remember what it was called. What an awesome movie this is, and one of my fav&#39;s👍
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaLucy Liu is Annoying As F8ck in this Movie.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaFelt like it was 2006 again for 2 minutes
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaCool trailer, doesn&#39;t spoil too much
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaMovie was bomb af.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaAnyone watching this and wondering if they should watch it, you should!<br>Saw this many moons ago and its one of my favorites. I just love everything about it, the story, the actors, the twist.<br>Definitely recommended.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThe Rabbi was more wise and calculative one. <br>1.He guessed that guy is not Nick Fisher<br>2. He knew the boss was getting big that&#39;s why took more profit with him<br>3. Stays in less security then the boss but ready for any outcome<br>4. Wanted to buy out Slevin.

mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshita❤️🍀♾does anyone die in the end? Asking for a “friend” - my roommate is toxic and I don’t have time to enjoy watching it
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaVeterans combined.👏👏👏
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaDid they consider Colin Farrell for the lead role? notwithstanding Josh’s great work….
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely top 5 movies of mine . Unexpected gem
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshita이거 레알 꿀잼 영화임 마지막 반전 대박
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaTrailer makes this look like a whole ’nother movie, just another mob movie and not an original one at that. May be why it’s so underrated, as it’s so much more—a first-rate original thriller…
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaStupidest movie I&#39;ve ever seen.  No plot, and poor acting.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea why I didn’t watch this film until 2021. I love Bruce Willis movies and Morgan Freeman movies too. What a great story.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaI tend to search for heist things about once a month but never heard of this
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie 100% recomended. Look like a comedy at first . Finally it gets very siruos thriller criminal film
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaBased on a true story.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so well done, it&#39;s fast paced, great characters with clever chemistry and twists, when the plot comes together it&#39;s so satisfying. It ranks around some of my favourite plot twist movies like Fight Club, Usual Suspects, The Departed ect..
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis man got too many punches in his stomach🤛
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie so much!
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they call him the Rabbi?<br>Because he IS the Rabbi 🤣
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaWhen Bruce made decent movies!
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitamovie&#39;s awesome!!! trailer toke that and made a crazy comedy  action bullshit with it.... what a waste
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaMan this movie was good. One of my all time favourites. And i watch a lot of movies.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaGreatest revenge movie I have ever watched. 20/10
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitathis movie is still a masterpiece
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaback in the days when every action movie trailer had the same narrator
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaLmao I&#39;m not nick he did tell them but its not until story unfolds your like wowwww
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaSlevin ya seven guessing 🙄🙄🙄🙄
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie includes every possible reason to be a hit, however it’s super flop <br>Shame is very best one
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaWords really can&#39;t describe how good this movie is if you don&#39;t like this movie your intelligence is low nothing but twists and plots kept you on the edge of your seat and the ending is probably one of the most explosive endings in any movie, not only was good kat an Great assassin  he was even brilliant at a plot twist this movie is about him he is the plot he just took the little boy along with him, what a movie man I&#39;m telling you if you never see this movie before you really really really really need to see this movie so you can  paint the picture that I was painting and that&#39;s a very a explosive ending that will have you mind boggling.. definitely a 10 out of 10 for me easy... What a great plot with great characters equals a great movie.. they did they thing in this this movie its so underrated....
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaWhen Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu kiss it&#39;s a bit like seeing a mirror kiss itself. They are equally beautiful and have precisely the same sort of beauty.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of my favorite films of all time.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks stupid.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaIn the trailer they removed Bruce Willis in the explosion scene..... well done mate..
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie needs more attention
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated movie.  I know so many people who are like &quot;  who was in it?&quot;  &quot; Not familiar with it.&quot; Etc . Surprisingly.
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t this available on YouTube to rent/buy?
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThe plot in this movie was epics
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaCame here because someone in reddit recommended this movie.. Looks good
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThe dialogue in this movie made me wanna vomit
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t you just <b>*LOVE*</b> when trailer spoils the whole movie?
mGQmSCQrKKQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie that&#39;s amazing.

9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaPlease make a sequel with Jake and his hair minus the Janet chica
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThis is how you make a trailer, was something completley different. Got me trippin.
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaSurly Oscar worthy🏆
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie. 2 thumbs up
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was always somewhat sad to me, but after I became a cop and especially after going some of the stuff I’ve gone through on the streets and watching it again, this movie hit me on another emotional level that I can’t explain. Especially the funeral scene at the end holy crap
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaIts back on Netflix!
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is basically the opposite of Reno 911

9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitathis is the best buddy cop movie EVER. go check this out its hilarious yet so heartbreaking
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshita&quot;you&#39;re a cop because you don&#39;t know how not to be one&quot;
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaWow
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, if you like great movies with freat acting watch this!
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitafor me, this is the greatest cop movie ever made.
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if the cops have to be weary of the cartels or is this just a movie..
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so underated
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaBit late but just watched. Best cop movie ive seen for years. Great action and well directed.
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThis is crazy!
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaThe story is good and so are the actors, but I don’t like the way it’s filmed. It looks cheap or a B-film, even though it’s not
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaPublished On Aug 1,2016

9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaOMG... I&#39;m tearing up seeing the ending.. I love this movie! 💕
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaMakes sense the guy who co-wrote Training Day directed this. Awesome direction
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie. But seriously, the drug cartel/gang bangers shooting the AK&#39;s and not immediately killing the cops was not really believable... Hollywood I guess. Other than that, awesome movie.
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitawow cannot believe how shitty this trailer is.

9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaHands down best cop movie I&#39;ve ever seen
9mQYxib26FMdelimeterByIshitaToo much gruesome violence and too many close-ups of moles on the leads, especially J.G. Why do celebrities keep those things when they have so many surgery options?

wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThey filmed this in NYC, mostly in Brooklyn AND I MET ZAC! =) I remember that day exactly because i froze my ass waiting for him to come out of his trailer. 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMaybe a bit of a stretch... and by bit I mean ginormous

both this and neighbours looks super funny!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaZac is so hot and the movie is really fun. I&#39;m gonna watch this&lt;3
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThis actually look good...
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitagarbage
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaFor some reason this movie reminds me of New Girl
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaI normally hate movies that arenjust about sex, but this one has something that intrigues me, friendship between guys, so im actually looking forward to seeing it.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshita1:07 describes 99% of the actions we guys make ;)
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMichael B. Jordan came far from being a guy who died first in a movie to a guy who&#39;s gonna play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitauh. no.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitathe black guy is like Winston from new girl
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaLmao sad giraffe.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaToo many naked boys chests
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaI wanna watch it! When does it come out?
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like new girl, but a movie version.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMiles Teller sounds exactly like Jonah Hill. Anyone?
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThis looks tragic
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitano matter how hard he pushes the Michael &#39;B&#39; Jordan label, his name will always be Michael Jordan
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaYou could say it&#39;s a.. &#39;dick flick&#39; 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMiles Teller!! I love that guy!!!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaPass.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaSo basically it&#39;s New Girl without Zooey Deschanel....got it
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMILES TELLER &lt;3 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshita.....cliché
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaJustice League?? Yeah, I can see that.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshita&quot;Run and tell that&quot; they would lol.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaLOL TIS the inevitable
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitahow long do any of you give Michael B. Jordan before they put him in a dress? lol
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitathat picture matches this comment so much 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshita&quot;It looks like a sad giraffe.&quot; Wow I don&#39;t know either to laugh or just walk away shaking my head. But Ha 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaWHAT TEAM...op..sorry, nevermind. 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMichael B Jordan for cyborg.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitablack doug 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitathe hangover no black guy
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThis is a little too sensitive for my taste. Lot of odd emotional man baggage I never knew existed. I&#39;m not interested in my friend&#39;s inner turmoils, specially in matters of the heart, and maybe that makes me some kind of dick, but maybe I&#39;m just one of those that dont talk about &quot;feelings&quot; and prefer dealing with whatever issue on my own. Much respect to the whole bro&#39;s before ho&#39;s code but even that gets stupid. For me its like the saying, &quot;If I were anymore sensitive, I&#39;d be wearing a skirt&quot;.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaIf no else is going to say it I will JESSICA LUCAS
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaLOOOLLLL yupp
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaGay..O_O!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaits always three guys, and one of them has to be black
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitamiles teller is funny as fuck 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitalol

wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to not see this.
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThat awkward moment when your name is Michael Jordan
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitawhat are the songs in this?
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThis actaully looks good :) Zac efron isn&#39;t that bad. 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaHernan benites, so you don&#39;t have friends like this?  That&#39;s some sad shit
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaThis shit gone be funny as fuck. I was dying off the trailer alone. I know this shit gone have me rolling!!!!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMangina: The Movie

wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitanope still a chick flick
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaits called a buddy comedy, it has existed before.

wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitadid i just watch the whole film?
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaMiles Teller?? i definetly gonna watch this! :D
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaZac effron looks like he&#39;s gonna act like Chris traeger from parks and recreations
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaErrr... never really been that open about showing my junk to friends @_@
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaSo...this is basically a chick flick for dudes. 
Fair enough. 
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaOMG zac efron is just soo hot can&#39;t wait to watch this movie !!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaplot looks like garbage, but they ment well

wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaGaaaaay!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitaSHIT ZAC LOOKS HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitathis is just like new girl
wRcVgJjnFLodelimeterByIshitathis is the series new girl minus jess in a movie
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI have nothing against the concept, I get it he got a new pair of shoes and things started looking up for him, and then someone comes and takes them from him. All power to him for standing up for himself, my issue is of all the shoes, some air Jordan ones. Not a pair 12s, or 11s or 5s or 6s, any of the shoes kids get robbed for today. No he got Jugged for the cheapest pair of Jordan&#39;s, wtf.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshita&quot;Michael Jordan don&#39;t care about black people&quot;
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks gd
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitahe can can low key play huey Freeman from the boondocks
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like an interesting commentary on commercialism and gang violence. Great young actor also
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks better than GHOSTBUSTERS
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just glad Jaden Smith didn&#39;t star in this one.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitafor all of you who don&#39;t understand the message behind this, think about the song Pumped Up Kicks. the song is titled about shoes, but we all know the song isn&#39;t just about shoes. it has a much deeper message behind it
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Riley?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitagone to go see this
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitamusic?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThumbnail looking like a girl singing
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaso a fight started because of shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaseems about thevrigbt age for me
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSo...... the dude wants his shoes back....... nice movie
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t mackelmore make a song about this? lol
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI like the new Tarzan trailer, but where was Tarzan??? 😮
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaa thug steals your shoes<br><br>best solution:become a thug

rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%231stworldblackpeopleproblems">#1stworldblackpeopleproblems</a>
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaMovie look dope asf and showcase a hood drama for the world to see which I&#39;m down to see
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitacould be a good movie, if it wasn&#39;t about damn shoes.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIt about the shoes but not really. The kid stated that he is basically a loser who lives in the ghetto as a poor kid. He gets brand new kicks that elevates his life and gives him a sense of self worth and respect (seen by the girl talking to him), only for it to be stolen from him. So basically now he wants revenge and his kicks back but in reality he fighting for his &quot;respect&quot; in which he feel was lost when they were stolen. Its child logic but reality as this is life for some kids growing up in the streets.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSEND THIS TO QIASOMAR
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSo he either ends up killing the guy and regretting it, or has a change of mind right at the end after going through all the shit to get to him to not shoot him.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaits trying to be like Dope. Lets see if it can pull it off.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was filmed in the Bay Area seems like it will have a good story line excited to see this
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitawho knew how far someone would go for being jacked of his jordans....dann
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI swear to god I thought it was female, even through half the video.  Am like why a dude narrating this than I realized.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThe object lesson here, is that when you get a nice pair of shoes, you should defile them in some way, so when someone goes to steal them, you can be like &quot;Do you really want that touching your feet all day long, every day, just working its way through your socks into your skin? I mean you could try to wash them, or something, but can you really ever get something clean again after that??
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshita&quot;All of that for a pair of shoes? What a dumb concept!&quot; <b>story goes right over your head</b> and I feel bad for you.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaweak in Chicago they would have shot the kid first scene .  Wouldn&#39;t take a whole movie to shoot someone
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaso this movie is all about retrieving a pair of shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaWhy do i get the urge to cut his hair
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThey ain&#39;t yeezys tho
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThe kid shoudnt have taken those Kicks then
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaTook me 1/3 of the trailer to realize he&#39;s not a girl.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitajust for a pair of shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s good to see you where people&#39;s values are. It&#39;s all about shoes and your image
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI thought he was a girl!
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like to me he is mad cuz they stole his shoes
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitanot bad
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaYou are all some ignorant people fam....obviously it&#39;s not about fighting over sneakers its about a kid who is tired of getting bullied and disrespected by his peers. The sneakers are just a plot device.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitathis looks surprisingly good for a dumbass concept
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good i would like to see this film :)
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaAll that for a pair of (I&#39;m assuming, knock offs?) shoes? I get what the movie is trying to say. But.. Shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t get it
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaFirst it was John Wicks dog and now it this guys shoes what next somebody gets bumped into.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIf you think this movie is about shoes you&#39;re way too white, uneducated, and/or way too privileged
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaman this just reminds me of Holes
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks intense! Definitely will give it a watch :D
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaTitle should be:&quot;Dindonuffin!&quot;
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaidk why they used &quot;kicks&quot; as main topic in a growing up in the hood story. looks good tho
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaso from what this movie is saying it that if you have a nice pair of nike&#39;s you can get anything.......
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIf y&#39;all didn&#39;t know the dude rapping in the closet is biggie&#39;s son
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaStop black on black violence.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaracist movie
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaTitle shld be &quot;STUPID&quot;
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaNow black people fight for shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSo this is basically John Wick the hood version?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSo this is basically John Wick the hood version?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaso this movie is about shoes
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThe racial pain hurricane will strike
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThey took my shoes so I became a thug. Flawless logic.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIs this an origin story of Zero from &quot;Holes&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the kid who played him. Also, in Holes, the kid steals a pair of shoes and gets chased for them. This is the exact same thing.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s really cute
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a solid film. At the very least the cinematography looks great...hoping the rest is of the same quality.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitafor realz?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitapretty much, you get clipped by a couple of J&quot;s en el barrio
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaare shoes meant to be drugs?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitajust called this dope 2: the other side
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaAll that for a pair of shoes ??? Smh
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaReally hyped to see this! I feel like this will be that same surprise to me that Dope was last summer.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitawhen Hollywood has no more ideas
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaOh look, a black person movie.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaZero? That you?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaPlot Twist : This movie is actually just a long commercial for shoes
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be intresting
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitathe shots are very well constructed and this looks like one of those films that are more than meets the eye. I&#39;m down to see it.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaso its a film about a pair of shoes?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaA movie about some kids kicks.... <br><br><br><br>BUT LOOKS DOPE AF
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaare they serious or are they Jahking with this movie?
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaWell damn not gonna lie that&#39;s how it is the the hood well in Compton anyways
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaIt stars a minority and depicts the struggles of African-Americans growing up in ghettos. Clearly you&#39;re racist if you don&#39;t want to see it.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s like John Wick but instead of a dog it&#39;s his Kicks.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitaI wear boots and work so.... this movie isn&#39;t for me.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitatook me half the trailer to understand that that&#39;s not a girl.

rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshitarotten tomatoes will probably call this best movie ever made.
rci4qxqcooAdelimeterByIshita2nd
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the house they used in the movie ?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSoundtrack and acting was good, however story was boriiiiiiiiiinnnng. The house fell in 15 months... gotta be kidding me!
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitathis is the most worst time wasted fuck film ever made for making people more fucked up ,dame upon those ass film makers who are responciable for crab like these
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitalittle sister avator in 3d was used in game last of us ,i m shure of it.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the movie. It was kinda boring and the end was very disappointing to me. But Evan Rachel Wood&#39;s performance was Oscar worthy.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaEsta pelicula es buena, te mantiene en el sofa, aunque sea lenta y larga. El drama de esta pelicula te hace vivir cada momento como si fuera real... por lo menos para mi fue bien realista. Del 1 al 10 yo le doy un 8.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaWell hello Ellen Page
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaIs it a good movie?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the song I can&#39;t find it anywhere!!!
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer I saw was a bit misleading, slightly, but definitely give this amazing film a shot.<br>Simply beautiful performances, especially from Wood.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked, only good part is you get to see ellen page&#39;s tits.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaBiriniz bana müziğini bulup atabilir mi? Love me diye olanı
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSaw it. Tedious overwrought melodrama. Really. Ugg.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSow what&#39;s the plot aside from surviving the end of the world?  I didn&#39;t see anything chasing them?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaReally hope she decides to keep her legs closed in this movie, the last thing I ever want to watch is another Juno. In fact, that movie forever ruined my outlook of any movie that Ellen Page will ever play in....but in all reality I secretly liked Juno, just not the catchy music that was involved. Have I confused anyone yet?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitacan you guys tell me the names of the  songs on the movie ؟
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaIf the muslims are behind the power outage and attacking the grid again, I&#39;ll be pissed.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m gonna watch it just bc evan rachel wood is in it &lt;3
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TRSvK-Omwc&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> Is that Ellie ?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI SE THIS LAST DAT IT IS FUCING BORING MOVE
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSuch a no-commonsense movie, although there are direct references to the realistic &quot;into the Wild&quot;, their optimism considering the odds and conditions is puzzling.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitawhat the F they are doing there in the first place ?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI read this book all the way back in high school! I loved it so much and still have a copy. :)
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaahhh i want be strong in english😔
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI hope there girl on girl action in this movie
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is SO SLOW it actually contains a scene, lasting several minutes, were two young women argue about a few pieces of chocolate .
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaInto the woods, into the forest, what&#39;s next... into the jungle.......
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaFULL MOVIE : run out of electricity &gt; dad died &gt; got raped &gt; have a baby &gt; burned the house.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitalove this movie.... nice story line... hat off to the writer...
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSingle parent takes two daughters to a holiday home in the woods, the power shuts down, no real reason why, it&#39;s countryside? Area wide? Family goes into town, little food in shops, no gas, family goes back to home, father chops his leg of with chainsaw..girls cry a bit and leave him in the forest. Then , it drrrraaaaaagggggs on and on and on like something that needs to be shot. Then one of the girls is raped, then the house starts to fall to pieces after only 15 months since power outage, why? Then girl is pregnant so has baby inside a hollowed out tree then they burn the house down and bugger off......No direction, overly indulgent, all over the place film. Easily the worst film I have seen in a long time....
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaWatching now and it&#39;s rather anticlimactic 😩
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSuch a dumb movie...
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaIt was to painfully slow and hugely mind numbingly boring...what&#39;s the point of social,collapse and disorder without full on mayhem....
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaCure the cure  g
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI hope the movie is as good as the book.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI hope the Movie is better than the Trailer......
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita2 actresses I can&#39;t stand. but okay...
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThey are SISTERS? oh the disappointment.. :D
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaif Ellen Page is in it I&#39;ll watch it
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaHope is...a 4G LTE signal
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m rather confused
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitareminds me of slender
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused, is this out? Listed on imdb as released on 2015 but then says 29 July 2016 underneath.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitabeautiful cinematography but movie looks very boring
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t wanna give the ending away,  but HUH?     Will there be a part 2?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitagg
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaSo.... It&#39;s a movie about post apocalyptic death and murder and rape and sisterhood...... You&#39;ve been spoiled by the positive remarks about Swiss army man A24......
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the song?

_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaellen page runs like a spastic lol.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitawhat happens when the WiFi turns off
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitawell lets be honest, this is how the worlds going down anyway
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the trailer seriously?<br>I&#39;m sleeping.....-.-
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaLast of us
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaI would watch this just for the cinematography. That director looks awesome.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaFirst trailer in a while where I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve just watched the entire film
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita<b>&quot;A scene of violence involving rape&quot;</b><br><br>Not only does this tool for terror spoil the plot, but we all know who gets raped and it&#39;s not the men. Apparently that&#39;s the first thing men wanna do in the midst of Anarchy and shows how laws, government, education don&#39;t do shit in keeping humanity civil or meritorious, since raping women is always in the back of men&#39;s minds. Laws don&#39;t stop them anyway. Just a thought.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitanow that&#39;s how you do a trailer!
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThe nature sounds and the mild haunting theme tone makes this a great trailer.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaLooks intense. I can&#39;t wait to see it!
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita&gt;Based on the best selling novel<br>No longer interested
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaLast of Us DLC
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaJust gals being pals.
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve been waiting for this for ages! so excited its now got distribution :)
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitalooks great!
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks intense and enigmatic. I look forward to watching it 🤔😀
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaThis is Pure Shit .
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshitaIs this a thriller or just a drama?
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita360p
_TRSvK-OmwcdelimeterByIshita8 seconds?! Some kind of record...<br>:DDDDDDDD
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@Bluelonely0 Yeah, I won&#39;t lie that the liberties taken with the facts really bother me.  Especially considering that the author of the original book claims this to be &quot;actual history&quot;.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@kuzcoxtopia Actually, they say that Henry chose a sword rather than an axe to kill Anne as a sign of his continual love for her; a sword providing a much swifter and more accurate death than an axe.  And you&#39;re confusing Mary Boleyn, mistress of the King with Mary I of England, daughter of the King and Queen Katherine. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@georgiaaustin While I love the performance of all the actors in this film, I feel that they cut out far too much of the story.  I&#39;ve read the book, which is richly detailed and intensely powerful in it&#39;s story telling.  I don&#39;t feel this movie truly did justice to that story.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@SulthanaB226 It&#39;s all a matter of motivation.  You&#39;re talking about a time when the King was absolute ruler, answerable only to God.  Moreover, you&#39;re at a time when women were nothing more than &quot;brood mares&quot;, good only for providing a male heir to carry the family name and a daughter to marry off in political alliance.  Taken into account, the King&#39;s behavior, while disgusting to our tastes, was expected in that time.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@kuzcoxtopia 
Yeah you&#39;re right, I&#39;ve mistaken. They&#39;re all called Mary ^^&#39; Thx, you helped me for my civilization test in two weeks :)
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita1- If Henry VIII had look like Eric, he would&#39;ve been so much loved :)
2- If Anne had look like Natalie, Henry VIII never would&#39;ve killed her :(
3- If Mary had look like Scarlett, she never would&#39;ve been called &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; :)
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaWow, Anne is such a bitch, stealing the King away from her sister... tsk tsk
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaOh my god they have the story completely wrong. Blah. I still wanna see it though.

NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@Bluelonely0 the book that this movie is based on is historical FICTION!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@kelly19091 basically it was planned for anne boleyn to seduce the king of england so that they could gain social power. however he fell for her sister mary. she gave him a son, even tho he was still married. anne seduced him and forced him to break with the catholic church and divorce his wife to marry her and make her queen. she gave him one daughter, elizabeth. she again became pregnant, but lost the child. she tried to become pregnat by sleeping with her brother. she was caught and beheaded 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@kelly19091 The Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Boleyn want Anne to get the mistress of Henry. But then Anne makes a mistake and Henry gets atracted on Mary, Anne&#39;s sister. Henry and Mary have a child together but then Anne &quot;steales&quot; the Kinga way from her sisiter to get queen.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good thing I love Eric Bana so much...I could puke on him in this movie!!!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@iamfire1 Yes i very much loved the Tudors. its a tv series about Henry the 8th and his 6 wives and very well told . 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@secondchild0011 The Young is my absolute FAV! i very much enjoy the victorian era and the Tudor dynasty. by the way have you watch the Tudors?
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@secondchild0011 from you comment i&#39;m gunna guess your american. and i&#39;m like you i don&#39;t care for my own history (australian) and i&#39;am very much in love with english history. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@georgiaaustin anyone who is with you should be, as mike able said, &#39;taken to the ground and made sure they&#39;re kept down&#39;.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@HJManson then a foe i shall be, for this film is fantastic! who&#39;s with me? 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaanyone who watches this film is instantly a foe of mine, shame on you all. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaThis is, like THE TUDORS, very beautiful and entertaining. Totally inaccurate - but who cares? Its great fun.  Don&#39;t see it if you are precious about history though.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie 2 years ago, and I didn&#39;t even recognize Natalie Portman!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh! I totally recognize the trailer song!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie! 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@LadyTimTam yea I didn&#39;t get that far the only one I paid attention to was his relationship with Anne and with this movie I wish he would of stayed with Mary
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@SulthanaB226 ok evidently niether one of u have actual looked into the whole Henry the eight the dude had five wives all because he wanted a male heir and he went to them
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaHenry VIII is one lucky son of a bitch. Hemm......... Natalie Portman or Scarlet Johanson????
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaHaha, Henry VIII certainly did not look like that!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry, have not seen this movie before, but I&#39;ve seen The Tudors. From this trailer, i say The Tudors is better!!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI prefer the cast of The Tudors
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@ranka35 i thought this movie was pretty good (:
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie ever... Outstanding actors and impeccable script...
this should be an Oscar﻿ nominated movie not other silly movies :P
bravo for the team that made this movie ..
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the movie and it&#39;s great !
Natalie Portman is amazing here ! ! ! :D
She makes us, Israeli people- proud xDDD
JK :P

NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song after she says: &quot;make me your queen&quot;?
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@ollylovere me!

NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitai have seen the film and its reaaallyyy gooodd!! natalie portman is brilliant!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitawell... now that I know the whole freaking story, not much point in watching it.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@littomamaJ Oops, I meant I&#39;ve READ the book.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve the book and watched the movie. They did the best they can to make the movie as great as the book. There are a few differences, of course. And the book explains things better than the movie. The book is absolutely great! 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitait looks soo good! and i really want to read the book too!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitasounds a bit like the narnia trailer music
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI watched this last night on bbc. It was so good :D
Some of the hairstyles of Scarlett and Natalie were awesome too :)
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitai started reading the book yesterday. SOOO GOOD .
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@liquidstone14 Haha so true
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@xUnf0rg1vabl3x Nah, since i&#39;ve seen this movie hundreds of times i don&#39;t bother reading the book. It would take the fun out of reading it when i&#39;ve watched it already. i usually read the books 1st then c its movie if its been made into 1 =)
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitanice original trailer music 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@GeishaDevi  Have you read the book?? I am currently in the process of reading it! only 334 pages to go! :D
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Why r u here 4 her&quot;? &quot;because she&#39;s my sister, another 1 half of me.&quot; I mean what did he expect her 2 say? &quot;Oi, i randomly just decided 2 stop by 4 a cup of tea regardless of the fact that popping by could risk my own life!&quot; Of course she&#39;s there 4 her freaking sister, ERM - DUH: that&#39;s her own sibling who wouldn&#39;t try 2 save their sister from death? Un less u hate your sibling. but even with rivalry mary had the guts 2 come back for her sister&#39;s life. Mary ftw.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@austriangirl411
thanks  
im glad you liked my casting
i thougth everyone is going to say that  im crazy 
these actors are too old for this roles (czj, nicole and crowe or hough jackman)
 but maybe they choosed the  cast they did because Ann Boleyn  was killed at  a very young  age 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitai want another movie of the boleyn sisters
with  older actors 
this is would be my perfect cast 
catherine zeta jones as Ann Boleyn 
Nicole Kidman as Mary Boleyn
Hough Jackman or Russell Crowe as king Henry 
the rest of the cast doesnt matter to me

 i loved this movie its just it would be nice to see another version   
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaThe King was so stupid! He finally gets a Son and then turns to the other Sister!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitai love natalie portman in this movie :) 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitacan some one tell me the soundtrack starting from 0:0 - 0:15 ??? plz reply
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@11Juliet i agree with you about Philippa Gregory&#39;s strange interpretation of anne boleyn&#39;s character. i also read the book long before the film was released, and i enjoyed it as literature and i liked how it was told from mary&#39;s perspective but hated how anne was portrayed as some sort of power hungry monster. the way she was portrayed in this film was far more toned down than the actual book and as far as i remembered not exactly historically accurate... 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@blandccastagno I know! I always wonder when something like this comes out WHY they won&#39;t just, for once, make a movie about what actually happened, because (along with the obvious ethical reasons) the real history actually IS more interesting than any of the ridiculous twists they&#39;ve come up with! Not to mention much more heartbreaking. :( I really hope it actually happens someday!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaAnd it isn&#39;t just me: even the historians she used as &quot;references&quot; for the incredible slant she created have disowned all responsibility and approval of the book. It just isn&#39;t okay. If someone had done this to more contemporary historical people, all the while pretending that it is not complete fiction, people would be completely outraged. But again, not enough people know about real Tudor England to recognize this story for what it is -- that&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to put the word out about.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaAlso, please don&#39;t take anything I&#39;m saying as negatively directed toward you -- that&#39;s not my intention. I&#39;ve just been VERY bothered by this ever since I read the book, long before the movie came out, and it just isn&#39;t possible for me to sit back and let people believe that it&#39;s anywhere near &quot;based on a true story&quot;. Philippa Gregory had an agenda when she wrote the book, and I find it beyond appalling. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@jamspice11 Well, I actually think I CAN change what people believe, if only because of the dozen+ emails I&#39;ve received from my first post on this page alone asking me for more information/resources about the real story. And I think I have just as much right to an opinion as you or anyone else... you like the movie, fine. I don&#39;t. And I think I have a valid reason. I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;re offended by my caring about people&#39;s reputations being trashed, but I can&#39;t help that I think it&#39;s disgusting.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@jamspice11 The problem I have with this movie is that the majority of people viewing it assume it is &quot;based on a true story&quot;, and thus believe that &quot;oh, probably only minor things were changed, basically this is what happened&quot; -- when that is SO pervasively far from the truth! The picture of Anne Boleyn painted in this movie is purposefully monstrous and disgusting -- which is a downright slap in the face and posthumous defamation of character about a real human being.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@jamspice11 True, but there is a huge difference between not being able to know specific personal details about a historical person/time/event, and not being able to know basic FACTS about said things -- and in this case, the facts about Henry Tudor and his court, including Anne Boleyn, are clearly documented and on display for anyone to see if they would take five minutes to look it up. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaanybody know this song? :O
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@11Juliet is there a movie that is the true story?
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI would beseech anyone intrigued by this material to educate themselves on the real story -- &quot;The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn&quot; by Eric Ives is a fantastic biography, as is really anything by Alison Weir. As far as movies/TV goes, Natalie Dormer&#39;s portrayal of Anne in Showtime&#39;s &quot;The Tudors&quot; is absolutely amazing. It is a TV show, so some facts are smudged, but overall the spirit of the true events (and especially fiery Anne!) shines through. For Natalie Dormer alone, I highly recommend it.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaIn fact, the true story of Queen Anne Boleyn is much more fascinating anyway! She was not a witch, she was not a monster! She was a girl in a situation -- and would become a woman madly in love with her husband, as he most definitely loved her. She was a strong, ridiculously intelligent woman who helped spur many important political reformations, without which we would be living in a very different world -- and people have no idea! It&#39;s so sad. :(
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaUgh. My problem with this movie is not the acting (I&#39;ve always loved Natalie Portman), it&#39;s the fact that it (and most especially the &quot;novel&quot; it came from) is absolute trash, historically. It&#39;s basically the EXTREME tabloid version of the twisted basic facts of the time period. If more people knew the ACTUAL story, it wouldn&#39;t bother me so much -- but the fact that people read/see this and believe it&#39;s true... it makes me sick. :( 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome. i saw it first and fell in love, then i heard about the book. the book is everything more than i excepted. i read it. and now i am disapointed in movie, because so litlle facts are the same. it seems like its just the other story, not the same about boylen. 
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@xxxhannahxzx 
I think it is because they could not follow the book one-hundred-percent.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@MisDisneyVideos lmfao like always i love romances in the olden dats

NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@reka0910 it&#39;s called &quot;here comes the king&quot; by X-ray dog :)
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@binibibo LOL!!!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaDoes someone know the name of the music?

NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@lanoon811 yeah but some of the details are changed around a little bit
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitais this movie based on a true story?? did it really happen?
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@mewminto4eva actually, when the story is supposed to take place, henry would have been in his late twenties. around the time he was actually very handsome, though whether that is by today&#39;s standard is not something i know. it wasn&#39;t until he got a little older that he started to get fat and sick and gross lol.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaOoo, David Morrissey in a dodgy wig lol.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaI Love this Fckn Movie (:
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaoh i wonder how this will end
oh! oh i know! 
Anne dies!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaIf you&#39;ve seen the previews you&#39;ve seen the movie; it really wasn&#39;t that good. Watch The Tudors...Natalie Dormer does an amazing job in the role of Anne Boleyn.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitai really have to watch this! love scarlett!!!!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitathe movie was very powerful, loved it through and through
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@EverlastingxHope It&#39;s called &#39;Here comes the king&#39; by X-Ray Dog
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitawow looks like an awesome movie!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@Medusa0999   yeh true ... good point :D
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaHenry VIII was still a honey during this time peroid so it&#39;s fine to have a hot guy lol
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie!
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@LCF1996 
Thank you for the reply, but I&#39;ve found the score I wanted :) It&#39;s called Here Comes The King, and is originally the trailer theme for The Chronicles Of Narnia.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@EverlastingxHope Oh I know, it still is a good movie though. I&#39;m just a huge historian.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know the name of this trailer music?
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@nataliedormerfan 
Well I don&#39;t think the book or the movie was made in the first place to be a documentary.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@mikertones its just ann and mary&#39;s family name &quot;ann boleyn&quot; and &quot;mary boleyn&quot;.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitawat is a boleyn
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@binibibo i have yet to rave about george (Jim surgess). most likely the hottest guy in the movie.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitaReally good movie! Even though historically it was pretty bad.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@xxxhannahxzx It is a serious movie but a hot guy is much more pupular 2 look at. Haha
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing! REALLY really good, even though I hardly know the historical story! :P
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@binibibo if this wasnt such a serious movie, then it would be interesting. hahaha
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@xxxhannahxzx    Yeah he was. But it wouldn&#39;t be so interesting with a fat guy it would be kind of disgusting.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitathat was a good movie
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitawasnt king henry the eighth fat? i remember doing my seventh grade projecto n him.
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever
NX0LoorqtRMdelimeterByIshita@seriewatch Here Comes The King By X-Ray Dog and Lucius Dei By Immediate Music

yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaShit.. this gonna be some epic type movie ...
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a very good action flick. Kevin Costner is refreshingly different than usual in this one! Actually looking forward to see this.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen this movie hundreds of times before
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaMan I love the trailer. hahaha
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitahmmm I bet the blonde woman is the antagonist in the end...
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitathat blonde chick ruined it her acting doesn&#39;t convince me booo
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitamidlife crisis Kev?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaSo glad to see Costner kicking ass again!!! 
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI hate it when trailers ruin movies with so much spoiler clips...!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitawe need Liam
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaamber heard makes me turn on in her every movie
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitapoor man&#39;s Lian neeson
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaIm so totally seeing this movie!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaTypical Action Thriller Movie: Number 2098
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS REALLY CHEESY!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitalooks like Taken 3
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaNatalia Kills - Problem  song from trailer
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaHe aint no liam nelson
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaBoring version of Crank and Taken in one movie :P
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks a lot like a mix of every recent Liam Neeson movie, NO ONE CAN REPLACE LIAM!!!!!! NO ONE!!!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the song??
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitasong please? lol<br>=
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaAmber Heard is other worldly hot but possibly one of the worst actresses on the planet.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaDid they just try to replace Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaoh gosh, We have already seen this plot soooo many times...
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson as Kevin Costner!!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaHailee Steinfeld!!!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitai came here for amber heard. and then i came
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaParis. Daughters. Guns and death. Aww, Kevin Costner trying to be Liam Neeson.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitai like that kind of strong and tough sound of someone in movie stories :D
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThe bodyguard kicking ass now welcome back
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitamission impossible 20 years later :)
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s CHRISTMAS not holiday!! Damn this punk ass country!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaIm glad liam nesson didnt get picked for this role i cant imagine him being funny
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaSo Kevin Costner is playing Ethan Hunt on Crank with 3 Days to Kill?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie deserves more views .
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI Heard Amber&#39;s box office poison 
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitawell Amber Heard is an odd choice for casting...glad Kevin C is back though
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaSOMEONE tell me what to think about this.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshita&quot;3 days to kill&quot; is a terrible title.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitawow copy of taken
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of taken  
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaAmber Heard is such a lovely blonde but she should  focus on her acting skills to get critics&#39; attention.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a sweet action flick.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaDéjà ne serait ce qu&#39;en ayant vu le logo Europacorp au début je me suis refroidi mais alors la ... Kevin Costner veut se la jouer en mode Taken et Malavita ou quoi ?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitai hear sam fisher!!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaWhat`s the song?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI thought that was Dakota fanning 
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitalooks like it&#39;s also a Hailee Steinfeld movie
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at the end of the Trailer?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaeverybody needs money evin Kevin does
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaIt just a rip-off of Taken and every other spy movie. Why cant Amber Heard have her own movie? She would make a great female protagonist in a her own film.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitacostner s a badass
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshita<br>mah
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaUber Kool 
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaEthan as a name for a main character?... in an action movie?  I&#39;ve never heard of that.  That sounds IMPOSSIBLE.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThis, actually, looks pretty funny. Might give it a watch.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaAmber Heard, Kevin Costner: funny duo... Looks ok to me, i like that kind of movie: easy to watch, action and Kevin Costner.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks decent! :)
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaugh yet another agent badass movie with hot &quot;sidekick&quot;... not watching this movie
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitain the thumbnail she looked like Dakota Fanning
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaA secret agent called Ethan? Can&#39;t see that as part of a successful franchise...
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaSo... Kevin Costner wants to be Liam Neeson?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaamber heard is obviously the twist in this movie... she&#39;s defenly going to be bad
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI watch everything with amber in it, the movies are never good, but what the hell
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA &quot;hello i am a guido&quot;
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThere must be a word for that special kind of blandness that only Luc Besson is capable of. Taken, Transporter, From Paris With Love, Colombiana, Banlieue 13 and now this. It&#39;s like he&#39;s selling us the same film over and over (and over (and yet over!)) again.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Audi has bought every fricking movie these days... geez
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yswZKfnmf7c&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> thats some bad green screen effect WOW! cant they just do a real drive through?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaNope, not buying this.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaA mcG film = low expectations
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaKevin costner sounds and looks like liam neeson
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaDoesnt matter Amber heard is in , i ll watch this
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaterrific.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaWE GOT A BADASS OVER HERE!!
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitayou are never done working for them unless you are dead ..
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks horrible.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI thought she was dakota fanning
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaNow what would make this movie better is that kevin costner is change to liam neeson :D
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaThe last time I was this excited to watch a Kevin Costner was with the film, Mr Brooks.
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaDances with Bullets
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaTaken 2.5   I Like :)
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaAlguien que sea muy crack y me diga como se llama esta pelicula que vi el trailer..<br>trata de una mina que esta con un pibe, el tipo la quiere matar, violar no me acuerdo, la mina lo termina matando, le revisa la mochila y encuentra como un video o algo asi, lo ve y trataba de una secta o cosas asi, please AYUDA! :D
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m to old for this shit
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitasad movie, so much killing :/
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks fun. :) 
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song?
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaAmber Heard Nuff Said
yswZKfnmf7cdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! Can&#39;t wait to see it

JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitabut is it a horror story ?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaMan I remember when this come out I was 14 and was turning 15 two days before it’s release date I was so hyped cause I grew up watching the trilogy, I beg please can we have scream 5 and not a reboot
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaGREAT SCREAM 4 OFFICIAL TRAILER !!!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI came here after they announced scream 5 it’s been ten years 2011 and now they are making scream 5 yess
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaRIP Wes Craven
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI want another scream movie, but without Wes it&#39;s nothing
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaJ mm Aí ou mm vc as oi u mm vc 4
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream 4 is a 2011 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. Produced by Outerbanks Entertainment and distributed by Dimension Films, it is the fourth and final installment in the Scream film series. The film starts an ensemble cast, which includes David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Rory Culkin, Marielle Jaffe, Erik Knudsen, Mary McDonnell, Marley Shelton and Nico Tortorella. The film take place on the fifteenth anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders and involves Sidney Prescott returning to the town after ten years, as part of her book tour.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita2019 ? You horror freaks?💀
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who didn&#39;t knew there was a Scream 4? And I watched the first three films. Also this was released way back in 2011. God I must be living in a rock this past 8 years.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was way ahead of its time
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaunfortunately, the movie was made about 5 to 7 years too late and alienated the original audience. The right time to come out would have been after or during the first few Saw movies. Too much emphasis on Ghostface using new tech and charaters that didn&#39;t have the acting range of Billy Loomis, Stu, Mickey, Mrs. Loomis.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaAll the people begging for another Scream, should really ask if we actually need one. Scream 4 ends the series with the main cast triumphing over the remake mentality. Wes Craven resisted giving into that temptation, and even thumbed his nose at the idea by ending 4 the way he did. Sidney said it best &quot;Don&#39;t fuck with the original&quot; And btw Scream 4 didn&#39;t perform well in theaters with the original cast, so a remake or new cast would be inevitable (As they tried with the show). Be careful what you wish for.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaemma roberts was so good in the movie
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitai read that they were supposed to make a scream 5 but Wes Craven’s death happened :( RIP
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaits about a killer that phose you when killeds humans with a knife i love this show but its horror thriler movie a slasher is in town
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaso it is about the mystery killer in the steets in the movie
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaIt’s 2019 and I’m still waiting on some new Scream content.<br>We do get Ghostface as the new Dead by Daylight killer. So that’s exciting.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis would be a real poke in the eye if this were happening in someone&#39;s life.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita5CREAM please.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream 2 and Scream 4 are still decent but the original Scream is still the best and nothing can beat it. The most terrible movie in the Scream franchise is Scream 3
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream Once And <b>4</b> All To Stop This SHIT! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:(
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaCrazy Emma Roberts could still get it.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitai was 10 when i saw this trailer on my mom&#39;s phone!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI love scream but one thing I wonder is how people get the outfit and have the  <del>guts</del> to kill someone. pun intended
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaOh wow, already hitting on 8 years. I remember seeing this trailer in the big screen when my friends and I went to see The Roommate. Man, I had a blast with just watching this alone on the big screen, it was good to hear some of Marco Beltrami&#39;s old SCREAM score in this.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita2019?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitabest horror movie
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKRtyVLWV-E&amp;t=2m25s">2:25</a> Ghostface: I&#39;m coming after you!!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI had know idea. They shouldn&#39;t have.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie came out on my birthday remember wanting to see it in theaters but i was 10
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaWhen they try making a good horror series with a new generation
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream is my favourite movie franchise!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita“When is there gonna be a Scream 5?” Guys...Wes Craven is no longer around.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaHello, I would like to film Scream 13  at THE CRYPT CASTLE...<br>On the MOON...<br>In the Country Of HEAVEN...<br>I would also like Neve Cambell to film STAR MUSICAL 70 woman for Star Wars 10: A Lost Jedi...<br>Thank you SIDney!<br>WITH ME... the SID PIRATE!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaSkeet Ulrich should’ve done a cameo appearance to return as his character Billy alive but a memory
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaSo I&#39;m wondering, for Halloween this year, they&#39;re constantly playing a Scream marathon, yet they never mention or even show the fourth movie. What, did people forget this actually came out or something? O_O
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s on spectrum for free
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI want scream 5 to come out
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita😌
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe it&#39;s been six years.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaWas 4 any good?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitathe original from 1996 always stays the best of the whole franchise. this movie sucked big times
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita666 likes
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this so blurry?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThank goodness it didn&#39;t retract to much to the 3rd movie. It does have some comedy bits in here, but it holds up like the 1st 2 movies. I didn&#39;t like the beginning of the film, but it is really cool after the movie ACTUALLY starts. Neve Campbell, can easily take the Jaime Lee Curtis crown of this movie. If there was a reincarnation of her, Neve does a great job doing that! Just watching makes you feel like you&#39;re sorta watching a Halloween movie, just based on Neve&#39;s age. Neve is very attractive in this movie. She always had something about herself, that didn&#39;t stand out like she wasn&#39;t no Rose McGowen, or Drew Barrymore. In this one though she&#39;s a MILF!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaWho else wants another Scream Movie?<br><br><br>Edit: Oct 2021..... You&#39;re all welcome. 😋
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis film was well made. It&#39;s ending is surprising.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaCan someone please tell me where I could find the deleted scene where Jill screams on the phone at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKRtyVLWV-E&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> please? :).
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching &quot;Scream&quot; in    2018
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaBought watch on netflix now
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaWhy is Stab 3 about returning to Woodsburogh if it&#39;s based on a true story and why is Gale supposed to be the killer in Stab 3, but it says she gets killed 3rd and Gale didn&#39;t doe but they said it&#39;s a true story and why is there a character named Ricky if he&#39;s supposed to play Randy but Randy died in Scream 2, also who the hell is Candy supposed to be in Stab 3 if it&#39;s a true story, and they haven&#39;t been to Woodsburogh since like 1996 and call it Return to Woodsburogh, and I know this because in the beginning of Scream 4 Jenny says the first 3 stab movies were based on a true story
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita2018 anyone?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis is the 4th movie
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaAbout to watch for the first time.  What I like about the Scream films is they never stray from the slasher theme
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitathe music in this TRAILER was better than any of the pieces of score in the film with the exception of Jill in the kitchen at the end.<br><br>it&#39;s so frustrating how much better Scream 4 could have been with a better score. music can make or break a horror movie. there are so many scenes in the film that are pretty much ruined by cheesy music. it was actually distracting at times and gave certain scenes a totally a hokey,  cheap romcom feel. many of the non-action sequences are ruined by that terrible hokey music you hear in many comedies i.e. the scene where Gale puts Rebecca in her place, the scene with Hicks talking to Dewey right before they get called to the murder scene in the beginning, also when Jenny and Marnie are discussing the Stab franchise. the only sequences with decent music were Olivia&#39;s murder (still could have improved), Kirby&#39;s phone call and death, Jill&#39;s self-mutilation (best piece of music and best scene in the film IMO - very GONE GIRL) , Sid and Hicks talking in the hallway before Olivia&#39;s murder, Jill and Sid in Jill&#39;s bedroom with Trevor leaving through the window, Sid and Dewey when he references her book - and a few others (very few) I can&#39;t think of right now. The atmopshere of so many of the scenes could have been much bleaker and dark with the right score
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita2018?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita2017?
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream 4 feels more like the real Scream 3.  Scream 3:  Back To Woodsboro
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaEmma Roberts
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita@yackelineurbaneja si es buena película la he visto
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t find this on amazon
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKRtyVLWV-E&amp;t=02m17s">02:17</a> the scene of Jill screaming into the phone never made it into the movie.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitawho&quot;s watching this in 2016
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaScream is probably one of my favorite slasher films. It&#39;s like every new installment of the movie is exciting because it also means new victims to be killed and of course new mystery killer with a knife.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sick and tired of seeing Neve Campbell and every sequel...
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis is so amazing
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita@randomdancer45 this one.
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaKIRBY is Funny Here.... 
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshita@HaveAScream Well it scared the shit out of my mate, and he&#39;s suppose to be a &quot;tough guy&quot; rugby player haha. xD Scream4 wasn&#39;t a disappointment in my opinion, the new cast mixed in well and it was planned and thought out brilliantly. Bad critics? Who&#39;s says it will get bad critics because one person thinks it wasn&#39;t a horror. When, IT CLEARLY WAS. 

It&#39;s a thumbs UP to Dimension from me!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good, not as good as 1, but still  a worthy sequel 
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitagreat film wes loved it
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI cannot wait! Awesome cast, hot chicks,  witty dialouge, and an awesome screenwriter! The Master Of Suspense: Wes Craven, will make Kevin&#39;s script flourish to life with laughs, and thrills! The cannot fucking wait for April 15, 2011!!!!!!!!!!!!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaThis killer is a lot ballsier then the past one. first he kills ppl &amp; posts the video on the internet. then he changes rules. then to top it off he goes for a kill right in the middle of the street! i am impressed with him so far. ;D
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaomg she forgot sorority row
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitalook a little crappy but i&#39;m still going to see it.

JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited. Been watching these movies since I was little. I doubt this will be as good as the original movies (especially the first), but I&#39;m still going to watch it!
JKRtyVLWV-EdelimeterByIshitaSecond
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaWow, that actress from Bates Motel is really branching out fast!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/2qfmAllbYC8?t=2m12s">2:12</a> OMFG Shane!!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaShane, you&#39;re alive!?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshita\mm/ can&#39;t wait any longer : ))
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m dying to seeeeeeeeee iiiiiiit!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis looks to be a great film
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis book was amazing, it&#39;s coming out a few days after my birthday and i just.... omg
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis is like the fault in stars I little isn&#39;t it 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitais that Sam Bashor?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Thomas Kub from Project X
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaSWEET! Emma from Bates Motel! I&#39;ll watch anything with her in it! Even that awful Ouija movie... THANKFULLY this looks a lot better!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaIs that Jon Berthal at <a href="http://youtu.be/2qfmAllbYC8?t=2m12s">2:12</a>?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaAll these &quot;a walk to remember&quot; rip offs are just pissing me off.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaNice  and pretty cool
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.<br><br>There are lots of teen movies based on books coming out these past few years. Prior to that it seemed like it was a dying genre.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitais that the girl from Bates Motel?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the same girl from Bates Motel, and she&#39;s also dying. 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaCrying and laughing at the same time!!! Wow this movie looks awesome! I didn&#39;t even know the book was being made into a movie, I totally need to read it now! 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaWow! This looks like a classic for this generation. It&#39;s about time that a teen film measures up to the heartfelt films of the 80&#39;s.  I can&#39;t wait to see it!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaeww he fugly
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI wanna seeeeeeeee n.n
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaShoulda cast Earl Sweatshirt.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaNow I actually have to read the book lol :-)
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaShoot her and get it over with.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshita*Earl and I
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitai find thomas mann really attractive like mmmm and but like mmmmmmmmm.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaEarl, The Dying Girl, and I*
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s &quot;Earl and I.&quot;  In addition to the girl, you&#39;re killing the English language.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitathis seems really annoying. it sounds like it&#39;s done from the POV of a 16 year old who thinks they&#39;re above everyone because they&#39;ve seen movies from the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s, and a shoe-horned in homage in the movie to prove it. and I don&#39;t think I could listen to that mono-tone voice for 2 hours. but, I am making huge sweeping judgments on a trailer. who knows.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaOmg why does Olivia keep playing a handicap first Bates Motel now this haha
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshita&quot;But this isn&#39;t a touching romantic story&quot;<br>You are making it near impossible for me to not watch this movie, please at lest don&#39;t make is so good that I can&#39;t wait for it to come on DVD.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI was hoping this would be original but it&#39;s not. Based off a book, and it really makes sense because it&#39;s about a complicated relationship between a high school guy who doesn&#39;t want to be there, a high school girl that has cancer who doesn&#39;t want to be there in a relationship with the guy, and a third wheel that <i>wants</i> to be there. Isn&#39;t this the same regurgitated bullshit you people got last year? Why does this world tolerate unoriginality?<br><br>It&#39;s a lot easier for Hollywood and &quot;artists&quot; to copy something exactly, and the public has no problem with it because they are too pussy to crave something different. The world is just too chaotic isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ll have you know this is the most peaceful time in history coming off the Middle Ages. They had to deal with famine, pandemics, a devastating apocalyptic war between the greatest powers in Europe and still people were more intellectually progressive than today.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaIs this a partial satire of the fault in our stars? If so, YES please.<br>p.s. great book and was SOOO EXCITED when i found out they were making a movie
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitadoes she die
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI love the concept of this, but I&#39;m worried it will be like a John Green book.<br><br>P.S. that is not a compliment.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis is pretty much forcing me to read the book now....
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaSO GOD DAMN EXCITED FOR THIS. Funniest book I have ever read.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI loveeeeeee this book, I made a viedo review about it on my channel (is in spanish).<br>I&#39;m really looking forward see this movie, but I don&#39;t think they premiere it in Mexico :/
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThe girl who had cancer in this movie has cancer in Bates Motel lol
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitathere better be an epic bromance in this movie
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaSo exited for this, it looks brilliant.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaLooks great but the title is terrible. 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis seems like a better movie than the Fault of Our Stars.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI wanna see this movie, just to see who shane was before he moved to atlanta, and the zombie outbreak happen.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaMan, the fuck happened to Thomas Mann after Project X. This is the first I&#39;ve heard of him since.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitathis looks a million times better than The Fault in Our Stars
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshita&quot;Punk ass cat&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS BRILLIANT
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks perfect! This is the type of movie I want to make one day.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI think I&#39;m willing to be manipulated by this weepie
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer was really good i couldnt stop watching it 10 times
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI saw Matt3756 and Shane from The Walking Dead!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is releasing on my birthday and I&#39;m kinda freaking out! I loved this book so much!!!!! ❤️
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SO FVCKING EXCITED THIS IS LEGIT MY FAVORITE BOOK
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaDid she loose all of her hair?? That&#39;s just sad. I wish cancer never existed. Shout out to all those people who had cancer and died everyone always wishes you are still here. Cancer was something that was never meant to be. 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaHeyy that&#39;s the dude from Project X 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaSaw this at Sundance in January. Absolutely astonishing piece of film. Every character and every scene is so imaginatively detailed and real, you could really tell just how much thought and care went into each and every detail. Incredible team accomplishment, truly.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaGot the cat part on loop. 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitayou had me at &quot;this isn&#39;t a touching romantic story&quot;<br><br><br>also Nick Offerman
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitame, you, and my penis
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaWow<br><br>Rotten Tomatoes: 100%<br>Imdb: 8/10<br>Sundance Grand Jury Prize<br>Sundance Audience Award<br><br>Should I watch it?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis actually looks like a promising movie!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaWhy does every movie character with cancer have a death sentence? Leukemia, especially, is very treatable. What kind of message does this send to every single child and teen that is diagnosed with cancer? Not that this is a challenge that they can overcome and grow from, but rather a guarentee of their quick demise. At least once, can we please live? Can we grow from our turmoil and bloom into happy, satisfied people with an interesting story to tell? Cancer is hard enough without every example in pop culture telling you you&#39;re on your deathbed.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis just become my most anticipated film of the year
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitathis looks really good actually..
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitathis looks so goood!!!

2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaHeard great things, and it looks awesome.<br>I hope it comes to my theaters.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI was a goth extra in this film for about 6 days and it was one of the best experiences on a film set I&#39;ve ever had. You can tell people&#39;s hearts were in it when making this film. It&#39;s gonna be amazing! Hope to see more of me when the movie comes out!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!! :D
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThe user by the name of Shokan Prince can fuck himself.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaOkay, I&#39;m laughing &amp; crying at the same time...that&#39;s a good thing right?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!! ❤️❤️❤️
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThe song in the 2nd half of the trailer is THE BIG SHIP by master of atmospheric music Brian Eno. Yes. he is the film&#39;s composer. Yes, the track is used masterfully in the film. Yes, you will fucking cry.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at the end?
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so proud and excited for the world to see this!!!!!!!! 
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaBeen waiting for this trailer since forever! So beyond excited for this film looks incredible just like the book!
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaPeople who disliked Fault in Ours Stars would want to watch this. People who liked Fault in Our Stars would absolutely love this if they give it a chance.<br><br>People who watched this not only said it is one of the best teen movies ever, but one that will forever be etched into our memories as the new definitive teen film.
2qfmAllbYC8delimeterByIshitaLooks both fun and depressing, sort of like &quot;The fault in our stars&quot;, but this premise seems more interesting
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaTrailer is shit?

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaA masterpiece ❤️👍
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitathis trailer looks horrible but the movie itself made quite good...

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitahow to show a whole movie in a trailer<br>what idiot made this trailer?
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaQuem veio de  lá do grupo do face???? Kkkikkk
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaDamn...this movie. I was actually emotional at the end. Trailer gives away way too much, though.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaFantastic movie! And for those complaining about subtitles 🤫 🥴
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaI feel drained after this movie.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a great movie!

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gives away so much of the movie
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaThe beat is a total vibe
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitai happen to catch this movie one night, insomnia, and never was able to find it on cable again. Awesome movie!
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitathis movie is brilliant on so many levels, people obsessed by ego and power yet the victim shows us that identity can be preserved even if the physical is destroyed. antonio is great at playing god and the devil at the same time. really a masterpiece.

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaim gonna watch it soon...but i think it his inspired by a French movie called Les Yeux Sans Visage.... a old black &amp; white movie....great movie but a little bit light so i got to watch this to see if i am right and foreign movie are a real treat for me can&#39;t wait to watchthis and to do a review
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaBello
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaMe gusta<br>
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaI have to eat my words... because the trailer in Spanish is exactly the same! Too bad.

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaThe film is OK, but the trailer doesn&#39;t make justice. In fact, I have noticed that Almodovar&#39;s films use to have very bad trailers in the US. I guess this is because his films are in a foreign language and they don&#39;t want trailers with subtitles
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitadisturbing...but great story. just disturbing...
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaFilm in spanish and i fed up reading subtitle,its a great film
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the music here?

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitathe film can get confusing at points but it is so worth watching
especially the ending

PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was...wow.  Especially if you didn&#39;t see the trailer first.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaMusic : Trentemoller  - Shades Of Marble (Original Mix)
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitamusic plz?
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaLoe this trailer unique and vague just the way I like it!
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was KookyCrazyGood....Love foreign films.. 
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve just seen this movie, and even if it&#39;s really weird (Almodovar style), this is one of the best I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Original story! 
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaGod, I can&#39;t believe how many people are complaining about subtitles. Is reading a lost art in America?
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaTrentemøller was an awesome choice for this trailer
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaok...the fact that this thing is in spanish should have been mentioned...i am VERY unhappy with trailers that leave out dialogue because the intention is to suck in people who do NOT speak the f&quot;&quot;king language...
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshita@Andraeseus Translations rape movies. God bless subtitles.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaYes you can watch with sub Tittles but i am just letting every one know. all you see here is about the great reviews and I dont want some one to buy it based on the reviews people need to know it is IN ALL SPANISH! thats not very clear so I am just making it clear. and subtittles are annoying some times. BUt i am learning spanish so I will prob watch it anyway
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaAwwww.... I was about to watch it right now but i don&#39;t understand spanish. :( 
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE IS IN ALL SPANISH. IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH AND CAN NOT UNDERSTAND SPANISH DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! DO NOT!!!!
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaUh.. don&#39;t watch it then lol!  
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie last night. Really amazing!
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshita@Andraeseus Well, I can&#39;t speak Spanish either. It&#39;s not a problem, just read. I mean, synchronization just rapes movies man.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshita@bluedjules if i can only speak english. i dont know if there are sub titles. even so... subtitles are a little bit more annoying. I can speak very little spanish.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshita@Andraeseus Is that a problem?
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshita@roseclouds yeah but you only realize the significance of certain scenes after watching the film 
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaAmazing film. Easily the best I&#39;ve seen this year.
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitais it all in spanish?
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitajust saw the movie... what a fantastic film... the academy ough to take notice with this and Martha Marcy May Marlene... goodness!
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s like if les yeux sans visage was directed by david cronenberg. Great trailer though. 
PavJUoZNT7gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like quite a Drama, look forward to it
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m willing to bet all the action in the trailer is all that there is in the movie, too.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaand there&#39;s always the fact tht if God is omnipotent, he cud just like blow up Earth, or kill all ppl.....why send an army of angels if hes so powerful? O.o
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalmao ur funny dats sooooo true i just always forget WHERE my block button is lol ;))
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol u got a good point but imma see it even if i have to give an arm AND a leg lol :)
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI bet the main angel that is there to help is Satan, and the child that is humanity&#39;s &quot;savior&quot; is the anti-christ, but you won&#39;t know that till the end of the movie. It will be like one of those messed up endings where you were rooting for the wrong team and humanity is screwed. But, then again, its hoolywood.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaIt looks pretty good. I have seen much movies about angels. I have seen a couple.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaHmmm good call.  X3
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaWell he curses first. Lol

Second, would you want your religious Icon bashed at oversomething they don&#39;t understand?
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaSo are you.

GO fuck yourself.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita10,000 people of each country who imigrated in America and live here for religion, freedom. blah blah and rights.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis  movie  looks awesome to watch .
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sounds as if they make GOD the vilian. Even though its just a trailer the hole concept is wrong from the door. The movie is a slap in the face to Chrstain fath.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaPersonally, i think in a world where someone can say &quot;Christianity is the DOMINANT religion&quot; anything is possible. I will watch it only because it seems like a rather interesting movie with a somewhat unique concept. P.S I am not an Atheist nor am I very religious, I just like movies because hell....PRODUCERS ARENT TRYING TO CALL ME A DEVIL WORSHIPPER ONLY BECAUSE I DONT GO TO CHURCH... :-)
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is plain evil!! It is sad what this world is coming to! :&#39;[ I will not watch it! A movie that mocks God should be banned in a world in which Christianity is the dominant religion!!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaOMG grandma was funny. I want to see this movie ! Hopefully its gonna be theaters here in The Netherlands too
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks so stupid and great
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitait looks like constantine and I am Legend
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaHmm, well pretty much the only time Angels show up is when they are either killing someone or bringing bad news . . . or bringing the end to all mankind. The only times they didn&#39;t were to tell someone they were pregnant. Overall, angels are bad news.

But hey, what would I know, I&#39;m just an Atheist.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaShit, that old lady scared the shit out of me .. . too much coffee, too late.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaholy fuck that was sick
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol.........it really looks so doesnt it???
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gonna do great on DVD.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know the writers of Super Natural were making a movie.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a good popcorn movie as long as you dont take it to seriously or look for it to make to much sense.  i might check it out.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita&quot;But your BABY! It&#39;s gonna BURN!&quot; hahaha
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaangels and demons was never about angels and demons.  It was about a professor who tries to stop the destruction of the catholic church from a secret society called the illuminati
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaSo God is so incompetent that he can&#39;t even off a few people armed with assault rifles? Really? Guess he should have gone with the flood again. This looks like one of those movies where they write a non-sensical plot around a special effect.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks just like The Prophecy movies. And I gotta be honest, I loved those movies, even the crappy sequels.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathat freaking scared the hell out of me when the old lady was like BURN that shit
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThere is a reason this is being released in January!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a horrible movie
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaIts gonna suck bad. It ain&#39;t even a movie about the demon Legion and they put angels in as an army against humanitY? SUCKS!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitasame here, the stretchy daemon on the other hand..  i lawled...
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitawould you feel better if the baby came out black? just cause shes white doesnt mean that the baby is going to be white

i for one hope the baby is born and turns out asian... and the movie ends when everyone says &quot;really?!&quot;
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitauhh are we sure those are angels?
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalooked like bad acting. some not-to-well-known actors. and whats up with the plot? god hates us so he sends his angels down to kill us and they look demonic? what is this shit. gods suppose to be loving and shit. hell we put our fate in him and he sends butt monkeys down to kill us. weirdly scary plot for a movie. i might see it for some shits and giggles but thats about it.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaCouldn&#39;t agree more.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks cool.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitagrandma scared me soooo bad! i jumped!

but this looks freaky and scary, yet really good!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks good.. and don&#39;t be hatting on movies. just bc u like 13 candels..
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks unbelievably stupid...
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathe best movies come out in january...
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to this one
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathe hero is an archangel, an angel who defied god
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalove the theme... creepy grandma and stretchy-arm gave me the chills.(everyone&#39;s sleeping... everything&#39;s very quiet... and then this trailer happened *gasp)
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathat grandma scared the daylights out of me! talk about a surprise!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaTerminator + Army Of Darkness= Box Office Gold... lol
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitauh God made them all. Does this mean the baby&#39;s satan? o_O
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Demon Knight!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaSpyhunter you are lame, if you dont like movies then dont leave comments on their trailers, movie looks intresting
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaa fight against God? really...?

yet oddly enough, i will go see it lol.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitai did!
:( was mad when i realised it wasnt
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitai actually think the whole an angel decides the fate of humanity is original
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaisnt this kind of like....every other movie created in the past 10 years.....
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaGabriel looks sooooooooo badass! fuck, he&#39;s probably the only reason why i&#39;ll go see this movie.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI agree....I just couldnt breathe.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaHollywood has mindless with absolutely no creativity writers. They&#39;re shaking their heads wondering &#39;How did a movie like District 9 pull in so many viewer and cash?&#39;

I stopped going to the theater because all this garbage crap with no creativity or originality. It&#39;s a remake remake of remake of another movie. You ever seen scorcher fake trailer? That&#39;s hollywood!!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaQue ironico, Salvados por un angel caido del cielo. que tematica tan chingona!!!!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol evil granny
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitait wasn&#39;t a bet.. Lucifer asked God for permission first then said I can get Job to lose faith in you. God gave Job twice as much land, family, crops and animals.  God doesn&#39;t need to bet.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol truggs what were you on acid when you &quot;heard&quot; this happened wake the fuck up you fool
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalmao looks like a HUGEEEEEE piece of shit
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaCup of wtf.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitai agree this film is total bullshit
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita&quot;According to the book of Job he made a bet with Lucifer that he couldnt bend his belief in God so Lucifer slaughtered Job&#39;s cattle crops and family.&quot;

this wasnt a &quot;bet&quot; God doesnt make bets. Lucifer went to God and asked him for PERMISSION to do what he did to Job. God wont ever give us anything we cant handle. That is what the moral of the story is.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaLooks completely heretical.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThats what Angels do. They where sent to do Gods will. Whenever God wanted somebody killed he sent them. According to the book of Job he made a bet with Lucifer that he couldnt bend his belief in God so Lucifer slaughtered Job&#39;s cattle crops and family. I dont believe in all that stuff but the stories are fantastic!!!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaGod is not the good 1. The 4th commandment keep the sabbath day holy do no work. Same book Exodus 31 14 whoever works on the sabbath shall be put to death. 1 of many reasons god is not the good 1.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks....alright...god enough to see but not good enough to run out on opening day. Although what i want to see more than this is the religous fanatics protest it =)
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaTo be honest... this looks like shit!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitamy gosh!!..AWESOME!..unusual plot but still..AWESOME!..
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks kick ass idk wat u guys are talking about.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThis kinda reminds me of Dogma lol
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitacomplains complain and yet you guys will still see it just because
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalooks really good in my opinion even though i dont quite believe in it all
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaClassic wings , classic impressions 
omg !!!  hate this bullshit
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaagree. look like shit!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitareally stupid
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaThe 4 legged creatures looked cool, but these types of movies always look a bit promising and turn out to be poop. Also, I only recognized one actor (Dennis Quaid) and I wish they would give the angels some realistic-sized wings.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitawhat does &quot; &lt;3 &quot; mean? It looks like saggy boobs.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaKevin Durand (The Blob-X Men Origins) is one kick ass angel in black. I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s the bad guy in this movie. He&#39;s awesomely cool.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI *knew* I shouldn&#39;t have set up Grandma with her first internet service last week.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitai thought angels were nice and have a halo with bright lights shining behind them. =[
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks really stupid starting with that old ladie
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaone might think a giant meteorite would be more practical ... :/
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitagabriel .
wow.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitanoway .!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita...THE HECK WAS THAT?!?!?!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaAre you serious? That old lady&#39;s hilarious, haha.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita1:33 - 1:35
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol 1:33
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!!!!! (When it comes out on video) I was told it is based on a true story. It really happened a couple of years ago.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitasuper effects look bad for a 21st century.
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshita0:18 lol paradise falls reminds me of fallout 3
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitawow it will be awesome
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitalol i know i was WTF!!
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitawell, another &quot;apocalypse&quot; movie, this time with zombie-grannys, strange spider-like-truck-drivers and men with wings and armour ...
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitathis looks fuckin epic
P6p01-in6-kdelimeterByIshitaholy shit grandma u CRAZY
and btw isnt there gonna be another like Day Ending movie? i forgot whats it calld (dont reply telling me the movie i&#39;ll probably remember)
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaWhy would ANYBODY want to remake a movie like this?!  I saw like.... 10 minutes of the original and I had to turn it off, it was by far the most gruesome movie I&#39;ve ever seen... and I&#39;ve seen some pretty gruesome movies.  I don&#39;t even know why anybody would make this movie to begin with.  It&#39;s... horrible... exploitive... disgusting 
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitafuck it.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitait seems like all they do anymore is make remakes of great films cant hollywood come up with something orginal
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@abrnt1 -

Agreed! The original was so brutal and ugly I felt like taking a bath to wash the filth off. This will be ALOT like the Last House remake-not effective at all in keeping the bankable R-rating. &quot;Chaos&quot; was 10 times better than the Last House remake.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitait actually looks JUST like the last house on the left.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaOk so now we&#39;re down to remaking awful slasher movies from the 70&#39;s. Hollywood is officially bankrupted of new ideas. I saw the original  flick. It was sick and not in a good way. Why the hell would anyone want to re-make this? I wouldnt even rent this on dvd.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be Some Ol&#39; Bullshit!!!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of last house on the left for some reason
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitahopa
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaNo!not another remake of a horror-slasher movie from the 1970&#39;s or &#39;80&#39;s(I&#39;m goin&#39; go hang myself,j/k).I know,it&#39;s for generation &quot;Y&quot;(people 15-23 or born during the late &#39;80s-early 2000&#39;s.They refuse to watch their parent&#39;s era of movies).Don&#39;t get me wrong,I finally saw the original 1978  first time in 2005,from reading reviews in horror movie magazines during the &#39;90s-2000s and remember the vhs video cover during the &#39;80s.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@hanspeterpitsch excuse me, 32 years
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@JustMineES buy it, it&#39;s 40 years old
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@comedyman112 

1. It&#39;s a good title
2. It&#39;s a remake
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t the female in the ORIGINAL  BLACK... WTF!!!!!!!!!!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitai prefer the original movie
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaHow about we see the movie before judging it...
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaLast House on the left and many other movies
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@marvelousmoviemaster  I think so
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaHollywood hasn&#39;t had an original idea in 30 years.  That&#39;s why Asian cinema is where it&#39;s at!!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaoh wow its almost EXACTLY like the last house on the left...when are they going to stop making shitty remakes especially on movies that are all about rape we dont need to see this! its actually known for its brutal rape scenes! ugh....
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitawow this is a major fail already they ruined the film and this is just a trailer
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaoh no....Another remake of a classic movie....and there gonna fuck it up!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaYeah, uh no. Trailer does not look at least one bit interesting but hey if word about the movie is nice....It..might be worth some space on my hard drive lol. Maybe! I&#39;m not paying for this.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitacause this totally does not look like Last House On the Left and The Strangers at all! Bullshit, write some original horror for people to enjoy! There is nothing intelligent about this.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@FanOfAll Gotcha,,and now iknow,i totally stand behind my origional comment,,thanx for the amazing explanation =]
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitait doesn&#39;t look as brutal as the original.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitathe joke&#39;s on them, cause i&#39;m not paying even one dollar to see this
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaforgive me father for i will troll!
FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE and ... ok not gay but still FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@ADZ23774 basically, part of postmodern ideology dictates that there is no originality in culture any more, it&#39;s just not possible. 

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else&#39;s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.

Technically that quote was said 100 years too early to count but the ideas the same. Oscar Wilde FTW
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@FanOfAll not sure wotcha mean so i gotta agree lol!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@dgnx69 Not because the content will be any different, but because society itself has been desensitized, which I support.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaAaaah.. Karma. =)
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaYES!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitadude i love plots like this the victim turns into the person owning =]
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitanss is gay
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaWonder what happens when you break up with a girl like that
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaDo producers just have a hat with the names of classic horror films in it close their eyes, dip their hand in and whatever they pull out gets greenlit for a remake?
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaif they are gonna remake it do it right! this is tame and made for little girls to make them feel like they are impowered if anything this will make more rapist and more unjustified claims to rape!  the original one showed the true horror of rape and contributed to stop such ppl commiting such a crime... this is just a chick flick about empowerment horse shit
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitafuck this movie. this trailer made me so angry and i want the director&#39;s motherfucking head on my doorstep tomorrow morning
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitalooks promising but it needs 2 be unratedor nc17 to have the samepunch.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaI have a feeling this is going to be WAY too sterile for a remake of I Spit On Your Grave.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaOh no here we go, how the fuck could they remake the original. Looks fucking terrible, the original was brutal, this looks crap. well at least the value of my daybill poster of the original will go up in value.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitais this a joke?
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaaouts
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t believe they&#39;re remaking this. sigh. cut it out, hollywood. just admit defeat already.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaI like recycling stuff. BUT NOT LIKE THIS! :O
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@ADZ23774 that&#39;s post modernism for you
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@dgnx69 yeh,i was just saying that to the missus
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaanother re-make,the origional was class,all though i bet if i watched it now,it wont have dated too well,the thing is,are there no origional ideas anymore???If its not a book,or a comic,or graphic novel,its a remake,where has all the inspiration gone?
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaerrmm dunno why but hell yeah i like thaat !!!! it&#39;s bout time that girls would actually do something bout themselves !!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaI got a feeling that this remake isn&#39;t gonna be as shocking as the original
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitahaha getting beaten up by a girl .. Fail.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita........okay lets get it out of the way.

Ungodly Generic Crossing of &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot; and &quot;Saw&quot;
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaIt a differnet spin
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitathe years worst movie has arrived
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitalooks lame the original was more hardcore
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@OBAMA5708 u r so fucking right, it looks crap.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaa remake of an exploitation flick . . . but will it be in 3D??
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitayay a 100 pound girl going on a killing spree.. yea right
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaomfg this is my catchphrase!

2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitawow...i was just thinkin bout writing a story like this the other day...smt, well so much 4 that idea
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita@ginaswo I Fart in Your General Direction
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitathis will be cool movie
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaThe original wuz crazy and this don&#39;t contradict it self she wuz gang raped by several men she gets them one at a time unsupected not all at once!
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaSo where was all this power when she getting raped and all that? It seems like a straight enough movie, but it contradicts itself. Guess I gotta see it to figure out how she just all of sudden awesome chick at revenge.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks sooo bad
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaOMG!! I want to see this movie
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitameh

2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaehhhh.....
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaof course they would make it bloody just like very other damn movie
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita10 to 1 they take all the psychosis out, and just turn it into blood&#39;n guts Hostel/Saw with a little girl.  Yet another old Cinema Nastie that shouldn&#39;t be touched.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a cross between Kill Bill and Saw.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaIf every one is young and had never heard of this movie go and check out the 1978 version

2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshitaAnother god-damn remake! I am slowly getting tired of this.
2zU3U-9B3fEdelimeterByIshita..... :O
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaokay so why did a two minute trailer make me cry
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaOMG LUPITA AND MIRA NAIR!! This movie is going to be awesomee!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to make zero money man wtf. If they are going to base it on a true story then show the rebellions, slaughters, kidnappings, wars, gold rushes, fuck it even go back to the past with the moors and how they fought against the Spaniards or   something with more bang so people would actually be interested.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaok so 2 problems i have with this movie. Who the fuck on Earth wants to see a movie about Africans playing chess? Why are we always showing the slums of African and not the suburbs or upper class areas? Literally every single African movie shows the slums and never the other part, thats like showing Compton over Beverly Hills.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAm really anticipating for the movie. I want o see how story is brought out.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s about time! this is going to be amazing
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI hope this gets multiple nominations and wins at the Oscars next year. If they don&#39;t, I&#39;m gonna really get angered and will call for a tune-out of the currently so-white Oscars.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited....cant wait for september
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaBold move Disney... <b>I&#39;ll be watching.</b>
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaIt seems like a lot of people are excited about this movie but how many of you are actually going to go out and see it in theaters? Disney doesn&#39;t mind making diverse films like this but at the end of the day Disney is a billion-dollar corporation that really cares about profits so if people don&#39;t go out and see the movie Disney wont keep making movies like this!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaProud to be Ugandan!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitagod i cried
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaBig Up UG.

z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AMAZING IM CRYING THANK YOU DISNEY
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaSo with all the issues plaguing the continent of Africa Disney makes a movie about playing chess? Why not a movie about Kevlin Doe who is using scraps to bring electricity to his village in Sierra Leone?
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaDamn you Disney! Making me happy in such a dismal economy.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaQueen Leona Lewis.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful.  I can hardly wait.  :-)
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAmazing, i&#39;ll def. watch it...but this trailer seems so spoling...
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaOmg her story was one of my open response readings for mcas
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaProudly African from Uganda 💪🏾
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI REALLY REALLY REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS Movie! 😍😍😍 I really do not fancy Sport or Game Movies but THIS Movie looks amazing and good! :D :D :D Plus this Trailer made me cry because it was beautiful and the Leona Lewis Song made it powerful! 😭😭😭💜💜💜
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaPourquoi il n&#39;y a pas de sortie française ...... ? -.-
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer looks awesome, such an interesting story. And I literally screamed when I listened Think Skin by Leona Lewis (from her recent srudio álbum &quot; I Am&quot; during the trailer). So glad!!<br><br>Btw, I love Lupita!!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mustwatch">#mustwatch</a>
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLupitaaaaaa , I love her !
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaWow xx
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAn ESPN film
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaWhy do men assume they&#39;re better at everything because they&#39;re men? She&#39;s facing sexism in the chess community? LMAO!😂😂
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaYasss
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks so amazing!  And Lupita, love her, so talented!!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!! This will change the game I can&#39;t wait
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLove this story, love the song used for this ad. Leona Lewis-thick skin perfect fit for this theme
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLupita!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely going to watch this, so proud of my African sister :&#39;)
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI never knew chess could make such a difference in someone&#39;s life! I want to see it so badly!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaSocial commentary: Why can&#39;t black move first?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just kidding. Looks like a nice, fun movie. A film about black people that&#39;s not related with slavery or colonialism is always welcome.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks good. I wish they wouldn&#39;t have shown that she wins that tournament... And that song is uninspired vapid crap but it is a disney movie so...
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaVery excited for this movie looks great!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThat looks awesome!!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI am a grown ass man I&#39;m crying like a 10 year old... and its only the trailer , wtf!!! I am sooo watching this
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLeona Lewis Slaying with her vocal with the theme song &quot;Thick Skin&quot; her voice is a rare gem.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLeona Lewis&#39; Thick skin goes so well with this trailer!  Love this song by the most underrated artist in the music industry!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLoved the music Thick Skin by Leona Lewis :) <br>The movie looks great too!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThank you Disney for making this movie!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks INCREDIBLE 😍
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful. so beautiful 💜💜💜💜
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI love the fact she is an African and has a strong heart.#Tearsofjoy
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThese are the kind of films that needs to be shown to the kids as opposed to the films featuring Miley, Selena, or the Jonas Brothers for that matter.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so intense, so beautiful!<br>I think it will be really inspiring. &quot;In chess the small one, can become the big one.&quot;<br>A lesson all of us should learn, that even when we think we&#39;re small, that we can become something bigger. Every humnan being is important and can archieve something :)
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis is not supposed to sound racist: Disney finally made a movie with African Americans, but it&#39;s about chess... CHESS! Of all things, they pick chess! And they managed to make this movie racist with the chess pieces!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitathis looks good
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAwesome cast...waiting for the movie
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaTrailer made me cry I dont know if I can survive the whole movie. Also this is not only speaks to the Africans, this is for all the people who wants to do big things with their lifes but can&#39;t because of the countries they live in, so powerful. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshita7 Dislikes?
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy because I&#39;m from Uganda😀😀😀 can&#39;t wait to see this!!

z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaSong is Thick Skin by Leona Lewis.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like such a beautiful film! I cant wait to see it :)
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaWhen the trailer gives you enough feels to cry... I&#39;m going to love this movie
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaOMGGG <br>THIS SONG IS <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ThickSkin">#ThickSkin</a> by Leona Lewis 💞💞
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaAnd I`m crying.This looks so lovely.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing. I want to learn more stories about amazing people like Phiona Mutesi from all around the world. Glad to see Disney doing some different and refreshing in Hollywood.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitalooks like a beautiful film! and I love the fact that they used Leona Lewis&#39; song &quot;Thick Skin&quot; which is one of my favorite songs by her &lt;3
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaNo doubt this is gonna make me cry. And I don&#39;t cry on a lot of movies.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI have goosebumps.... proudly African
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitacant wait!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaLupita Nyong&#39;o and David Oyelowo in a movie together! Awesome!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitasometimes the place where you used to live is where you&#39;re not belong.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaThank you Disney for creating such a film. Thank you for showing the world that we can be powerful and moving. Thank you for showing that we have a story that need to be told and are not sterotypes, so thank you. I be looking forward to seeing the breathtaking film.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitadoes Disney support transgender bathrooms for africa?
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitabeautiful. simply beautiful. I can&#39;t wait for the realized l.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited for this!!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshita😍 i love the story !
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaDisney, I haven&#39;t been this impressed with an original live-action movie since Mary Poppins. I&#39;m definitely watching it on release!
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitaIt so nice.
z4l3-_yub5AdelimeterByIshitanice movie
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaWHAT?!?! NOOOOOOOO!!!!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI liked the song in this but didn&#39;t see anything in the comments about it. Can anyone tell me what it is?
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitajust playing duuude haha, Trey in the movie just means more hot chicks in the  theater lool
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t be mad at Trey for being handsome. Get glad! :D
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI agree, it&#39;s my favorite horror movie after Halloween (1978), not  Rob Zombie&#39;s piece of crap &quot;re-imagining&quot;
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitathe one shot with a potato is the best. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaCnt Wait To See It 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitabut that movie had a sequal... Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, so what is this? I admit I haven&#39;t looked up any information on this movie cause I&#39;m not really that interested given that TCM has a jaded franchise history (TCM 2003- was the best one thus far). If the reviews are good, maybe i&#39;ll go see it but until then, I&#39;m not convinced by this Hollywood big budget trailer... yes big budget given that the first movie looked like it was shot with a potato
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaINTRO SONG NAME????
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitathe black guy always dies where have you been for the last 40 years
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitawhat if he ran out of gas and hes just like well this sucks, Want to go out for some coffee? lmao
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t recall ever being less excited for a movie. Sequel, remake, 3D, or otherwise.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitai love it &lt;3
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitathere will be...
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaOne day there&#39;s going to be a black guy big enough to beat the shit out of the bad guy in these scary movies.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaBut if Trey Songz dies, I don&#39;t want to see it.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaWhen does this come out?????
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaOf course the smartest thing to do while running away from a guy with a chainsaw is... hoping inside of a WOODEN coffin. Genius. . 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaMALISIMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI really like how she&#39;s in a cemetery and there&#39;s an open coffin because you know, there&#39;s open coffins in cemetery&#39;s everywhere you go...
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitagod it&#39;s so hard to be scared when im so turned on by that chick in the trailer 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaCorrect
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIts fucking love drama lol
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaoh no, IT&#39;S HAPPEN AGAIN another stupid idiot terrible movie
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;ll still think it&#39;s a remake after the film comes out just like the ones who still believe it really happened
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaLooks crappy...
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaActually a lot of this film will rock but your first sentence describes the ending to a tee
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThe return of the original Leatherface
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIs it going to be Thomas B.hewitt as an leatherface in the new Texas chainsaw massacre movie
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitatrey songz :)
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitammm tasty!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the real Sawyer Leatherface
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaWho sings that song at the beginning????
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaread the wikipedia page and rethink that statement
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThey did away with the remake series. Returning to the good ole Sawyers
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaWait, so this isn&#39;t a sequel to the 2 others Micheal Bay did?
I&#39;m confused here...
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI agree. The producers and cast have very well stated in the media their intentions to pay ample tribute in a way to satisfy the original&#39;s fanbase. The &#39;74 alumni, precise Quick Hill house recreation, and the real Leatherface character are fine examples of this. This well offsets the 3D, glossy trailer and actors that many people (and me) have complained about. This trailer was just to get the young&#39;uns on board. The next trailer should exemplify true TCM heritage. And it&#39;s Gunnar approved.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s gonna be amazing, however, there is something similar to texas chainsaw 2003 such as the car and the people who are inside it, they are sitting in the same seat
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitareminds me of that one from 2003 and lets face it that was shit too!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThank you...
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaReal Leather
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI have to admit my first watch of this trailer was not very good, i guess i was not in the right mind set, i like how they are trying to follow on from the original and i will look forward to seeing how the stroy continues from the original, hopefully it will work as a sequel unlike the TCM2 that was more of a comady, and i hope this will make lots of TCM fans happy, i think this looks decent, only problem is Trey Songs i mean WUT? hope he dies first, also is this leatherfaces son or something? 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaDan Yeager is going to rip your face off.  Trey Songs SUCKS MY ASS!!!  A guy talking over a drum machine is NOT MUSIC!!!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitai just jizzed my pants
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitavery bad video! :D fuck you!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitalooks pretty amateur and cheap in comparison to the other films , lets hope its still gonna be good.
BTW i liked the part with coffin, it was rather original.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaand games? where are the games?
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI bet the black guy is the only one who survives
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaTC3D features a replica of the original house. You can see my video of this house on my Youtube channel. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshita1:26 how the HELL does her makeup stay on? 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThey are adding onto the remake and the begging. It&#39;s not a remake. It&#39;s the girl from The Begging&#39;s great-granddaughter who just found out about the house.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitanothing. its just an username
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitastill i think cabin in the woods is okay than this.. typical.. AHHH OOOH.. EEEEH...  man, my gf throat is busting.. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI wanna hope they are making good sequel. But... usually when they make new movie after 30-40 years it&#39;s (ALMOST) every time fails.

But let&#39;s hope this doesn&#39;t fail :)
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitafuck you
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s still not a remake
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaDamn. What&#39;s up with all the vulgarity? 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaLast I read, this acts like a prequel or a sequel...or something directly to the original. The Sally girl from the original supposedly makes a cameo in this new movie. :)
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaUm...NO...and it&#39;s ASSWIPE.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshita1974? Glad I still haven&#39;t watched the original. 38yrs and counting....
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaawww my trey songz..
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaMy problem with this being a direct sequel is that the majority of people who are going to see this movie haven&#39;t seen the original (which isn&#39;t tht big a deal to me just saying) but also wouldn&#39;t leather face be old as shit or even dead at this point. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s NOT a fucking remake! It&#39;s a direct sequel to the original. Get your facts right before talking shit!!!!!!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a direct sequel to the original.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaSeriously mad movies are being reamde in 3d..There even doing a fkin nemo 3d now!!like wtf!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaTgeres always one black guy in teenage scary movies..these days
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI bet trey songz is the first &amp; the worst death just cus he&#39;s the only black person in this movie U_U
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaUntill they put Michael Myers, LeathFace, Jason etc etc all in the same movie, slasher films will never make that much money
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaYUUUUP
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaTHE BLACK GUY DIES FIRST... AKA TREY SONGS
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaSmh
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaTREY SONGZZZZZZZZ&lt;3
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaWhy would you ask me that? Thats pretty weird bro.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshita....???? Nooooo......
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaYou dont have to do that &quot;@&quot; thing you know i know your talking to me.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaCalm down, I was making a joke. I&#39;m not judging it at all. I do want to see this.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaJust see the fucking trailer and stop judge every thing you see,not everything is perfect you know.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaBecause they want to give the original TCM, a sequel it deserved
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThe first remake of this wasn&#39;t scary.  Now when I saw the original...That scared me!  And the original isn&#39;t extremely bloody or anything.  It was just genuinely scary and well made.  

The trailer seems to make this look kinda scary, but I guess we&#39;ll just see about that.  Nothing can top the original, though.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a remake its a direct sequel to the 74 film.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaNot a remake, direct sequel to 74 film.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThis one is more closer to the 74 film, Its even set in the same feel as TCM was.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshita1:51

interesting. What kind of an idiot would kill someone with a chainsaw in front of 100 people at a fair. He&#39;s bound to get caught. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitathis is going to suck like all the other remakes of the original, i&#39;m 95% sure. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaOh, well I hope it well be good. 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaSequel.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThis is not a remake this is a direct sequel to the 74 film.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaTrey Songz ! :D
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s okay. The original Halloween (yes, 1978 original) will be re-released on the big screen this October. 

30 &quot;odd&quot; years and a film from the 70&#39;s is going to be more frightening than the predictable crap we are given nowadays.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t have high hopes for this one. But it should be better than the 2003 remake
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaSweet!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaYou have summarised the majority of horror films in the last 15 or so years, and you are 100% correct!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaUgh, this looks too polished to be a TCM film, it looks just like that awful Friday the 13th remake.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s see. College/High School kids with two hot (supposedly) girls, two guys and then the third wheel guy(Usually black(I apologize if I offend anyone about the last statement.)). Road trip. Abandoned house with a scary story behind it. I&#39;m PRETTY sure this is a horror...I think.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThis looks absolutely DREADFUL! 
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaThe one thing I hate about a horror movie is when they make stupid remakes, Halloween remake was BAD! The remake of halloween 2 just BAD! There are some remakes that are good, but some that just SUCK! I don&#39;t really hate remakes, it&#39;s just old horror movies like friday the 13th and halloween had STUPID spin offs that just SUCK!!!!!!. I just hope they don&#39;t fuck up for this one, but only time will tell if this film is a good remake. But if they keep make 3D remakes, I will go fucking crazy.
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaDezzzz nutzzzz IN 3D !!!
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaNo.. Just no..
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitaCould have done something interesting with continuing from the first Tobe Hooper film erasing the 2nd film from memory, but this just looks like the same shit we&#39;ve seen.  The first re-make sucked because it was way over produced.  This one&#39;s gonna suck because it doesn&#39;t have anything new to bring to the table.  
gB0aHrd7rUodelimeterByIshitai&#39;m going to watch this when it comes out

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaDisgusting combination American Pie with fantasy. Very very low humor for dumb fat teens... Who spend money for this??
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@corthisisgay For the green band (appropriate audiences) trailer a shot of Natalie Portman&#39;s back (that was also used unaltered in the red band trailer) was digitally altered to turn a thong into a more substantial and less revealing garment.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaZooey is hotter.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitawhen does it come out

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaAnd not a single smile was given
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitao shit natlie portman is hot as hell
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitapress 1 then 4, he&#39;s the one going to have a funny face
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitahow come shes wearing ordanery knicers when in the other add she baths in a thong???
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@TheJACKALO  Gotta love that,lol
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@jazbatee Natalie Portman is beautiful! I&#39;m a girl... even I WOULD. 
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@TheRedHeadband dropkick murphy..the warriors code
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaomg what a stinker ..... maybe if you&#39;re 11 this is funny, but not so much even then. terrible as a description that comes to mind, all the funniest parts and i do mean the trailer is the best part, are shown here, save your cash and stare at a sidewalk for awhile, its cheaper and funnier. ......
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaJUST WENT AND SAW THIS, BEST MOVIE EVER. SOOOOOOOOO FUNNY, really gory and nudity and etc. dunno how its rated 14A but im thankful. xD
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaAVATAR ROKU.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaif everyones going to be disappointed with every single effing movie that comes out, then okay. but most movies aren&#39;t even made to even try and be Oscar-material, there just there to give you a cheap laugh and there not there to be extremely thought provoking. 

just lay off.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitahows the movie

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this movie! looks like its gonna be the most awesome weed movie so far... haah
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t understand why people are bagging on the movie so much. its a comedy and the actors and actresses do comedies, especially like these ones because they don&#39;t have to be stuck up and perfect in their roles. its care free and fun. if you don&#39;t like this type of movie don&#39;t say that this one is bad. 
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@nothingness36 @nothingness36 He is getting a PhD and is planning on going into academia. This is his &quot;hobby&quot; that pays well. He is gonna take fun roles.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the girl from Torchwood! 
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitahahahaha looks absolutely terrible
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaDun care about Natalie whats-her-face, I adore Zooey tho she is just adorable :3
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THAT SONG?
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita&quot;You got to suck out the venom!
I don&#39;t want to suck it you suck it!
I can&#39;t reach it with my mouth!
Courtney suck the venom!
I never sucked-
SUCK IT!&quot;

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaNever triangle face!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE Natalie Portman!!!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitathe guy from the golden child!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@pirategirlkc It is the only logical answer for her to be in this movie.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaDid Natalie lose a bet?
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaDid Natalie Portman lose a bet?
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaomg that look soooo funny!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita...what...the hell was that?
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaZooey? AND Natalie? this is too much for me.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@figliodicane   hot and smart, Harvard educated.  The Professional was a good movie too.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@Tynissa92 

Pretty good cast and effects for 50 cents.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@GlaciusNLV $0.50
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaWonder what the budget for this flim was.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitalol, why do people always use the word FUCK
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@DLenehan33 
who the fuck do you think you are? and i&#39;m sure you could do better hmm? haha you wish. fuck off bro.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@jazbatee she has always been hot. ever since The Professional.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitathis movie would be better if they didn&#39;t put on accents
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaCorny!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that La Flama Blanca is in this makes up for the map from the middle ages containing South America
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaIt looks reminiscent of Willow, I will enjoy this movie.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitai am rich i live in a castle and i can do magic EPIC!!!!!:P
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaWarriors Code by Dropkick Murphys is de song for anyone who&#39;s wondering! quality song and looks like a quality movie!

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitahaha, i love that two of the leads are nominated for incredibly serious roles and turn around to produce this comedy fest!  brilliant!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita&quot;Why would anyone be with you?&quot; - &quot;I&#39;m not sure, really. Oh yeah, perhaps because I&#39;m rich, I live in a castle and I can do magic.&quot;

the way he says that is absolutely brilliant
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@jazbatee Name a movie or for that matter, name anything you&#39;ve seen Natalie in that she didn&#39;t look hot?!
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@scorpionkings that does not matter for me
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaNatalie is pregnant and engaged! That sucks.

1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaHilarious! To be honest though, this trailer is better than the red band trailer.
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshitaI love Natalie Portman&#39;s new direction. This awesome movie and starring in a stoner flick she&#39;s producing. Very nice
1nB2pWEW9ywdelimeterByIshita@rabbit54 that&#39;s what I though, hopefully James Franco doesn&#39;t end up like Heath Ledger though

JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI am absolutely THRILLED there is a second one coming out and the best part of this is they are the original cast!!!  Smart move on their part!  I will probably see this 5 times at the movies before it even goes on DVD!  YAY!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaIn case anyone was wondering, &quot;poulaki&quot; means &quot;little bird&quot;.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaOOOh i cant wait

JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitawhat is the first song?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYAAAAY! Can&#39;t wait for it. The trailer had me in fits. 
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy right now I just really freaked out a ran around the house freaking out this is the best movie ever you can believe I will be watching this
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThank god my parents arent like this! xD
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThis is a generic-2005 teenager, not a generic-2015 teenager. C&#39;mon man, we&#39;ve changed in 10 years.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m probably the only 18 year old black guy that is super excited for this but when your a young kid with nothing but a VHS player and live across the street from a thrift shop you pick up some things
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitano windex?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitai liked the first one, this one shows they couldn&#39;t find another story. imo
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaHAAAA i can&#39;t wait!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitasaw this trailer as an ad, cant wait to see it now, looks just as funny as the original lol :3
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe it took them 13 years to make part 2 lol
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI love the first movie cause it was a like a horror movie for me. Growing up in a greek family.... is exactly like this.But... less funny! The part in the first movie where Gus is saying, &quot;Is he a good boy, I don&#39;t know? Does he come from a good family, I don&#39;t know?&quot; My father said those exact same thing when my Sister got married and got mad the same way! lol
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh the cast still looks the same! I guess you can say if you&#39;re Greek you don&#39;t age a week? Kinda like Black don&#39;t crack.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaOMG I JUST FELT NOSTLAGIC AND SEARCHED UP THE FIRST ONE.<br>I never thought I would find a second movie in the making<br><br>so going to see this!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaAunt Voula<br> makes me crack up every time! It has been too long and I am so ready for this sequel!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaif your knees are open shut your eyes  omg i died hahah

JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s official, we are out of movie ideas...
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaFinally, a sequel that looks almost as good as the first movie. CAN&#39;T WAIT!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI heard they took a loan from the IMF to make this movie-

Thx Mr. Hanks for bringing this marvelous continuation.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshita&#39;My family follows me everywhere&#39;   yep  even at volleyball   LOL
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYes, Yes, Yes!!  So excited....can&#39;t wait!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI DONT THINK I HAVE EVER BEEN THIS EXCITED IN MY LIFE
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaeyes open knees shot,  but if your knees are open shoot your eyes. hahahahaha Nia you got yourself another #1 box office hit.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI never thought there would a part 2 but I&#39;m so happy that there is, cant wait to see it.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitayou find greek boy and make babies. lol i just died, still don&#39;t get bored of the first one
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThis move is coming out on the same day as Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, who takes the box office in this?!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitawhen i first heard about this concept, i rolled my eyes at the thought of another reboot, but this trailer? gives me hope.<br><br>i don&#39;t even like the first movie all that much, but for those that do, i think they&#39;re getting a decent sequel.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaIf I could &quot;Like&quot; this trailer a billion times, I would!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaIts about time!!!! 🙌
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad all the original cast are back!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThe day has finally come!!!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaTIMEFLIES ANYONE?!?!?!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitai think this is the first time I have actually been excited about a movie like this &lt;3
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t hardly wait!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t funny the first go around. And it&#39;s gonna be god-awful the second time at bat.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m fangirling too much.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitammmm , nop
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaoh wow does this look bad
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaAs an American of Greek descent ..... perfect!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI am a huge fan of the first movie. One of the things I loved about it was its honest humor. I&#39;m looking forward to the new one! It seems to be turning out really well, but I hope it&#39;s the last BFGW movie. This doesn&#39;t need to turn into a franchise, because I feel like if they start doing a ton of these they will lose their value.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitahahahaha, cant wait!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaLOVEEEEE IT YASSSSSSS
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitawait if my math is right the original movie came out in 2002, their daughter would still be 13 or 14 so she would either be an 8th or 9th grader, so why is she looking at applying to colleges so soon?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaMy mom and I can&#39;t get enough of the first film! We quote it daily and seeing that there is a second one coming out just made my life. Love Nia! I already know I&#39;m going to love this
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitalove love love #1 and can&#39;t wait for this --- <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a hippie!&quot;
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like it&#39;s trying to be 2 different stories.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitayeesssssss!!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaLooks to be full of hilarity.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI wish the daughter looked more Greek :/
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaOh my God! I want to see this!!!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Protect your poulaki&quot; LOL
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaPayback! Love it
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThe first My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of the VERY few &quot;chick flicks&quot; I actually love.  Maybe because it&#39;s more of a comedy with relatable characters, instead of just dumb or hackneyed ones.  I can&#39;t wait to see this with my sister!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this!  The first one was amazing and considering Nia wrote both, I&#39;m eagerly anticipating all of this!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve grown up watching this movie and it&#39;s brought me such joy for years and the fact that I&#39;m now 17 and soon gong to be able to really enjoy this with my mother in theaters makes me so HAPPY! Thank you Universal for letting there be a #2! I CANT WAIT!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThe first one was the great underdog movie of all time.  The critics hated it, but it just kept making money week after week, for months with no marketing.  It made 200 million profit, a lot of it going to Tom Hanks.  This trailer is actually better than the first movie&#39;s trailer.  Might be another big fat Check for Hanks.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the name of the song in the background?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaOMG I can&#39;t wait to see this!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the last song in the trailer?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!! I knew there would be a sequel !!! Gus and Toula are my favorite characters!!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Why do you want to leave me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Payback...&quot;<br><br>LOL! 😆
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Greek and I endorse this message
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaNever seen the first one. Well i know what i will be doing this weekend
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaNah it&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s not for a sequel
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYes!!! Can&#39;t wait!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshita&quot;PULL MY NECK!&quot;
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaThat was...actually good. Nice job Nia! You might have caught lightning in a bottle twice.
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitapull my neck!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaBut why?
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaSO excited!!! I adored the first one and this one looks like it&#39;s going to be just as fabulous!! YAY!!! &lt;3
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like plastic surgery
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYay!!! :) I loved, loved, loved the first one!  I can&#39;t wait for this one! :)
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaYES!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaI quite liked the first one. This one also looks good.. it better be good. The best part is this doesn&#39;t look forced!
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaLooks nice
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitalol
JQ-1Ts3BChMdelimeterByIshitaLol😈

NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaHi everyone I&#39;m Olivia Linda and am here to share the wonderful testimony for the good work Dr vera segi did for me. After 5 years in marriage with my lover with 2 kids, my lover started acting weird and going out with other ladies and showed me cold love, on several occasions he threatens to divorce me if I dare question him about his affair with other ladies, I was totally devastated and confused until a old friend of mine told me about a spell caster called Dr vera segi who help people with relationship and marriage problem and also herbs for cure of any sickness or diseases by the powers of love spells, at first I doubted if such thing ever exists but decided to give it a try, when I contact him, he helped me cast a love spell and within 11hours my lover came back to me and started apologizing, now he has stopped going out with other ladies and his with me for good and for real. Contact this great love spell caster for your relationship or marriage problem to be solved today Whats-app him: +2348051759674 OR Email via: verasegispells@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>

NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaI love the movie it&#39;s awesome
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaSmartness is important in marriage and in a relationship and I’m glad that cyberhackinggenius helped cloned my husband’s phone. I got access to all his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his phone. All I did was share my husband’s phone number with Cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone without having to touch his phone. My husband was a cheating Narcissist and I’m glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I’m here in UK and able to access my husband’s phone messages with a link on my phone even while he was away in Canada cheating on me. I got to discover that my husband who is legally married to me here in UK is also recently married to another woman in Canada and I’m finally going through a divorce with lots of evidence against him. I read all deleted and recent chats on his Whatsapp, Twitter,Facebook,Instagram messages and Skype. You can contact this great Hacker Gavin via Gmail  (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and I hope you find peace of mind after finding the truth just like myself!

NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaDoes it bother anyone else when the guy says, &quot;I know I&#39;m not good enough for you, but I&#39;ll spend the rest of my life proving that I am.&quot; It doesnt make sense.

NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaI kept thinking this was a joke, the trailer is so cheesy and cliched. 
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitawhy is my heart breaking.
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaforever alone.
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshita&quot;She was a girl more interested in books than the real world.&quot; FINALLY, someone understands us!!
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaNicholas Sparks&#39;s &quot;The Notebook&quot; much?
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaLol why the dad
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song in the trailer? I like it.

NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaAfter😏
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaI see they change the trailer to make it look like was supposed to be now.good for them.
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitawhen I saw the trailer in the theater I thought it was a horror movie the way it started. It has a really bad trailer that makes it sound like and look like a horror movie.then it turns out to be some kinda romantic movie/drama, nope not seeing it. 
NTAzn4W48gcdelimeterByIshitaAlex Pettyfer is perfrect &lt;3 i love him my mom saw the 1983 verison of the Movie and she had me watch and it was a good Movie. i cant wait to see this Verison of the movie because they Cast Alex to Play David &lt;3
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThe first one was good, the rest just repeated the same thing over and over again.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pretty sure the girl gets screwed in the balance beam, thumbs up
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@Kipperphx lol yea me too!, great game BTW! =]
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitafwwooaah the last part with the needles is just....AAHH FTW!!  

and dont dislike the movie because of rallisP (hes a jerk)
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaSomething new... I do hope this is really something new.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita-_- Really? Like really? If they were going to make a 5th one, they should have at least decided while making the 4th one to not call it &quot;The Final Destination.&quot; I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a good movie, but wtf?
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaNothing can be worse than the 4th movie so I&#39;ll give this one a chance, there are alot of familiar faces in this so hopefully they will not disapoint
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaEnough already. These movies depress me.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita:20

Probably the first time I&#39;ve been able to tell a movie will be terrible simply from the way an actress looks.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitawasnt the last one supposed to be the FINAL destination?? fuck
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitahahah this is a joke right ?!
this isn&#39;t scary at all !!!
It&#39;s funny as hell tho xD
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaShit! Now i scared of everything..
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaSo that black guy is supposed to be the grim reaper or something? 0_0 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaWTF? What the hell with 69 peoples? -.-
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaOh Man!, I was going to a laser surgery before -i saw this damn video.

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita1:11 the black dude lol...someone in the film must of looked in the mirror at midnight and said candyman three times
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThe end Just Like A 1000 Ways To Die 
lol
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitashould b entertaining...not sure if in a good or bad way thou..
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@SmexyAsianGirls That&#39;s true but when compared to the deaths from the first film, these are nothing
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@Darconda90 He had Acupuncture needles in him man. He feel over on the acupuncture needles. That would probably really hurt or possibly kill him. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaI love how intense the guys face is when he realizes there is a NAIL on the gymnastic equipment. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThe fuck was the last death about? He just fell over, now I see why people say Hollywood is running out of ideas
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaOMG, is that Hillary Duff?
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitapeople here who are complaining and trashtalking the movie, c&#39;mon, you know you&#39;re gonna watch it despite your negative comments on it. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@Tlobbbood Cuz Its Shot In 3D. Look At Final Destination 4 &amp; Piranha 3D. Looks Bad But In 3D, Its Good

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaYay... we can watch stupid, careless people kill people again... :D
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaToo far.

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitai feel like they are just taking stuff from 1000 Ways to Die now.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@Cheesenets which is a good thing.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaHot tare ?...well it was funny !!! lol 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitawhat a poor CG
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitabs.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitawhats with the fucking dislikes...trailer is awesome imo
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@fupets Final Destination 4 made a lot of money, so a fifth movie was green-lighted.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitahey whats candyman doing there?
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitathey said Final Destination 4 was the last of final destination series?
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks better than &quot;The&quot; Final Destination. And they returned to numbering the series!
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@FUNNYMAN8888 u forgot to put ur sunglasses on
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaAt the end, i put most of you&#39;s were like &quot;ouch&quot;
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer shows us how a bunch of the characters die. Why would we want to see it? Talk about spoilers. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaWow, they are just taking death from 1000 ways to die. But at least they are putting a number in the title!
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this!
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitastupid movie.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitalove this crap
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitalol there are five &#39;final&#39; destinations
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaBecause of this movie.. I watch my every close move of a single flaw in the room.....

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaCome on... there are more creative ways to kill people.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitalol
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitai will wait it with hd, like always
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitajust stop it already.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaIt doesn&#39;t seem like they are trying as hard with the newer ones.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaoh my god i had a vision.......we cant go see this movie its gonna blow!!! PLEASE DONT GO

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitatHEY TOOK AWAY THE ONE GOOD THING ABOUT FINAL DESTINATION IT BEING FUN
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaOh shit nobody drive on a bridge now....wtf
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita#1 was the only good one but this looks like it can be good
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaacupunture? eye surgery? now this is just ridiculus, another great movie series ruined, just like saw
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitawatched part 4 too....guess i will have that health i had it to watch this again....:))
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitai think this gonna be good movie. Final destination only has two directors and this is the Good director. Number 2 and 4 were freaking terrible. 1 and 3 were great. guess whose directing 5? the same guy who directs 1 and 3. so it will be great!!!! :D
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaas stupid as these movies are i cant stop watching them.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitafor a movie about death, it sure doesnt wanna die. :P
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;Alfred cancel my laser eye surgery and my chinese needle therapy appointment &#39;&#39;
guess who am i ?

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitai just rather watch saw ...
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaLOL
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitathey just need to cast these movies with all fantastic looking girl casts and have them die in sexual related deaths. the only way these will stay entertaining : )
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitathat guy looks like Tom Cruise
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitacandyman
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitawhat doctor would leave a patient with her eye forced open fucking stupid the bridge scene looks cool though 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaWhats the definition of &quot;Final&#39; again?  5 films! First one was the best. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaThanks alot, CandyMan.

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaNew line cinema sure knows how to keep a piece of shit smelling like it was just made this morning.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaMr.Poop

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaLove IT...
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshita@ChurchOfMe93 haha I love that joke I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad. Its true. My initial reaction to seeing this in my subscription was &quot;o damn not another one&quot;
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitahAHAHAHHAHAHAHA OMG I laughed my ass off when he fell off the table!!!
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaSO EXCITED! This one looks different from the rest of the franchise, the aura feels different too :) can&#39;t wait!  The whole &quot;kill or be killed&quot; theme is definitely intriguing
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitathe last one made me laugh... 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaAt least it has Tony Todd. Not sure if that counts for anything, but it&#39;s a good start.
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaBTW I WANT TO PLAY A GAME ! hahahhaa it will follow the same fate as the SAW franchise it will have like a billion sequels
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaDavid Koechner in a Final Destination....That&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna say and that&#39;s all I should say.

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaWhen you see one of them, you&#39;ve them all...

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitathe only scary thing was candyman 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaCan we stop with these stupid ass fucking final destination movies. 
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaCandyman is DEATH!!!
g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitahere come rallis p fans

g7V84i92H4AdelimeterByIshitaOMG TONY TODD IS BACK

-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaLoved this movie so much. Rewatched it so many times especially the sequels. This is how you make a female lead movie without forcing women power and all those feminist BS.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a big avid fan of this movie from the last part. New friend here and subscriber. Watching from Davao De Oro, Philippines. 🇵🇭

-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitathe best part of underworld movies
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaThe Underworld series is basically a supernatural version of Romeo &amp; Juliet :)
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@DoYouFearDeath333 first song is marilyn manson, Disassoative
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@GeeeRiff i went to the cinema for the first one well, i expect a horror movie with vampires so i got that, my father said the same thing, it&#39;s like the movie is having fun with the audience (vampire shines in the light)
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaVictor is the glorious vampiric elder...he deserves the respect of all...even the hound slaves of hell!  He was the god of this world...he was the all powerful ruling dictator of the creatures of the night...and he was betrayed by his daughter for such a union!  The defiled goddess deserved her fate, for it was her redemption unto a more horrific world. 
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@SCIDJAdvertising I agree, the creatures of the night are a curse as much as a gift, they would not be able to resist the demand for blood, it&#39;s like a constant starvation, if food is around, and your starving...you will indulge, it is inevitable...and such dark evils would have to deal with the consequences of their undeniable power.  Strength is counteracted with the inability to walk amongst the dwellers of the day, and the immortal thirst removes the color and animated taste of our meals.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@Huscarlavery Same with werewolves! Honestly girls do you really expect werewolf to want to protect you! Their bloodthirsty beasts that will kill anything that moves including you girls.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@JacobWolfPack5  hmm// thanks for the info =)
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@Grievous1997 Lol yeah, that&#39;s weird. Underworld ftw!
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitawhat is the connection of this second part from the first part? please answer me guys! thanks! =)
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaUnderworld is my favorite vampire series...it kicks ass!...i am a girl nd straight..but i Kate Beckinsale makes a hot vampire in all the movies lol...luv the movies &lt;3
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s odd that Michael Sheen has been in both the best and the worst Vampire movies.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaDont you never dare to compare this with twilight! NEVAH! ILL KILL YA ALL!!!
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitai like twilight, but when you compare it to this, it&#39;s like a vampire movie for kids! its like a kids movie! seriously, if jacob faced these werewolves he will be killed only in a sec!
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitawe can be slave? or we can be LYCANS !!! 
COOL
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@Huscarlavery You forgot to mention that &#39;werewolves&#39; is big but normal wolves, who protect humans from vampires. 
BULLSHIT.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaGood
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaUnderworld shits on Twilight a hundred times over!!
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitai love &lt; 3
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@elasolezito your comment was 10 months ago and this movie now pisses AND shits in twilight&#39;s face :)
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@JustMoveWithTheFloW I know! When I hear that line my skin crawls, the rage, the vengeance in his eyes. So perfect.
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaMarylin Manson if i was your vampire!
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know where to get the trailer music for this without the cast talking??
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitaUnderworld kicks ass
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshita@elasolezito more like eats and shits twilight out......
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitathis movie takes a piss in twilight&#39;s face !
-dUgVLvYSe4delimeterByIshitathey made it now
but it&#39;s about how lycan en sonja became in love and fought and... well you know 
died ^^

7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened to the guy who survived and got revenge on his captor,s in part 1?
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitathe Saw movies were less depraved than this. I got sick watching this movies.
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaNot as intense as hostel 1 and 3. There&#39;s some element of a horror comedy that can reduce that edge of your seat tension. Unlike in more serious and intense movies. And i find some inconsistencies in the storyline that raises questions of WHY And HOW.

7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaA film made by a mentally retarded person, with some mentally retarded people, for the retarded,only.
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitatrash movie, 0 gore everytime something happens, some one getting in the way, pure trash, the movie had 1 single gore scene with the dick, nothing more. worst movie ever.
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaPart 1 is the best but this one isn&#39;t that bad. It has some weird editing though lol
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaby far the best hostel movie
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaThat voice ruins it lol
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaHOSTEL PART 1 is the best
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaDamn scary
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaScared
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshita日本語が聞こえてきてびっくりした
7oG7ktw806YdelimeterByIshitaShiiiit! Eli Roth is like a text book example of a guy who managed to make a decent and quite a successful 1st film, and then, after he had to decide what to do afterwards, he came up with the easiest solution, to make a sequel of his first success! And pay attention to this - he says his goal was to make a better second part! So what he did do? An utter shit, that can only be described as a Z-class  horror movie, made by some total idiots, who can&#39;t come up with a single good idea, let alone with something a bit better - to say the least!<br>I mean,  there&#39;s not a fucking thing in this part that&#39;s at least decent, let alone good, or eve watchable! Nothing make sense to anyone with at least brains, let alone to start analyzing this crap! Luckily for him, this world, especially the world of horror fans, IS FULL WITH IDIOTS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE IQ OF AROUND 80,  so they can&#39;t tell a difference! <br>However, there are those of us who know what a good film is, therefore, we&#39;re especially sensitive about IDIOTISMS in the world of horrors! So we feel like someone has served us a plate of shit with this one, and especially, after we saw his last crap, that turns out to be nothing less idiotic than THIS SHIT his remake of the legendary :Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, and we see that the guy had hit an accidental homerun with the 1st Hostel, so we won&#39;t stop shitting about this sacrilege he&#39;d done (although, it beats the hell out of me, how the real director of &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, Rugero Daudato, could&#39;ve sit quiet and take that massacre of his masterpiece with a smile on his face!<br>Thus, there could be only 2 explanations! Either the ages are doing their thing - the guy&#39;s in a Potato Land, or he took a lot of money - most likely both! <br>Anyways, Eli Roth is a guy who accidentally made one good film with Hostel, and then went back on his usual track, that should be obvious what it is, to all those who know a thing or two about film, that it was a pure accident he had that success with &quot;Hostel&quot;, as he has skills of making another good horror, as much as a donkey can make you a good dinner!

SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita1:40 is either Jill Valentine or Claire!
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyy wont they end this tragedy
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWatch Albert Wesker steal the show. We finally get to see him in action in the film series.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@MadHatter8D  What ? Unless you are dumb and cant understand the meaning of my comments, you would not start name-calling.

The point is all RE movies sucked and got bad reviews from everyone so why make another one ?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitais that ablert wesker?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitafuck this looks like shit, i don&#39;t know why I am surprised though... 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaI TOTALLY love this song! It&#39;s a Remix of A Perfect Circle&#39;s &quot;The Outsider&quot;. The whole Album is a KILLER (Thirteenth Step from 2003). One of my all time favourites. &lt;3
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaSome parts look cheesy
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaThey already ruined the 1st 3 RE movies by putting one-dimensional actors in it and having a female hero instead of male one.
This movie will be a disaster just like Salt.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitao ya cause the last resident evil movies have done SOOOO well....lets make another
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWentworth Miller should work out for the movie, if you see in Resident Evil 5 the game, Chris is huge, just saying
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaYAY!! ANOTHER RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE!! CAN&#39;T WAIT TO WATCH THIS!! x]
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@robhartjr123 Honestly, when a movie tries to mimic a game, it always suck (RE2 :/) When it doesnt, it comes out a lot better RE1/3(i like 3 regardless of what everyone says).

They can keep the idea, but twist it should stand on its own baring. 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@kimmendazer Dead. Seriously, he died in RE Apocalypse. 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaI like those heels =D
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaman..where&#39;s leon?!
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song at the end of the trailer. please reply! :P
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@grewt1234 Yeah, the second film lacked in depth of a story. Like you say, it was just trying to mimic RE3.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaLooks better then that facebook movie thou
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitasad to see that the horror game that terrorised my childhood became a cheezy action movie

n wesker din die 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@sneekee63797 He is dead in the movies
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@ph33rbenkthankslol A Perfect Circle - The Outsider (Apocalypse Remix)
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at the end
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitajust looks like the matrix and serenity with zombies in it
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaEvery RE movie just keeps getting better...and I think this one is going to continue the trend. I&#39;M SO EFFIN&#39; EXCITED!!! And it comes out on my birthday too! AWESOME!
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitadoes any one know the name of the song from 1:28 to 1:45
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitawow by the looks of it   it&#39;s a mix of resident evil 2 (movie) and the resident evil 5 (game) becuse it looks like the people are carrying weapons and there arms are mostly black shades (not racest) if you agree thumbps up plz
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaAre those clones at 1:57?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@smashtasm6IsBack

SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitai wudn&#39;t really say they missed the like button...it looks pretty cheesy considering the recent resident evil movies... love the game tho... just not these movies...
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaSO WHAT RESIDENT EVIL VIDEO GAME IS RESIDENT EVIL AFTERLIFE A SPIN OFF OF? 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaprison break 5 - resident evil
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitai wish they had leon
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@siraj10 it was Jackspicer2311 :D
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 Extiction took place 5 years after the apocalypse so I guess Jill were already with Chris while Carlos and L.J meet Claire and sticked with her.I guess the girl got killed or died cause I don&#39;t remember if they mentioned her. Carlos were already romantically involved with Alice in the Alice novels and as we could see a bit in extinction too(in one of the deleted scenes they even hold hands). Nice talking with you btw. :)
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@PhoenixShadow000 Ah cool! :) Thanks for the info! They might mention her at some point by chris maybe talking about her so the others know they worked together already. At least I hope they will connect it this way so the story of the games can connect to the movies well. Crystal is the new character they added in the movie since Sienna(Jill) wasn&#39;t available. I think that the happenings of the movie take place before RE5 so Sheva didn&#39;t meet Chris yet. The trailer already makes me want more :)
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 BTW: Jill would had been included in the fourth movie again but Sienna wasn&#39;t free for the role once again. :( So they left the character out in the hope to included in a new movie in the future. She would had also more martial arts moves in the second movie but the outfit from the third game she had on prevented her from doing so. That&#39;s why they limited her moves to punches and gunfights only.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 Jills story were continued in the game RE5 by showing us in the &quot;lost nightmares&quot; that she went against wesker together with Chris. After what happened Wesker planted the device we saw in RE5 on her. The same device he also planted on Claire(in the movie). Chris &amp; Sheva saved Jill and Jill and Joss fought themselves out of there while Chris went against wesker with Sheva(Jill takes part in it at the end as far as I remember too). :) The third movie introduced the clones of Alice.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWhile there ARE a FEW exceptions, generally, sequels suck.  To date on this franchise, the first is the best.  Still, looking forward to zombies in 3D.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this! I&#39;ve always liked the films, though not as much as the games I&#39;ll admit. The fact that the films are so different from the game franchise is no excuse to immediately dismiss them though, in my opinion. You&#39;ve just got to look at them separately. This film looks to be the best in the series though I think, and even those who hated the past films will hopefully enjoy this one.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 Well in the third movie they showed that the virus had spread outside the world anyway due to the experiments that were taking place outside of racoon. They also introduced wesker and ended the story of the doctor that made the modifications on alice and nemesis as also the story of carlos and the black guy. For that they introduced claire and created a continuety they could pick up for the 4th movie. Too bad wesker still found her and put a device on her like he did with Jill in RE5.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 I think you missunderstood me. ^_^ What I meant was to add them in a faschion that connects to the games story like they did with jill, carlos, nikolai and others before. As example, in the second movie we have parts of the third game, in the first movie they connect the first two games with the difference that Alice is in the core while the game characters that we don&#39;t see in the game are at the villa and city at the same time. Chris appears in the RE5 faschion. :)
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@bekjanov1 I think the approach they took by having a other main character for the movies than for the games gave them more space and flexibility. That&#39;s also why the movies are successfull. I too know all the games and like the series so I was skeptical at first when I saw the first movie. However, after I saw that they connected the games story with the movie one in parts that made sense I was ok with it. It would be boring to repeat the game anyway cause we would know everything that happens.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitayes he is
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@antman60854  the outsider by a perfect circle
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitai hope chris redfield is in this movie
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@repzard99 The 4th movies should be over 2 hours big according to rumours! :)
I also think that they needed more time so they can connect the RE5 story with the movie story properly so Chris and Weskers appearances make sense.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@bekjanov1 They actually showed the creation of nemesis and alice from the end of the first movie till the end of the second one. The third was based after the happenings and the end of raccoon city to show us what happened to some of the survivors (Carlos, Claire and the Black guy I forgot its name). In the third movie they showed how claire with a few others flees to alaska in the 4th they connect the RE5 game with the movie story so chris and wesker can appear. Can&#39;t wait! :)
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song at the end?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitawhere the fuck is Leon?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@curzon17 the first one was really good tho
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitai know im gonna love this movie i dont care if it dosent have to do with anything with the games it looks awesome
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@gantzero7 jajajaja 
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaat the end, that&#39;s a perfect circle song right?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they keep making crappy movies based on fabulous games???
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@HolyWasteland I&#39;m just saying, it would complete the cast
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitastupid movie, it&#39;s matrix with zombies
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWHAT AN EPIC AXEHAMMER THIS HUGE BEAST HAS !!! SEPTEMBER IS SO FAR!

SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaiiZ This Film Gna Be An 18?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@alfa8 Dude there&#39;s two trailers and none have aired on tv (where I&#39;m from) how exactly is it being over hyped
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitalooks lame like all the other RE movies
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@hahaimhenry who is thomas shin?
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaWhere did this trailer come out in? I didn&#39;t see this on apple trailers, not in a movie theater, i didn&#39;t check imdb, but seriously, whenever a big movie like this has a new trailer out I AM SUPPOSE TO KNOW ABOUT IT. HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS? WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON HERE? GOSH DAMN IT!!!
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaI like this movie so much! =) the resident evil!
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@alfa8 I definitely don&#39;t think  it will backfire. It&#39;s got a solid cult fanbase, and that, along with the extra cash from the 3-D will make it a moderate success. My prediction.
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@nhavy1 oh yeah, its the outsider
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshita@lena889889 i think its gravity im sure is a perfect circle
SRRN6MvCdegdelimeterByIshitaAlice vs Wesker??... interesting

Robert Hoffman is hott. (;
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the dance move at :41?
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the beat at 0:22
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitawht are the songs used in this trailer?
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitareally? did they absolutly have to make another movie about college students learning about life thru dance. how original..the first 90 times they made this is just sad
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaBrian Evigan is so hot
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so horrible...
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitashe just did that for dramatic effect
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaI Think Step Up is better than this one; but i&#39;ll have to wait untill is see step up 2 ;]
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshita369 by Cupid
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitathe dancing is good and all but the movie is soo stereotypical. theyre gonna start off rough, theres gonna be some bad person then in the end they overcome some major challenge to win the competition. Yawn.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitahun you didn&#39;t finish your sentence... &quot;if you think this osnt (isn&#39;t) good stuff....&quot; I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a fabulous movie, but this type of story line has been done before.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s worse..
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitai think its just a cameo he does. he&#39;s not gonna be in the movie that much. This movie is a different storyline with two different leads.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaso does channing actually play a big role in this?
or is it going to be like he pops up for moral support..
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaoh my god... this story is just like that hideous yet classic 80s movie Breakin!!! where oh where has all the originality gone?!?!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaWell I for one agree with you :-)
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!
robert hoffman &lt;33 :D
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitathat music is shit antifunky newskool shit
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitajeebus. so they just use the white folks this time around...
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaROBERT HOFFMAN kdjfkldjafkljdaflk. :]]]
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitapart 1 was weak, part 2 is even weaker!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitapart 1 was weak...part 2 is gonna be weaker!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitafuckin channing tatum omggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!! he my man dat lil drop it like its hot thing at da end of one of his move was sexxiiiiiiiiiiiiii wooooooooo he is so fuckable nun bad better happen to him in da movie
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaCHURCH
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaIt seems good.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitai really dont like richard heffman
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitastep up 1 i think is much better
but well see when this movie comes out
but the characters were better
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaOmg, I love the song that starts playing at like 2:11 or something, can anyone please tell me what this is?
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaThat girl is so sexy
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitalmao u got served and step up 1 combined!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitahahaaa a strong story?!?! step up 1 was the most predictable movie ever made!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaoooomiugooosh cant wait.....nuthin can beat step up 1. lol! mmmm..... channing tatum!! hehe.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaits by t-pain.
its called &quot;church&quot;
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaYour a fool if you think dance has no color. Why I do agree it is a form of expressing a message. Who message are they expressing? The streets? I just hate seeing white people acting black.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaSeem like it will be a good movie, I hope they have more BLACK people in this one then that last one. From what I&#39;ve seen from the clip, its white kids again, dancing like black people, which I have no problem with white kids using our moves to make money. lol
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song at the end??
I Luvvv it &lt;3
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m excited now to watch this movie...
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshita00:23 - 00:55 song title or artist??
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t like Step up 1.  The dancing didn&#39;t impress me much.  The trailer was dope for 1 but I didn&#39;t like the movie.  This trailer is nice too.  I hope the movie is better than the first.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaI know that these dancers are total posers but damn that chick (Andie not Chase) is fucking Fine-Ass Sexy.
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaI know! That makes me really excited b/c they are both really hot! But I would rather Channing be the main one again! I think that he is much hotter!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaShame on Will Kemp...he&#39;s done classy stuff like all the Adventures in Motion Pictures ballets and &quot;Equus&quot;...this is like Jessica Simpson following the London Symphony Orchestra.

Why can&#39;t &quot;William and Miguel&quot; be released in the US?
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitathats the guy from you got served!! whoa!
bL2wDI-O5YQdelimeterByIshitaChanning Tatum is the hottest! Followed by Rob Hoffman! &lt;3 Luv em.  Luvin this movie! N xcuse me &#39;BBITAO&#39; white ppl cn dance! am sure i&#39;l whip ur ass at a comp!

CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaQUEEN LATIFAH MY MOM
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait and it will be good movie😇😇😇
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawatching this trailer made me cry
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawhat is the title of the song? anyone?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldGTG6iVrU&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a> was their last chance to end the trailer without spoiling the movie anymore.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI just saw a commercial of this. I wanted to watch it again. So here I am. Is this video real like the movie &quot;Heaven is for Real&quot;? I watched that movie. I cried 3 or more times. I really want to watch Miracles from Heaven.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaMovies like these always makes me cry. I just wanna say that God is good and that miracles do happen. :)
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m an atheist
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaSO YOU&#39;RE TELLING ME, THIS TRAILER CAME OUT DURING FALL/WINTER, AND ITS COMING OUT ON EASTER?! AND IT&#39;S A TRUE STORY?! I want to watch this sooooo bad!!!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI came here from Common white girl on Twitter.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshita&quot;who told you you&#39;d be fine?&quot;<br>The thing that you insist she believes in and in turn saw it in her Near Death Experience.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t the father, the new hot doctor from Grey&#39;s Anatomy? 🌚
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what&#39;s the song&#39;s name?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaIts eerie how similar some of this story is to my childhood. When I was little I was in the hospital for 3 months because my organs were shutting down but they didn&#39;t know what was going on or why and so my mom got all frustrated. But I just got cured by a lot of experimental steroids lol
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened I don&#39;t understands?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaahhhh its minx. any one watch the whispers??
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawho is the true story about?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThat is so amazing!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaLook at the flowers, Lizzie.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawhy so long till it comes out the trailer had me in tears cant wait!!!!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaBut if you don&#39;t believe in God why are you going to watch and comment hate on the vide, what&#39;s the point?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWho the fuck is funding these christian propaganda bullshit movies? Fuck this ignorant garbage.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWhat if the girl that was &quot;saved&quot; in this &quot;true&quot; story turned out to be a lesbian? Would she burn in hell forever?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait for this movie
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWell, this didn&#39;t give away the ENTIRE freaking movie. -_-
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait to watch this❤❤
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaOmg I cant belive there gonna put that movie in 2016 Easter! Ps. in still gonna watch it 😇
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaFrom the producers who made a movie on a lie a boy told....yeah, that&#39;s all I need to know.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d like to know what the movie is actually about., and is it playing now; at Regal Theatres?<br> please let me know.  thank you.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitathis is so sad
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaGarner must be low of movie script offers
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaMiracle happen only when we believe....
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWhat name of song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldGTG6iVrU&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a>?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible. Thanks for showing the entire movie so I don&#39;t have to watch it.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m god I&#39;m going to heal one girl, but completely ignore thousands of people being slaughtered in the Middle East&quot;. Yeah he really does seen like a loving god, I should go to church and pray to him
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaJust look at the flowers Lizze, just look at the flowers
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaSi alguien preguntaba el nombre de la canción/ If someone ask for the name of the song is: Fight song by Rachel Platten
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawhats the song?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawell thanks for giving away the ending! !
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI find it funny that people on here just love criticizing the movie and trailer. Yes, the trailer tells how the movie ends, but the movie shows what happens in between. <br>I also find it amusing that people say &quot;I think she broke the branch on purpose.&quot; Yes, because she would want to purposely break a very thick branch BOTH she and her sister were on. Then fall 30 feet to her own entertainment.  If she walked to kill herself, I&#39;m pretty sure she wouldn&#39;t also endanger her sister. This movie is about God saving her from death, and healing her. What would the chance be that she fell just right? Only God could do that.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so sorry but this commercial is about the most poorly done and annoying thing i&#39;ve ever seen
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitait is making me sad:-(
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaMiracles, heaven, and Jennifer Garner don&#39;t exist.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThis story happen in Briaroaks Texas but the fire truck reads Burleson which I find odd. Briaroaks Fire Department responded to that call as well as Cleburne Fire Department but not Burleson at all. Not sure if this is an actual truck from Burleson but would of been nice to acknowledge  the actual fire department that did the rescue. Google Briaroaks Tree Rescue to see the news reports that came out when this happen.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaFELICIDADES A EUGENIO DERBEZ
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so watching this movie!!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaMost doubters or atheist don&#39;t believe in a God because they don&#39;t have a reason to, or they blame God for something that caused them pain. Growth comes through that pain, but most miss that opportunity to grow.... While some may have reasons to doubt the existence of God, I can not. I have experienced the manifestation of a divine presence in my life on many occasions - one that leaves no doubt in my mind, heart and soul that God is Real... So whether you believe it or not doesn&#39;t matter to me, because I&#39;m human, and selfish and apathetic like the rest of you at times.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawarning ...Dont take opinions from ignorant people, God didnt give her disease, we live on corrupt earth but sometime God interferes into peoples lives.. not that He owns us anything .. i personally know some people that as well had similar thing happened to them
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawow
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWell no need to watch the movie now :)
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaFor those people saying the trailer &quot;ruined&quot; the ending of the movie, this was national news a while back. Everybody pretty much knows what happened. So this movie isn&#39;t about plot twists or anything like that. It&#39;s not about the beginning or the end. It&#39;s about the journey.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshita😔
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is stupid, the whole plot is given away..what&#39;s left to watch!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaalguien solo vino a ver a Eugenio derbez o soy la unica 😂😂😂
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaso it was &quot;The captive&quot; now this??? i&#39;m so watching this!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThe first time I saw the trailer I thought the movie was about a little girl being pregnant by Jesus.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitalizzie fuck you!!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaeugenio dervez brought me here :)
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI mean, the trailer just told the whole story. What&#39;s the point in watching?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaY de pronto, comentario salvaje en español aparece, la voy a ver solo por eugenio
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitahi
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWhat disease did the girl have ?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaOh great another 2 hours of grueling Christian propaganda.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWow! Thats going to be stressful.......and sad😢
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitase ve que esta bonita 😫😘<br><br>eugenio derbes ???!!!
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaIve said it once, ill say it again. Why in the fuck would i go watch this now that i know she gets sick, makes drama, then said drama is treated with a dose of falling 30 ft and getting hit in the head. FIRE YOUR Trailer Editor and give me a job. I swear i can do just as good with out ruining the ending before release.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaanother testimony that everybody should know about
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitathe song goes beautifully with this I can&#39;t stop crying
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaOh it&#39;s Lizzie. This is what life was like before the zombies came
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaEUGENIOOOOOOO <br>Eres el Rey Hermano 😂❤💓😎
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaFight Song &lt;3
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaBrighton. &lt;3
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaLudobiko peluche  xhdrbz
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaSomeone know the name of this song ?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaSong?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI have cried so hard.... Thank u for making such movies...
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaEugenio
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaOkay..... But he gave her the disease in the first place?
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaThat made me cry
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI saw this on an ad seems like a good movie
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaToo bad God isn&#39;t real and can&#39;t help you cure anything. Giving God credit for your daughter being cured is extremely disrespectful to doctors, who do all the real work. <br><br>She hit her head and was cured? Wow that&#39;s cool. God just must&#39;ve said &quot;Hey I&#39;m gonna give this girl a disease but I&#39;m gonna cure her when they least expect it! Ha! You just got pranked, bitch!&quot;
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWithout God nothing is possible,for example when Anna fell 30 feet God saved her life and healed her.
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitawhat does she have? :c
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaWhy Sony pictures decided to release it on the next easter, it&#39;a an awards worthy movie and must be released now for the awards season. OMG Jen is captivating with ths killing role,she has to win an oscar with her reactions facial expressions tone of her voice
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitathe girl on the tree with anna is played by brighton sharbino
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this movie😁✌✌✌

CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome
CldGTG6iVrUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m early so give me likes
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaShit! Hollywood is out of idea. Theyre always reviving old movies. Hahaha
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing! And the amount of racist assholes commenting on this is sickening. Take your bigotted opinions elsewhere, perhaps to a lake where you can drown.<br>I&#39;m so excited for this. It looks incredibly cute and like it will be really good fun!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDid you hear they are remaking Bad Boyz? It is starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. And they are remaking Blade as well. It is starring Chris Pine. OH WAIT - that would never happen because it would be deemed racist.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaJust, yes. Yes. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitalooks cute but dear god WHY cameron diaz?
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaWow, just wow. This looks like complete and utter shit, just like 99% of all remakes. Hollywood has nothing left. Cameron Diaz peaked when she had jizz in her hair.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaSo many racist assholes....cant....take it
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaCameron Diaz hasn&#39;t given a good performance in about 10 years.. why do I like her?
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaYou can&#39;t remake classics :&#39;(
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitathis is where you know hollywood is running out of ideas. jamie foxx should be in better movies than remakes
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaUsually I don&#39;t care much for modern remakes, but this does actually look super super sweet, and just looking at this Annie&#39;s smile makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I hope it does well~ <br>((If nothing else, just to spite the racists in the comment section. Gosh I hope this doesn&#39;t end up as another Rue hatestorm.))
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaFirst Watch: Eh I don&#39;t know<br>Second Watch: &quot;Tomorrow&quot; sounds cool<br>Third Watch: I can&#39;t wait for this movie!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI think it looks good i think i will like it i love the original
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaJust give me Carol Burnett please. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the classic you know with the awesome addition of African Americans and the not-so-awesome addition of auto tune.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaNOOOOOOOOO NO NONO WHYYY??!! WHY???? JUST WHY I HAVE LITERALLY NO WORDS HERE WHY WHY WHY
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI see parodies of this being better than this XD
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks horrible!!!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaHEREEEE COMEEE THE RACSISTSSSSSS.<br><br>My Opinion: This is cute, everyone else can fuck off.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/nasLuiP-1E0?t=1m05s">1:05</a> the girl on the right looks more like anie
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaNext year&#39;s winner for Worst Picture of the Year
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaLook at her hair! Its like super cute!!!!! And the singing! CUTE! Okay I&#39;m alright, but this whole movie looks really sweet, I&#39;m going to have to watch the older Annie, then watch this.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaListen I have to say I can&#39;t stand watching this. I need to tell you I&#39;m 15, I&#39;m not racist, not Caucasian, and I&#39;m part black. Annie was one of those childhood movies that stuck with me. Listen I&#39;m not trying to be or sound racist and please look at this in a non racist way, you should never change the race of the main character. Sure little changes here and their but really the race? It doesn&#39;t matter if you change a supporting characters race like Jamie foxs character. That&#39;s fine. But really Annie !!? She&#39;s just not Annie to me. The movie looks pretty good but I don&#39;t want it to replace or change the image of Annie
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitai think it looks like a cute little modern spinoff of the classic and it looks pretty good! i bet most people are slamming on it cus of the racial diversity. really guys, it&#39;s 2014, grow up
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaOMG!!! this sucks
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDoge at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasLuiP-1E0&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> running to catch the shuttle to the moon
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitacame in expecting distastful racist trolls, found none, leaving pleased. hope for the human race :)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually pretty excited for this but it doesn&#39;t look like they translated Ms Hannigan well at all
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks cute! Some of the people in this comment feed, seriously need to calm down.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitathe other Annie sang better lol
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDiaz as Mr. Hannigan?  no.   Tyler Perry?  now we&#39;re getting interesting.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaOh Jesus...what a shit-show THIS will be.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaRacists can go tie a weight to their ankles and jump in a frozen lake. This movie looks so cute, I&#39;m going to see it for sure :D
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks epically awful. Why change the original dialogue? Why change the theme from a feel-good Great Depression story? Why use autotune? Why Cameron Diaz? 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD I&#39;M SO EXCITED. THIS LOOKS <b>AWESOME</b>
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaAnnie is black ?? my whole life is a lie?!!<br>what about Tibbers assholes ?
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not a huge fan of Cameron Diaz in this adaptation, but oh my God did Quvenzhané Wallis win my heart again. &lt;3 Plus, I can&#39;t stop listening to this version of Tomorrow!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThank God it&#39;s Jamie Foxx and not someone like Tyler Perry.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThey should of got jessica lange for the part not cameron diaz!    <br>(Rolls eyes)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDear Will Smith: Wasn&#39;t you foisting After Earth as a vehicle for Jaden enough????
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThe auto-tuned singing in this offends me...a lot.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI think it looks great! Can&#39;t wait to see it.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not trying to be mean, but this my opinion: it looks awful. Cameron Diaz made me cringe the moment she was on screen. It looks like they&#39;re trying to take the glossiest visions of LA and put them in NYC. That does NOT work. It will NEVER work.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI am stupidly pumped for this.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThere have been approximately 500 remakes of Annie remakes with a bunch of little white girls. Let the black girl have her chance. Y&#39;all don&#39;t matter. &gt;.&gt;
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDear God... this is the worst....
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaHey. Shut up. Give the movie a chance god-damn it! Same thing happened with Frozen and it won the Oscars! So, never judge a movie by the trailer. (plus, I really actually want to see this movie because the old one isn&#39;t my favorite. Musical is better. X3)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitathis sucks
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThere are so many good actresses, why cameron diaz?
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaWhat in the blue blazes was this?!? Congrats Sony, you just &quot;Catwomaned&quot; Annie...
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI actually don&#39;t mind the diverse cast.... but hate that they took it out of the 30s
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m down for everything in this trailer except Diaz, her scenes were just downright uncomfortable.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaOoooooh I&#39;m looking forward to this one.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think they&#39;re trying to remake the original more than they&#39;re trying to make a modern version of the original. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll beat the original because the original is amazing. I don&#39;t wish to judge it but the fact that Quvenzhané Wallis is playing Annie gives me hope, she is an amazing little actress and was amazing in Beasts of the Southern Wild.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is so important.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaLooks like a cute spin-off. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaSo basically they are trying to ruin a classic by having the story line of the movie &#39;The Game Plan&#39; featuring The Rock which was one of the worst movie ever made in the 2000&#39;s &amp; on top of that, they chose that corny clown Cameron Diaz, smh. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaWhy.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to this! Plus it&#39;s GREAT to finally see a movie with not only a female protagonist but a person of color as well. I think this version will be unique enough that it&#39;s worth watching even if you&#39;ve seen the original movie a thousand times but similar enough that you can appreciate it as the same story. I hope I&#39;ll enjoy it in theaters :)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t decide if I wanna see this or not...
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaAt least they are using the WTC for something now...
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks so adorable I can&#39;t wait to see this 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a travesty :((
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI know Cameron Diaz was once in porn, but is she still blowing people to get these roles? She&#39;s just fucking terrible.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m ashamed at all of these hater comments &gt;:C I think this movie is going to be amazing if you guys watch it WITH AN OPEN MIND.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI am excited for this, actually. Obviously it&#39;s not gonna even match up to the original, because people never love a remake even if the remake is better. <br><br>This remake will pretty obviously not be better. But it&#39;ll still be fun, musical, cheesy, and a perfect Christmas film. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaFINALLY
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know.  I grew up with the Original Broadway Cast soundtrack, and I honestly see no problems with this.  Looks like a pretty interesting update, and I am always here for Quvenzhané Wallis.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaWhile i absolutely appreciate the diverse casting in this, seriously???? whose idea was it to cast Cameron Diaz she&#39;s awful!!!!!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even really remember what happens in the original Annie but I&#39;m excited to see this
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitawhat a beautiful reinvention of the original movie!!!! i mean obviously they&#39;re different stories (one being modern) but i think it&#39;s gonna be fantastic!! plus i love that the 2 main characters are african american. it&#39;s always great to have diversity in movies :)))))
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaIn the end instead of singing Tomorrow, Annie sings I whip hair back and forth!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be AWESOME.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitalooks cute and fun :)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaIM SO EXCITED
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think we should compare this to the original, which was amazing. I&#39;m looking forward to see this movie. :) 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like it could be awesome. (And yes, I am a big fan of the 1982 version as well.)
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitathis looks fucking awful, sorry but this has NOTHING on the original 1982 version, infact the 1982 version shits all over this one in every way because cameron diaz is a crap actor, I grew up with the 1982 version and thats how its going to stay!!!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually excited for this !
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s with all the hate? It looks like a cute modern remake of a beloved musical created in order to bring it to a new generation. This isn&#39;t the 1982 version, true, but then again the 1982 version was not the original radio drama either. And it&#39;s just a first trailer anyway. So let&#39;s stop the hate. After all, this is supposed to be a positive story. So let&#39;s be positive! You&#39;re Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like shit like horrible shit
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaouch 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know why that huge back lash this movie looks pretty good to me. but they can drop cameran Diaz in place of another to make it better.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaAt first i was kinda mad they were making yet another remake, but then i thought it could work.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks HORRIBLE!  The original Anne is the greatest, I grew up with that.  How actors like Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx could be associated with the shit of a remake is beyond me and below them.  This is going to bomb at the box office.  And if it doesn&#39;t, it will inevitable be forgotten about in time while the original with still be the only one thought about.﻿
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaAwesome! 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaAwesome! 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaCameron Diaz is fucking awful.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaNo
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis will be good 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaYou know what, on paper this sounds ridiculous, but watching this trailer i got goosebumps when &quot;Tomorrow&quot; started playing. And it&#39;s looking for a Christmas release? I&#39;ll give it a chance.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaim not digging this. it looks like a cheap, mediocre, fake cop-out. its like sony is trying to milk the cash the cow too hard
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaLove it!!!!!!!!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaIt doesn&#39;t look very good but at least Doge is in the movie!
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis kind of gave me goose bumps, especially during the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; song. 
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaDat Windows 8 product placement... in the trailer, can&#39;t imagine how bad it will be in the movie.
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaCHRISTMAS ?? OH GOD
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaLooks lame compared to others
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaOK, Sony Pictures... who died and made Oscar winner Jamie Foxx Daddy Warbucks?
nasLuiP-1E0delimeterByIshitaThis looks so stupid.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, with a fantastic Soundtrack !
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitathe only movie that you will see Paul McCartney and Kurt Cobain at the same time
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaHey DUDE

spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaDolores
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaGhost Rider brought me here, one of the most underrated superhero movies in my opinion alongside Superman Returns.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaCan someone help me? Where can I find this movie to watch?
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer in theatres in front of Liscense to Wed. Michael Clayton &amp; Good Luck Chuck were also shown
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie!! 😉💗❤️💗
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer tells us the whole movie
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaTo this day, one of my favourite movies of all time. Went to Vietnam earlier this year and it just hits different now. Still stunning, but even more poignant at went down in that war. Too many lives lost on both sides.<br>And for what? <br>This movie is just a stunning representation of that struggle.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s 3am and while i was trying to fall asleep a vivid memory of this trailer just randomly popped in my head. I first saw it when i saw spiderman 3 when i was little and for some reason this trailer used to always freak me out.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI first watched this trailer when I was 11 years old. And for so many years I’ve been looking for this trailer. I’m 24 now and I can’t believe I actually found this. I would often find myself over the years humming the songs from this trailer and not knowing what those songs are or what this movie was. It was driving me crazy for so long.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitadolores
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaIs that dolores?
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer as a child,in the years since then I always thought that maybe i had imagined or dreamed up this movie but when i recently read a movie review by roger ebert i was sure this was it and what do you know it was. thank you roger ebert even in these crazy times beyond the grave you helped me at least solve one thing
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis was my favorite movie when i was like 4-9 and I completely forgot about it but its such a great movie. Im 14 now and still love it. Lol thx dad
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThese violent delights have violent ends
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaHow also clicked on this video because of Dolores picture?
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaDeloris!
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshita&quot;We&#39;re in the middle of a revolution, Jude. And what are you doing? Doodles and cartoons?&quot; That line hit me hard.

spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaHi Dolores.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie❤️❤️❤️
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThey lived without rules, and they loved without fear, but as the world changed so did they.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was box office flop....

spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshita15 seconds in and I&#39;m already in love. Stellar song choice and presentation of it!! 👏👏👏
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaIt should have has a dash more originality, it should have focused on Britain and it should have had a likable main character
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaMi sueño es q pongan esta peli em Netflix
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI just want to say this lyrics the beatles
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThey took acid.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitai love the beatles, and i love how influential they’ve been for such a long time. this movie is one of my favorites because of the music, acting, and story line. it’s just so perfect and beautiful.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this when I was still in College. Came back here because I heard  Evan&#39;s voice in Frozen 2.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI didnt like this movies but I love the beatles
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s here from the Ghost Rider DVD
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaWhat a gross misrepresentation of this film
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI saw the movie a few years ago after doing finals in my language arts class with one of my favorite teachers. I remember being absolutely taken away by it and I’m SO GLAD I didn’t see this trailer beforehand, otherwise I would have never watched the movie, it ruins EVERYTHING in it.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie as bad as it is, still better and more respectful to The Beatle&#39;s music in comparison to Yesterday (2019).
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitathis movie is such a boomer movie. it&#39;s like purpose-made for them. lol 70million budget 20millon box. kinda is so boomer
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaOMG I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s DOLORES from westworld omg omg
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaLegend says this movie marked the end of the emo era, transforming them into hipsters.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaPerfect to watch it on shroom 🙈
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitadid anybody know, what &quot;anti-war music&quot; is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spf7RULGNOU&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a>
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThe only time I watched this I was high af, don&#39;t really remember most of it, but I remember continuously thinking &quot;wtf is going on&quot;.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaNot to take away from YESTERDAY but ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is way better.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaAt least the soundtrack is distributed by UMG were The Beatles is from under Calderstone. <br><br><br>NOT SONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaHad to come back and watch this trailer after watching Yesterday last night. Across the Universe remains the best Beatles tribute movie.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaJesus, I remember seeing this trailer when I was 9 in the trailer section in the spiderman 3 special features. I know it&#39;s weird but it&#39;s what I remember.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was my first introduction/education on the Beatles music at the age of 16. I love the soundtrack!
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaMust watch coz i luv Beatles😍
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie! I do wish this version of ‘Girl’ was longer though!
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThe Beatles are the best band ever
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshita2019
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI remember when I went to go see Spiderman 3 this trailer was played before it.  All the surrealism aspects of it tripped me out. I immediately searched for it again once I got home.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaYesterday brought me here
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaYesterday brought me here
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has my heart

spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaWake up, Dolores. Do you know where you are?
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitahorrible movie, when I saw it theaters back in 2007 I thought it was &quot;amazing&quot; but it&#39;s horrible lol, the concept is good but Jesus Christ...this movie was one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen lol

spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer before watching Ghost Rider
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI was 2 when I saw this trailer, I was really scared...but I knew deep down that this movie had concept. It&#39;s art. [Also Chenle is quaking]
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaI just watched it last night at the theater, the Auditorium was empty. just me and my mom. it was awesome to be 10 years after the release of the movie and live again that experience......<br><br>la pusieron de nuevo en el cine anoche y la sala estaba vacía, sólo mi má y yo. la disfrutamos mucho.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaThey cut out a lot of flying titles near the end from the original.
spf7RULGNOUdelimeterByIshitaSo amazing

_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what you guys say, we need movies like this so I can show something to my little cousin and her cat-loving grandma when I babysit them.

_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitawhen the internet version drops probably sooner than later i&#39;m watching!
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaOMG that song at the beginning (first 15 seconds of the trailer) is a TOTAL ripoff of the song &quot;Trouble&quot; by Iggy Azalea/Jennifer Hudson. And yes it is a RIPOFF... the notes are different from the real song, so this definitely is no &quot;instrumental cover&quot;
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshita<b>South Park Narrator</b><br><br>KEVIN SPACEY IS A RICH BUSINESSMAN WHO HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANT<br>BUT ONE DAY, HE WOKE UP AS A CAT!<br>AND NOW<br>HE WILL FIND OUT<br>THAT TO BE A CAT TAKES MORE THAN JUST NINE LIVES
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitathis is a prank
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThere are absolutely no people of color in this movie!!!
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it might be good up until the point he turned into a cat.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshita...what?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitawow this looks so bad holy shit, how much money did they pay the actors?!

_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaStarted out &quot;Oh I love Kevin Spacey&quot;<br>Ended &quot;I just lost all respect for Kevin Spacey&quot;

_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaWTF....
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitareminds me of click
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaCant wait.  Poopie Box.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaGet paid, get laid.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaSo, a shitty ripoff of Shaggy Dog? Which was, you know, another shitty movie?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so 90&#39;s!
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever seen. And why does the cgi look like crap?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with Walken being the weird salesman all the time, Click and now this?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaOMG! This is exactly like shaggy dog, but cat version.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jHA97HzhxE&amp;t=0m34s">0:34</a> the real celebrity is there ... LIL BUB
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaDid I seriously just see Frank Underwood become a cat in this shitty trailer? What the fuck
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaClick 2?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaFUCK THIS SHIT. &gt;:( This is the type of crap that makes me  want to just bash my head in to the wall until everything goes black.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIt hurts my heart to see Kevin Spacey be a part of something like this
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m out of words! The fuck is this garbage!?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell!?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaD<br><br>A<br><br>D<br><br>D<br><br>Y<br><br>C<br><br>A<br><br>T!
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIs this shit for real?<br>How is him turning into a cat gonna make him reconnect with his family? Maybe it will<br>be like Shaggy Dog or whatever it was called.&quot;Tim Allen&quot;
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIs this some sort of sick joke
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaMan... this movie HAS to be fake...
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI thought we where done with the crappy &quot;live action talking animal family movies&quot;. Why? just WHY???
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks fucking atrocious
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaNo, Kevin Spacey!  Don&#39;t enter your late period De Niro phase!
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most generic movie ever created. it&#39;s like a comedy sketch.<br>Business man, Neglects innocent little girl/boy, staring a talking animal, a generic pop song in the trailer, bad CGI, and theres a mean blond woman in there somewhere. Oh, and it&#39;s not funny.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI only came to this video becuase I saw lil bub was going to be in this
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThought it would be similar to &quot;Click&quot; (2006) until the damn cat part. Why a bloody cat?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIs this some sort of elaborate prank?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaSo its the same EXACT movie as the Shaggy Dog, but with a Cat and also worse
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitawhy the fuck would anyone think this movie was a good idea
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshita100 Deeds for Frank Underwood coming to Nickelodeon this summer.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaWow... They actually used reverse - repeats for the pull ups. Oh god... How does this happen?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitai just got cancer, thanks frank underwood
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI just witnessed the death of Keyser Söze.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThis can&#39;t be real...
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaanother movie were a man turns into an animal
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaI know this is gonna be a box-office flop, but I might still see it, since I happen to be both a cat owner/lover.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaIt seems stupid but it&#39;s still cute.
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaAre we sure this isn&#39;t a Jimmy Kimmel skit...?
_jHA97HzhxEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks better than Suicide Squad
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita2013 will be a scifi year! cant wait!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not a prehistoric earth. 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaWill Smith is the coolest dad ever. Why couldn&#39;t I have a cool dad like that! Nvrmind, my kid is gonna be Tony Stark goddammit. 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitalooks good
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaMan, Earth really got flipped, turned upside down.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitawell, so probably you  didnt watch Pursuit Of Happiness 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaso will smith gets to be in a movie with his son. thats pretty cool.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLife of Legend
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitadamn too bad, cause i have made a vow to never ever watch another m night shyamalan movie ever again
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaM. Night don&#39;t ruin this one
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great! I&#39;m so looking forward to this! :D
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaM Night is just terrible.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI am legend 2xAvatar lol
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitadamn how m night shyamalan has fallen, they dont even use his name to sell the movie, or else noone would go see it if they knew
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita(cue quote from Independence Day) &quot;Welcome To Earth!!&quot;
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaOh that its Earth? ya and even in the title kind of. I wonder if there will be another twist. Hmm who knows but its got my interest
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks kind of awesome
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaOkay. Time to get your profile deleted from YouTube. 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitago fuck yourself, pig
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaAvatar and hunger games?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaAvatar with black people
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good M Night might be out of the slump finally

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaat first i thought this was i am legend 2...
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI like that! So the environment, to protect itself from us, has evolved to kill us. This eventually driving us from the planet.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaGary Whitta Though, hes awesome :) Like Book of Eli?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaCool!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaoh god, those eyes at 0:44 give off the spine chilling feeling as his did in I am Legend.
I hope this movie is amazing 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaFor two minutes it looked epic, then i learned it&#39;s directed by M. Night Shyamalan. So it&#39;s going to be a POS.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaEvery face I&#39;ve seen Jaden make in the trailer, has been a scared shitless one. I hope he doesn&#39;t stay in that face for most of the movie.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThere are no bad Will Smith movies. Only good ones and mediocre ones. There are no bad M. Night movies. Only good ones and mediocre ones. Jaden? Still remains to be seen, but let&#39;s give him the benefit of the doubt.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaITS A DREEEEAAAAMMMM!!!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaholy fuck come out now!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI think it will be good. :)
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitapursuit of happyness 2 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaJaden smith looks exactly like me like its freaky...
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaplease let it be good...please let it be good....please let it be good...please let it have no moronic twist at the end.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaOnly Shyamalan movies that were good was the sixth sense and unbreakable. Hopefully this movie won&#39;t be another one of his trash because Will Smith only pick scripts that are good.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI love Will Smith and his movies, but this is the first time I&#39;ve been skeptical about a Smith movie. I think its because of his accent and the amount of sci-fi in this movie. I&#39;m not a huge sci fi fan, but this trailer has me wanting more. I still can&#39;t wait to see it. Hopefully Shyamalan won&#39;t tarnish Smith&#39;s career
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThankfully he&#39;s not writing this film cause he can&#39;t write for shit.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good u my friend dont have good opinions on movies!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t be any worse than the last film he made. *shudders* god I hate that movie.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitajust FYI this movie is directed by M Night Shyamalan
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLooks balloks
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaMore like Morgan Freeman
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaiam legend meet avatar
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaAlready a #MustSee!!!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait!! The amount of times iv watched a will smith movie marathon, just waiting for his next film which was this. Pretty keen.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!!!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaomg!!! the will smith´s son is a copy-paste of will smith!!! O.O
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaBadass
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like avatar meets start trek rip off
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaGarry Whitta. 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaYeah Basically, one thing is for sure 2013 Is LOOKING SWEET FOR SCI-FI Fans.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll check it out if I heard good things about it.  
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaShould we all guess the twist at the end now or wait?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita@Johnywang1 : Yeah its good .....but a bit racist . It goes for all of us .....even if they got civilized late
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThe music is amazing
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLoved The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. The Village alot of ppl didnt like but i thought it was interesting and pretty good. Then Shyamalan really fell. Hoping he gets back on track here!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita@johnywang1.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaits not a big deal for them.. i mean they basically knew all this stuff from africa! (haha, bring it people, u know it was a solid joke!)
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI am actually intrigued by this. The visuals look stunning. Even though it is directed by Shamalayn, I will go see this movie for Will and Jaden. And it appears Jaden is going to be carrying most of this film on his own. He was great in Pursuit Of Happiness and the Karate Kid remake. But I really hoped he has inherited his dad&#39;s serious acting chops and uses them well to pull this off.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI hope this is a good movie. It should be anyway because Will Smith is in it lol
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert: Will dies.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI am robot, legend ... earth..!       fuck! IM MOHAMED ALI IN SPACE! AND MY SIDE KICK IS KARATE  KID!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible, but, m night shyamalan trailers have fooled me once before... *cough cough* Airbender *cough*
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaVery interested in this one!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaCould somebody hand me some new pants please?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI have lost all faith in fucking Shamalama Ding Dong... after TLAB... But I love Will Smith... FUCK!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitalol yes it does look amazing
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaIf you believe Jurassic Park, then life finds a way. xD
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaNo &quot;M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s After Earth&quot; ... just &quot;After Earth&quot; ... oh how the mighty have fallen.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans.&quot; That&#39;s pretty Lamarckism
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI think this is how Jaden and Will enjoy their father and son moment. Family hobby lol

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck Jaden looks 5 years older than he did in karate kid
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaApparently it&#39;s up to Will Smith and his son to re-populate the human species...That&#39;s nice..
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaNope 

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis and Oblivion? Why do similar movies come out nearly at the same time?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitawait a second dont tell me MR M KNIGHT is makeing this one ,if so GOD HELP US ALL!!!.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitadamned scientologists ...
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaOh my god, i seriously do not like jayden smith
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshita i like black ops 2 
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI fucking hate Will Smith&#39;s kid
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaFucking epic o_o gotta say he&#39;s grown so much and by time he might step into his father&#39;s shoes one day although he has to be good at acting :) i&#39;ma be sure to watch this
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitathis is the UK trailer

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitalooks like complete shit
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitatHe oNly tHing tHat aNnoys mE mOre tHen tHe wAy yOu tYpe, iS tHe wAy tHis iS wRitten

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaomg will smith looks so young!!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaJudging From How Much We Saw Of His Son Being Solo I Am Guessing Will Dies
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaHear the weird accent will smith has?
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaastiggg :D Will and Jaden!!! XD
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaalthough looks intresting.

CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitait wont play all i see is black
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaI like them both, although I don&#39;t think father and son should play. (act) father and son.
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaIs easy to get movie and music deals when your daddy is Will Smith
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaSHMOES!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks cool and different!!
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitafather and son... kinda weird
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaActually interested in this one, if it is good, I MIGHT be able to forgive Airbender....maybe
CZIt20emgLYdelimeterByIshitaMr Will is there so no question this is in my watch list!
