dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshitaSandra Bullock. Attractive. Smart. Funny. Talented.  She is the TOTAL PACKAGE.
dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshitaLOL! I just love Sandra Bullock she is so darn funny and cute :)
dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshitaOkay... I haven&#39;t seen the film yet but it looks like a bad fanfiction. The &quot;eww I saw you naked&quot; thing has been done way too many times.
dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m all for anyone marrying, who wants to. Also, I would love to see movies of not hetero relationships. I was lamenting on the boring romantic comedies. They are all the same. People have no imagination anymore.
dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshitaGreat... another story about straight relationships.  They get to marry for the wrong reasons.  I can&#39;t marry here in my great hate state of California for the right reasons...
dbYST9QhCYYdelimeterByIshita1:30 repeat several times n&#39; u will hear Renold said cum to Sandra while she said Alaska in a funny way!!

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaNina Simone‚Äôs song thoüôåüèªüôåüèª
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI know that 1955 was a desired year to love and live in and this was clearly seen by the way the artist set stage with its cars and artifacts throughout the movie. This movie has a universe of information and knowledge on how actors need to perform Maybe when we start watching this movie you will see what I am describing. This movie at first was skeptical and I was slightly concerned however it became masterpiece within a few minutes. To interact with actual actors is phenomenal. As a clever director does there was tons of irony , symbolism and procrastination to keep you at the end of your seat. Practically every scene was a masterpiece. Is the whole endeavor of moving to Paris a bright choice ? Turn on the television, find the movie , place on your undivided attention. The movie feels pleasure, it feels learned, it feels good , it feels sad , it feels like a lovely surprise. A small but very important movie and win or was it a loss of heart as I rank this a 9 !
<br>Final Verdict: Revolutionary Road is a must see movie.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaWho would&#39;ve thought that owning a giant house, having a job and being married to a person who looked like Kate Winslet (while you look like Leo DiCaprio) could be so horrifying. Only in the US
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaWtf I didn&#39;t know they made another movie. I gotta watch this..gonna get off to to this...
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaAgatha??

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe 1950&#39;s model was that a guy would give his best years to the industrial complex and his wife would be his personal servant at home taking care of his needs.

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaSo many unanswered questions

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaNow...if Netflix could get it&#39;s act together, I could watch this movie for free...I hate Streaming services... Straight to DVD much better
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitadoesnt there house look like the mike wheeler and nancy&#39;s house off of stranger things
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie never fails at giving me this feeling of both emptiness and hopelessness I‚Äôve never felt before. <br>This is like the unhappy ending I didn‚Äôt want for Jack and Rose.

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI dont know how to feel  about this movie . i love kate and leo but it kind of ruined the titanic story and the chemistry between them for me ,  the movie was a little bit to depressive . <br>Try to forget this asap .
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaAmerican Beauty: Titanic Drift

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaPlenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness. <br><br>ONE OF THE BEST LINES I&#39;VE EVER HEARD IN A MOVIE.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI love their chemistry, very interesting that could captures everyone&#39;s heart... They are both beautiful and magnificient, so perfect partner in all their scenes.

WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitathis movie is truly amazing
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaIn titanic their ship sank....here their relation sinks
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI always have this film in the back of my mind, it has such an important message to me of how you should always try and follow your dreams rather than waste your one and only life being just another &#39;brick in the wall&#39;.<br>Unless of course that is how you want to live your life, but at the end of the day so many of us are so damned conformist.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaIt looks like the Titanic, but on land.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is really telling a story which i have never seen in bollywood movies
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaGood story with good acting..<br>Beautiful way of presenting. misunderstanding can leads to this <br>Emptiness and hopelessness üò≠
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitalooks like a great one for date night
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI literally can&#39;t find it in myself to feel that Kate is a good actress. I really want to because I think she&#39;s a great person, but there&#39;s just something missing for me with her acting ability.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshita2 of the most underrated talents in cinema.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the problem of many couples..!!!!
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitathis is way better than marriage story
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe acting in this movie was out of this world
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe original Marriage Story
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe Fact that The director Of the Film Was Kate Winslet&#39;s Wife at the time, was so weird
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe Fact that The director Of the Film Was Kate winslet&#39;s Wife at the time, was so weird
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t watch this movie if you love Titanic, it will ruin everything...
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still depressed after watching titanic but I want to watch this movie too.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaJack and Rose reincarnated to continue the story they were supposed to have if only got off of that ship . . .
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThis is such a good film.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t Jack and Rose. It&#39;s their evil twins, Jerk Dawson and Rose DeWittless Buttkicker.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe music!!!
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI‚Äôve wasted 1h 59m of my life...
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI Didn‚Äôt Want This Movie To Win A Lot Of Awards Because There Was Too Much Arguing In It
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitathis is what would have happened if Jack survived in Titanic
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaBoth DiCaprio and Winslet at the top of their game! A fantastically depressing movie with outstanding performances! WOW!
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaJack dies ..April dies..oh no..happy ending pleaseüôèüôè
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaProbably the most underrated movie with Leonardo DiCaprio
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitawhat the name of the song in the tralier??????
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI never heard of this movie, I want to see this.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGS9M6uiOW4&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> A nod to the Titanic steamy car scene. Whether it was intentional or not. . .Nice! It&#39;s so weird that her husband directed her in this film with Leo. They are such an iconic movie couple. There were a lot of love scenes in this film! I would say, idk how Sam and Kate did it, but they divorced shortly after this film was made. Granted it might&#39;ve had something to do with Sam&#39;s affair.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaI did&#39;nt get thr story of the movie until the end..just watched it coz of the two...(L &amp; K)
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaseems much more depressing than titanic.
WGS9M6uiOW4delimeterByIshitaThe trailer reveal an exceptional role by Kate Winslet, gradually escalating storyline, and indeed we can&#39;t ignore Hollywood baby face Leonardo.

uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE IS CULT CLASSIC. I LOVE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF JEREMY RUNNER.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaBank jobs were a Charlestown Right of Passage for aspiring wise-guys and dope fiends, they are marked by their consistent ability to foul them up, get pinched and go to the can. Seriously, I want to watch a film with the main Boston area car/loser on top of it?
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaMy uncle is in there!!
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaFinally a decent looking movie.

uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThis , in my opinion,  was Ben Affleck&#39;s greatest performance period !!!    The movie is in the circle with scarface and heat!!!!
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaCaught on evidence brought me here
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThe movie wasnt a true story it was based off a book. And the guy that ben affleck played was a fictional character

uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaIs his really based on a true story? The only commonality seems to be the bank robbery lol
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaBen played me. Take 150 n go.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why the guy from Caught in Providence lied about the movie being about him. The movie isn&#39;t even based upon a true story.

uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaNow that&#39;s a mf&#39;n trailer. Had me interested like I never seen it
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie!!!!
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaOutstanding movie ü§îü§îü§î ,big town costly money Vs small town  expenditure üí∞ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaone of the most underrated movies
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaFor me this was his best even more than Argo
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaJeremy Renner looks soo good here.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was EPICCCCCCCC
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaIs this worth watching? It looks good, and Legendary Entertainment is my favorite movie studio
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaSo Batman and Hawkeye were Boston bank robbers before parting away and becoming superheroes? No doubt why they chose rival cinematic universes. The Town explains it all.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaCollaboration between Bruce Batfleck Wayne with Clint Hawkeye Barton üëç
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThe subsequent crime sagas - Takers, The Dark Knight, The Town, and Den of Thieves - ALL of them ‚Äúborrow‚Äù from the gold standard modern masterpiece - Heat .. The Town mirrors it quite a bit; it‚Äôs more or less an east coast version of it
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshita&quot;I like to have a good cry at the nail salon&quot;.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies..and yes - I was for the bank robbers
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitadope movie! great directing by ben affleck
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaHere after mentions big Joey Diaz podcast
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaAfter Will Hunting left without a word. No good bye. No see ya later. No nothing. Just left.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaTo bad you have to listen  to Boston accents
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThe theatrical cut is solid but the extended cut is on the level of HEAT. It&#39;s a crime masterpiece in my opinion. Great book too btw!
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaSuper super underrated movie.<br><br>Arguably the best bank robbery movie created.<br><br>Affleck was outstanding. Better Ben than Argo.<br><br>For me this movie deserves an 8.0-8.2 on IMDB
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaI have to watch this NOW
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaDoug is an redeemable hero of this crime movie.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaBest movie I‚Äôve seen by far. Didn‚Äôt know Ben affleck can pull on both acting and directing.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the most underrated movies I have ever watched.
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaExcellent film. Got robbed of several Academy Award nominations. The score in the trailer is a gem üëåüëåüëåüëå
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was really good AND the best Affleck movie ever. This is the real Ben
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaJe veut le film complet
uAjECYnrYksdelimeterByIshitaThis is such a good movie! One of my all time faves.

l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaAnd the award for the shittiest comedy written by white people goes to.....
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaMan.....could&#39;ve sworn I&#39;ve seen will Ferrell in another comedy where he has something puncturing his skin.........hhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is a movie that looks like it&#39;ll be so bad it&#39;ll be amazing XD
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitahmmm...
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaI am a fan of Kevin hart and this movie looks like it could be funny, but I am afraid Kevin has been doing too many movies and we will all have fatigue of him if you don&#39;t already 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song in the beginning
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaits not that funny!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaI just got hard 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThe original working title was &quot;The Prison Ringer.&quot;Ôªø
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitayo, I&#39;m already cracking up @ this! wow
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaAnother big Stan
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song called at the very begaining
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitahaha..hah...h prison rape jokes, that&#39;s just hilarious.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaToo many stereotypes. 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaLike both those guys, but that movie looks like shit. 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaMalibu&#39;s Most Wanted Yall 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWedding Ringer was fucking hilarious. Not too sure about this. Ferrell is very hit and miss for me. 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at the beginning
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshita			 				 				4c4541524e2e2041574152452e				 			 			
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait xD

l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the second song in the trailer? Is it lil Jon?
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThis film is for black. The white house is trying to rehabilitate for Ferguson.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was going to about getting hard......oops
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaNot usually a Will Ferrel Fan but this looks hilarious. 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawow this looks awful¬†

l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaREAL DUMB SHIT
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaSong at the beginning ? 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaLol
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaBlack dude here (Yes, Black people watch BBT). <b>Huge</b> Will Ferrell fan here. I hate this movie already.¬†Typical White/Asian Male + Black Male Script.<br><br>Stereotype: Corny White guy.<br>Stereotype: Hip, street savvy Black guy.<br><br>Oh, wait! But here&#39;s the twist, you guys. The Black guy doesn&#39;t fit the stereotype - he&#39;s gonna ACT like he fits the stereotype!¬†<br><br>Clever!<br><br>Boxing them in merely restricted two <b>EXCELLENT</b> comedians. Could have been a classic film.¬†Now it&#39;s merely a cliche.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitathis could be funny or it could be trash...who knows. I&#39;ll check it though.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaEvery movie kevin Hart is in is a good one!!!!!!!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaholy shit this looks funny
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaIma watch this movie while being stoned 
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitareminds me of the movie Big Stan
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaMore sterotypical movies If any blacks are reading this comment dont watch tv and ignore hollywood africans have invented %80 of modern technology dont pay attention to this propaganda
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe everyone is hating on Kevin Hart his a great comedian so why is everyone dissing him
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaOhhh i seee, this is Big Stan remake. Lol
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaAnything Will Ferrel does makes me laugh, I mean I could watch him poo for 2 hours... So in other words: This movie will be AWESOME!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaKeep gettin them chex Kev
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawill ferrell and kevin hard, thats a comedy by itself! this is gonna be the best comedy of the year!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t there a Rob Schneider movie with a very similar plot?
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawhy kevin hart he sucks
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is be a good and hell comedy.Good Bravo and Good Luck of the movie.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaI seen a well known movie like this before...
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitai hate black &quot;culture&quot; nowadays. They lost their path in the 70&#39;s-80&#39;s :-(
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is in the beggining?¬†
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThat last car scene kinda reminds me of Due Date scene in the car when Zack shoots Ironman :)
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaEven if it is 80% terrible, you know it is going to have a few good scenes that make you fall down laughing.
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitawhats the song towards the end?
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaAlison brie!!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaWhen she hit him I lost it lololololol
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be hilarious Will and Kevin!!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaGod this movie looks like trash! I&#39;m getting tired of Kevin Hart! Apparently that car didn&#39;t hit him hard enough....
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaBro stop.. STOP.  To funny lol
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaThey filmed in Louisiana?! I knew it the second I saw some of the scenes! Specially I always go to the park where he picks a fight with those big dudes. It&#39;s cool seeing local areas to you on the big screen!
l5lojEIitNwdelimeterByIshitaAlmost exactly the same as Big Stan starring Rob Schneider. If Farrell didnt at least give Rob a call, asking for his blessing, then Farrell is an ass. I wonder if this is Farrell, a super liberal, trying to diss Rob who is a conservative.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stan</a>

ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaWHAT FULL MOVIES BEFORE CINEMAS AT: movie69.tk
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIf anyone could tell me the music at 1:35 I would appreciate it so much, Been trying to track it down for 30 minutes. PLEASE!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIts a really god movie, i&#39;ve already watch it :)
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful movie. 
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaAnd this is why I watch movies, such a powerful trailer that I can only imagine what the film provides. Hope to see this one day.  I really do. :)
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHannibal
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaLove Mikkelsen!!!!!! Amazing and charming actor! :]
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI just want to know the music that starts at the first minute!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI can recommend this movie for every fan of cinema. I haven&#39;t seen such an intense movie with such great actors in a long time. Just don&#39;t bother the subtitles, it&#39;s worth the reading!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaMads got an award for best actor for this film. I&#39;m still waiting to watch this
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitawhats the music in this trailer called?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll take it!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaWow very intense!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaThis danish film looks like it will be really good
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaintense trailer ;o
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie will scare the shit out of a lot of prospective male teachers! It&#39;s frightening to think that a child&#39;s little white lie can be so utterly destructive - but such is the climate of fear that we live in today. Climate of fear? Watch /watch?v=B0LLWS2DEeU here on YouTube if you don&#39;t believe me. Anyway, I&#39;m a big Mads fan. Such an amazing actor. And yeah, his face is totally badass! XD
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaspoiler: hannibal kills the little girl and eats her...with fava beans &amp; chianti....sssss...
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHey! It&#39;s Hannibal!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaAt first I tought Dwayne &#39;&#39;The Rock&#39;&#39; Johnson high as fuck with hair, glasses and all skiny plus speaking other language. :D
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaLe Chifre!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaAhahaha
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaModern day witch hunts, that&#39;s what it always turns into as soon as there is even a chance of a child being molested. Of course it is a sick crime that affects a child for the rest of their lives, but we have to find a better more effective way of dealing with it that does not ruin the lives of the innocent
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer that pretty much all but has the last scene of the movie in it. Good job marketing!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaKids lie all the damn time.  about everything.  Unfortunately, society sometimes jumps to conclusions because there are perverts out there :(  
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHannibal
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaSo this is a prequel to Nightmare on Elm Street, right? 
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaLucas looks like my teacher in my school..

ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit Mads Mikkelsens danish is blurry
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaFucking people.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaBlack Water. A dutch movie. Charlize Theron is producing a USA remake.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaLooper SPOILERS had a six year old villain  SPOILERSSSS
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t remember the last movie where the villain was a 5-6 year old girl, even if unwittingly so.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song in the background about half way through and at the end?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaGuaranteed they probably kill the guy and then find out he never touched the girl.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI saw this film .. so amazing 
I recommend people to watch it :)
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this movie today in the evening and it was really some amazing piece of art. Such an impeccable movie .. 
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHe plays the role of the scar face villain in casino royale. Good actor!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitame 2!!

ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaXD hehe 
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaThis dude is a great actor!!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHe is in the Hannibal tv show and the antagonist in Casino Royal.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaMan that movie was released ages ago in Europe. However, you should definitely check it out, great performance by Mads in this witch hunt movie.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitareally love the movie
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t that the guy who plays perseus mentor in clash of titans?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaBest movie of 2012!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaso has he been accused of being a pedo?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaYes, Mads Mikkelsen. Great actor.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitathis actually looks like a pretty fucking good movie.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch this
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaYes.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitafor me he will always be Le Chiffre
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaYeah.

ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitagood actor
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitawas that a reference to one of my favourite movies of all times: A royal affair?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie last month. It was more scary than any horror movie...
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHe still scares me because of his face on Hannibal
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaomg, his face is badass!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s a man! :D like me! Fallus!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitagreatings to strauss-kahn, kachelmann, gustl molat and assange!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitahope he&#39;ll go Hannibal on them XD
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitayes fire balls hitting
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHis Danish! :D like me! Denmark!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHA punny
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about this guy Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) who works at a kindergarten, and gets accused of being paedophile. Even though he ain&#39;t, and nothing is proven, the whole town he lives in turns against him. Overall it&#39;s a movie about how rumours spread in a smalltown community... Dang, it&#39;s great movie!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitai think this film takes place in hell
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaMakes me proud to be countryman with that guy. Seen all his movies, such an great actor. One of the few people who can play every single role, the bad guy, good guy. You know what I mean. Such an inspiring guy :)
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitawhats it about?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaDude, I&#39;ve seen all of Mads movies but today most people will know him from tv series- Hannibal :)
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaGrrrrreat movie!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI just can&#39;t watch films like this, they make me so angry and sad at the same time
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitawell, way to give away the ending.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaI wish this trailer didn&#39;t tell us he was innocent, it would&#39;ve been way more riveting 
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIndie movies are allowed to be popular.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitayou obviousely haven&#39;t seen &quot;De gr√∏nne slagtere&quot; and &quot;Adams √¶bler&quot;
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaGood danish movie.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, Hannibal is the best :D
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s weird that they call it an indie movie when it was pretty huge in Denmark. Or it is just that missed something here?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaOne Eye is accused of child molestation???
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitawhat language they speaks?
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaHannibal!
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaits Hannibal.
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaThat looks awesome!!!! :0
ieLIOBkMgAQdelimeterByIshitaTony : Pusher 1 &amp; 2

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@nube1oscuras the music is just standard trailer music composed by one of those instrumental music bands, like Two Steps from Hell, Immediate Music, etc.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitakick ass

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaSeriously...I&#39;m thinking Gosick...
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI love how Robert Downey Jr plays Sherlock Holmes! He looks so hot shirtless! :D and his british accent &lt;3 I LOVE HIM! &lt;3
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita&quot;only on itunes trailers&quot;.... or youtube lol
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;d have loved to see Stephen Fry in this, but one can&#39;t have everything. Awesome overall.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaEpic
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaROBERTS MINE &lt;3
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitawhy oh why is rachel mcadams not the one to play the female lead??
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitathink robert downey jr is one of the only Americans to put on a convincing British accent...
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaseing this makes you thing that Iron man is a kind of joke...
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaLol &quot;I&#39;m on my HONEYMOON!&quot; Watson seems a tad upset.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaYEAH! All back together!! And Jared Harris as Moriarty!! If i spelled it wrong means I am excited!!!! Yeah Robert Downey Jr. and soon to be a father in February 2012!! YEAH!!! All goes well.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI love Robert Downey Jr &lt;3
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI CAAANT WAIIT FOR THIS ONE ;)
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaRobert downey Jr is the best iron man well the only i think but still wouldnt be the same without him and he plays the best Sherlock 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaRober Downey Jr is a genius when it comes down to acting, i havnt seen  a movie of his that i didnt love!

cant wait to see this move! :D
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Cavelcade I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anyone&#39;s fault, and exasperation doesn&#39;t equal no respect. I am often exasperated at my best friend but there is no one else I respect more. So I hardly see Watson&#39;s &quot;exasperation&quot; at Holmes as a meaning of him not giving a huge respect to Holmes. You don&#39;t have to be all nice and kind and gentle to respect someone. And anyways, if someone&#39;s trying to interrupt your love life/marriage, you would be exasperated too, but that isn&#39;t the same as no respect.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@BetaArtemis They work in tune, but (to be fair, this is probably either Jude Law or the director&#39;s fault) Watson seems to be exasperated with Holmes throughout. While this certainly occasionally happened, it was always for a very brief period and was very rare. I&#39;d forgotten what had annoyed me more though, which is the character they seem to be giving Moriarty, even in the first movie. He&#39;d never have met Irene in a carriage, he&#39;d have had a lackey do it. I&#39;m still going to see this, though.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Cavelcade I still don&#39;t see how this one short trailer showed that Holmes didn&#39;t respect Watson or Watson didn&#39;t respect Holmes, just because they are yelling or bickering doesn&#39;t mean there is no trust or respect. A trailer isn&#39;t everything and just because they didn&#39;t show those &quot;respect&quot; scenes doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t any. As far as I&#39;m concerned, I have no reason to believe why there isn&#39;t respect, they seem to be working in tune just fine. 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@BetaArtemis Because above all things, Watson has huge respect for Sherlock Holmes at that stage in their relationship. Certainly at the beginning he was a skeptic but, as their relationship progressed, that&#39;s one of the primary feelings that he brings across. The fact is, in this trailer I get no sense of respect. Holmes certainly has a good deal of respect for Watson too, though he&#39;s less inclined to show it and in this trailer, again, I get little sense of the respect for his side, either.

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitai like this but the best sherlock was and always be jeremy brett.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@BetaArtemis I&#39;ve watched the old Sherlock Holmes, and I assure you, Holmes is no old man in them(unless your old man is someone slightly older than R.D.J. Jeremy Brett is the best Sherlock Holmes, btw. Even if the duo was good in this film(in your opinion) the movie still sucks. Sherlock Holmes been made into action movie, a really boring and dump one too, if this is anything like the first film.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Cavelcade I don&#39;t see what is wrong with Holmes and Watson&#39;s relationship from just a short trailer, if anything, I find it even more interesting. The movies have made them into a dynamic, smart and, quickly adaptive fighting duo, the way Holmes and Watson should be, not the way those old films and TV shows have made them to be. This trailer only made me more excited to see them back on screen. It&#39;s high time Holmes shed the old view that those old films/TVs have made people believe.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Greensery The only ones that ruined Holmes was those old classics that made generations think that Sherlock Holmes was only some old dude who smokes. If anything, this movie&#39;s made Holmes better.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Dallasdeckard Holmes could always fight as well as he could think, this movie hasn&#39;t taken away from his genius and has only showed more of his fighting skills that the books have always alluded to and the old classics have never been able or bother to show.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@BetaArtemis I&#39;d agree somewhat about the first movie, but it seems as if they&#39;ve gotten the Watson-Holmes relationship completely wrong for this one. I&#39;m waiting to see what happens but I&#39;ll be disappointed if they have. Also if they give Holmes a love interest, that would be poor. So far this trailer has left me unimpressed, but the last movie still makes me want to go see it.

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitawow amazing
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitathe slow-mos look amazing!
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaONLY!... on iTunes Trailers!

*sees trailer*
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@ZojakDave Hence is why he makes an excellent Tony Stark. 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaSherlock from Doyle&#39;s books and Sherlock from this film are very different from each other, but I love their both. :)
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaumm... he said only on itunes trailers... sooo.. why am i seeing it here? 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaLIKE A BOSS
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaand all thanks to elton john.......
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI mean I doubt it is accurate, but it&#39;s still a pretty good series.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitahaha anyone else notice the Tony Stark goatee goin? lol
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaDoyle is spinning in his grave. Cerebral Holmes turned into a Victorian Rambo. Hollywood has no shame.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaAt least there&#39;s some Holmes/Watson slashy
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaSo they&#39;re ruining Holmes yet again
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaAgreed Artemis, you obviously didn&#39;t read much Holmes Wadser.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaHope Holmes doesn&#39;t take drug-testing on the Gladstone, the dog, to the next level &gt;.&lt;&quot;
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@onceafteratime she is part of the cast
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaget that out of my face .. it isn&#39;t in ur face it is in my hand .. get what in ur hand out of my face .. oh boys will still boys 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t remember there being fight scenes in the books.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@BetaArtemis I agree, this is a great adaption.

&quot;Holmes is smart, genius, unconventional, and Watson is sharp, skilled, and no bumbling idiot. This is the true Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.&quot; - BetaArtemis

You rock
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaAh C&#39;mon! I wish Rachael Mcadams was in this!

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitawish the female actress is a different one.  
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@silver911surfer As a hardcore Sherlock Holmes fan, this adaptation is so much more faithful and better than most of the old movies and TV shows. They did not &quot;fuck the image up of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, if anything, they prove that they know how to stay true to the essence and spirit of the characters, as well as having fun with the action. Holmes is smart, genius, unconventional, and Watson is sharp, skilled, and no bumbling idiot. This is the true Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m on my HONEYMOON!
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaWOW WHAT A WAY TO FUCK THE IMAGE UP OF SHERLOCK HOMES, This is  they type of movie they give to a legend really???????? They slow motion park look lame as fuck to who agrees? 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitahahahaha I love this, I would watch all the sequels  
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaliked the BBC reboot better

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaah ! Sherlock Holmes is gay xD
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@Jacob6443 doubt it, sherlock would have to be at least 60 if it&#39;s in 1914... maybe one of the south african wars?
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshita@brotherlylovely One of my favorite exchanges!

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaThis movie will be awsome!!! I went giddy with the reference from the first movie...
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaRDJ, Jude Law and Noomi  AWSOME 
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaLol the last part. &quot;Get what&#39;s in your hand out of my face&quot;. Didn&#39;t they repeat that from the first movie? Except the roles are reversed
DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaHeavy artillery plus machine guns and British soldiers. Takes place in world war one?

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaoh I like Sherlock Holmes, from the decade that began with a study in scarlet, this version is great. a very free version but pretty good, Robert Downey Jr. are the best

DpxtbtnC1u8delimeterByIshitaIs Rachel McAdams even in this movie? 
It doesn&#39;t even matter, I love Noomi.

yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaReminder. There were plays, music, money, football, painting, clean new cothing, and advanced sanitation services at the &quot;death camps.&quot;
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaMUH 6 MILLION SHOES
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaIf you can be arrested for saying something in a country then chances are what is being said is 100% true.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaDavid Irving did nothing wrong.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita&#39;to learn who rules over you, simply ask who you are not allowed to criticize.&#39;
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaYeah, let&#39;s vilify and attempt to murder a man who dared to question our version of events.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaHey Black lives matter watch this!!! You could learn a thing or two from the masters and originators of the grievance industry.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThe truth does not fear investigation. Surely upon further review the narrative would only be further proven right?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaO VEY
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaOY VEY, BRITAIN IS TRYING TO LEAVE OUR ONE WORLD NATION? LET&#39;S PUT OUT ANUDDA SHOAH(TM) MOVIE TO DISTRACT &#39;EM!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaSo, a movie about not falsifying the truth falsifies the statements and sheer amount of academic work put forth by Mr. Irving? Thanks, Jews!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita6,000,000<br><br><b>Mic drop</b>
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAll these fake likes, everyone is calling you out on your bullshit lies in the comments. When will you Steins learn?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaLot of unpleasant anti-semitism in the comments here. Let&#39;s hope when this trailer starts being watched by people other than denialists it might get some more positive comments being made.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaTo learn who rules over you find out who you can&#39;t CRITICISE = ZIONIST JEWS our  masters.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaReading these comments, I never knew how anti semitic and down right racist people still are.  It&#39;s devastating
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThis is Evalion&#39;s movie
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaTimothy Spall is an amazing actor, he&#39;s been so underrated
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaA movie like this is just frustratingly pointless, if anything it empowers the lunatics that deny the Holocaust.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaDid people say &quot;lawyered up&quot; in 1994?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAgain a movie about the Holocaust... ? People may have been intrigued in the 90s, today, it will bomb big time, especially with those actors (although I guess it didn&#39;t cost much). &quot;Not all opinions are equal&quot; =&gt; thank you, liberals, for showing your true colors.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThen the LORD said to Cain, &quot;Where is your brother Abel?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he replied. &quot;Am I my brother&#39;s keeper?&quot; The LORD said, &quot;What have you done? Listen! Your brother&#39;s blood cries out to me from the ground. <br><br>The Book of Genesis 4: 9
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaGotta keep those billions in sham reparations payed to Israel somehow, right guys?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaaw
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaOK, now do this about the moon landing.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar goes to...
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI wonder if Mr Irving will get a fair trial this time around...
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaand they said Hollwood wont cast her anymore! right
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitait is so crazy that there are actually people who think holocaust did not happen. elvis though, he ist still alive, I strongly believe that. he faked his death to continue a life in peace. he did love his fans, but after all, he needed peace, and not all those fanatics and the papparazzi.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaIn a New Media Age this theme¬†seems quite relevant.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaterrible premise for a movie.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita&quot;Some events do take place but are not true; others are‚Äîalthough they never occurred.&quot;<br>-Elie Wiesel
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaFunny how really smart people are anti-Semites . Henry Ford, Dr. David Duke, Dr. William pierce, Mel Gibson, Bobbi Fischer, Jesus, David Irving, Adolf Hitler, Charles Lindbergh, ....Kicked out 109 times, and still hated no matter how much propaganda they put out.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI came here because Rachel Weisz  was looking attractive in that thumbnail
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI was gassed three times that I can remember. I only survived because I could hold my breath for 20 minutes at a time. Then I played dead when the guards cleaned out the bodies. They caught me two times but on the third time, I managed to run off into the woods where I lived for several years with no food or water. <br><br>It was the Martians from Area 51 who found me, and dropped me off on Fifth Avenue where I started a jewelry store and became a millionaire in three years. I can remember all this very well. It was like a miracle.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThis is such an inspirational film. I myself am the grandson of victims of the Shoah, so this really hits close to home.<br>My grandfather once told me the story of when he went to a German shop following the war and came across a bar of soap labeled &quot;RJF&quot; (pure Jewish fat)--for all he knew, that could have been his brother sitting their on the shelf. He ended up purchasing it and giving it a proper burial.<br>NEVER AGAIN!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaare these Jews going to mention prof. dr.¬† Dariusz Ratayczak that was murdered 2010 for questioning that holy hollohoax of theirs? I don&#39;t think so. Persecution of Ernst Zuendel? Beating of prof dr Robert Faurisson? How many people are incarcerated just now for tryng to¬†delve out the truth?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThere will always be people denying the obvious truth, until truth hits them in the face... With a chair.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing - cannot wait to see it. Such an important issue and highlighting a kick ass woman fighting anti-Semitism. (Of course will have to break my long-term Ms. Weisz boycott - refused to see her movies after she stole Daniel Craig away from the rest of us .....)
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaewe pettigrew
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaIn 2006, when he was in Austria, David Irving was sentenced to jail for having revised history.<br><br>Most european countries have laws where it is forbbiden to question the holocaust. Why such a law ?<br><br>Truth does not fear investigation.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita3 people will actually go see this BS in a theatre
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaOne telling line from the trailer is: &quot;We know what it is, it&#39;s how we prove what it is.&quot; Until you have proof, the knowledge is low grade and open to challenge - and if your only question is &quot;how we prove it&quot; you are not starting off with an open mind and that it liable to bias your conclusions.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAnother western propaganda movie üòõ
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita&quot;true story&quot;
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaInto the Trash it goes....
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s a hollycawst?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI have a question... Germans who was born after the war, are guilty? Should we blame them? If not, WTF you people still spread this shit?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaDAAAAAAAMN Denial
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita&quot;Not all opinions are equal&quot;... Finally! Someone says it out loud.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaDavid Irving has put forth some interesting evidence.  I suggest everyone looks at his findings and decide for themselves.  No much use denying that camps existed though.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaTrying to find this movie where a little girls mother becomes a nun and <br>leaves on a boat.Gives her a bible.the girl throws it in the sea.Climbs a<br> mountain curses god.Sees devil on the tree.Something set around prince <br>charles of spain.She has few sisters too.Saw it here on youtube but cant<br> remember its name.If anyone can help me out.Thanks. :)
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaOh, the &quot;brands&quot; should be advertised to not become forgotten... I think the nazi Germany has done more for the jews than every single being or nation combined together. They have created a flag for you to carry and get free &quot;candies&quot; everywhere... Of course it was inhumanly hellish and I would not wish that even for my enemy, but that is what created your alibi through the modern reality.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaVery interesting trailer, I see go see it.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThe truth is a defense against libel :)
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaMiss me?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaWhat is that guy who says &quot;Yeh, not in the UK&quot; name?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaOkay, this could be an interesting movie since what its based on is truly interesting. <br>I do hope, that the message will not only be onesided (propganda for western democracy) as a story such as this is VERY easily to end up like that. I want a movie with a more objective point of view representing two sides and letting me choose (as the viewer) one without one of the sides being potrayed as the true, good, one.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita&quot;History is written by the victors&quot;<br><br>Thus can history be subject to distortion of the truth.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaWormtail, go home. You&#39;re drunk.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitawhy would he even lie about that shit?
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI MISS ANDREW&#39;S IRISH ACCENT
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaDavid Irving is a legit world renowned WW2 Historian. One of the best and even Christopher Hitchens said so.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAward bait, but it looks pretty damn good
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaRachel Weisz...honestly, I would crawl 100 metres over broken glass just to hear her fart through a walkie talkie.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita...ain&#39;t just a river in Egypt.&quot;
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaSo, she&#39;s mad because he dinal the holocaust with proofs, but nobody can be mad with her even if she clearly denial the NATIVE AMERICAN GENOCIDE?!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitathis looks like an oscar movie though !!!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitawat&#39;s this?üòï
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaRachel`s American accent is a bit dodgy.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaHolocust movie? Rachel wants that second Oscar!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitahmm this actually looks interesting
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaStraight Outta /b/
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaholy shit. this looks great. even with rachel weisz pulling a sarah paulson
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI never knew people denied the existence of the Holocaust, I have lived in Germany and Britain and in both places it is drilled into our heads to teach us to remember.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaGod, I would love to be Rachel Weisz boytoy. Spank me you highness!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitawhen does this movie come out??!
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaAn interesting entry for Hollywood in regards WW2; keeping track of history - regardless of how it makes us or iur enemies look - is vital.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitathat guy at the beginning looks like the rat from harry potter
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaMeh
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaanti-evalion
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaNazis vs Feminazis.....
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI thought it was going to be about that river flowing through the dusty land.Ôªø
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaRachel Weisz I will always love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThe sexual tension between those two is unbearable.

yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaRachel Weisz is awesome, another Oscar??? Maybe.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaLove Rachel Weisz though. So good in The Lobster
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaI could&#39;ve ended this debate in the first 3 seconds of it. &quot;No need for the rest of this movie, we&#39;ve got the diary&quot;
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is like a flame war over a shitpost. I could have sworn I&#39;ve seen this exact argument about the holocaust on tumblr. But this movie looks good.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitawhat about what&#39;s happening for palestinians now?<br>&quot;like something didn&#39;t happen&quot;.. <br>there&#39;s some issues needed to be resolve then.
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshita224 VIEWS WOW
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaThe presumption of innocence is for criminal proceedings, but it&#39;s true that the burden of proof should be on the dude
yH7ktvUWaYodelimeterByIshitaFirst like
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaanyone knows whats the music?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitayo its probaly his dad yo¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaOoooh, this looks good. So glad to see the release date is so close!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitasounds like a movie similar to fight club
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitabig fan of jake loved prisoners !
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitatoo much sepia.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitadont let it be a spilt personality thingy...
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaJakeeee
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaOMG ¬† I am so excited
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathe colour tone in this movie is so yellow..
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting trailer for sure,
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaGyllenhall is always in great films, cant wait to see this!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaVery good trailer, plot is intriguing¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaMy first thought would be a long-lost twin, but a doppelganger is obviously the most logical answer.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis is how trailers should be - not giving too much, just enough to keep people thinking.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaIf it plays that Schizophrenia cliche crap I&#39;m going to be pretty disappointed.¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaHopefully that is not his split personality... :/
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaOh heeeeeeeeeeeellllllllll yes!!!!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaJake is perfect!!!!!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI recognize the picture Google came up with at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJuaAWrgoUY&amp;t=0m29s">0:29</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJuaAWrgoUY&amp;t=0m31s">0:31</a>! It&#39;s Jake Gyllenhaal! :D<br>Jake was amazing in &#39;Prisoners&#39;, I can&#39;t wait to see this. Seriously can&#39;t wait.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t this a Twilight Zone episode?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaBased on the book &quot;The Double&quot;, by Jos√© Saramago. And since we&#39;re talking about Saramago, I&#39;d like to recommend &quot;Blindness&quot;, both book and film. Next, &quot;Death With Interruptions&quot;, by Quentin Tarantino (it&#39;s be crazy).
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaDo normal people react this way when they find out there is someone that looks exactly like them out there? Personally, I&#39;d just keep going about my business and not give it another thought or I&#39;d be like &quot;Hey, that guy could be my twin brother. I&#39;ll sen him an e-mail and see if he wants to meet up.&quot;
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI have a bad feeling about this movie¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitalike it.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaWhaaaaa.....?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJuaAWrgoUY&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a>¬†<br>Is this an alien movie?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone explain the trailer to me?¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaDid I see a demon with horns growing out of his nose somewhere in this trailer?!?!üòï
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of &quot;Prisoners&quot; + starring Jake¬†Gyllenhaal.<br>This has to be goooood
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaFight Club much. That is all
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitahe is crazy and he created a second personality it&#39;s obvious
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaHe rides a suzuki. This might be my two favorite things ever.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaBORING!!!!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaan adaptation of &quot;El hombre duplicado&quot; by Jose Saramago done by the director of Prisoners? nice...
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaFinally Jared Leto and Jake Gyllenhaal in the same movie! :P
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal movie.ok where to book tickets
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaKai filmi chanss

FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaJake is so hot<br>i can&#39;t

FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaBitch be like, 2 is better than 1.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitahooooooooooooo............... ¬†same guy trick again huh

FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitacrazy..
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaAt first glance Gyllenhaal looks like Joel from The Last of Us
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaLooks very good ...but ...I wish it wasn&#39;t so yellow to be honest
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaso like Black Swan with a guy?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaLol, holly woods officially run out of good ideas
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaholyshit Jake looks like a sexy version Zach Galifianakis in here¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathis looks freaking amazing. all the thrillers that have come out over the past couple years have been unadulterated crap. but this looks awesome. i am actually excited to see this, and more excited to see jake gylenhall steal the show!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI love him , he&#39;s such a great actor 
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitagonna be so confusing.¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThe lion of Persia!!1 Just gonna watch it because of that guy.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaIt does look pretty good actually. Way to go Jake.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaim gonna guess both characters are himself, meaning that he is delusional or has dissociative identity disorder
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis guy is always awesome in every movie he&#39;s in. I&#39;m excited for this movie for the sole reason Gyllenhaal is in here. What a talent!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaWow that was really unsettling
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaJust give him the oscar now.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaMan Prisoners was great and he was damn good in that movie.. can&#39;t wait for this lol
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaLook this film up in Wikipedia.  Its an adaptation from the book called The Double. One jake an &quot;original&quot; the other is a &quot;copy&quot;. One was &quot;born&quot; before the other. 
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI think he may have multiple personalities ? Either that or he&#39;s an alien or sumfink ?!?!,
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaFight club ?
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis better not be another, &quot;Its just all in your head&quot; thing...
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaWTF?! This film is going to be awesome!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaprisoners was really good hope this is better
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome, time to buy a motorcycle now xD
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitanice one
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaMaybe split personality? 
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaDonnie Darko in the alternate universe of source code using the sands of time.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI would imagine with special fx being what they are now they could do some mind bending things with this premise. It will be interesting to see if they break any new ground in that area.¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaGritty version of Double Impact
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathis looks epic
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitai have a feeling that one of them is a clone or maybe he is a time traveler either way it looks like a good movie¬†
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis got me hooked! Looking forward to seeing
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaDifferent dimensional travel!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaTime travel movie, DUUUUUHHH!!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathis looks geuuuud
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitamaybe another Fight Club kind of stunt...He&#39;s just going insane with multiple personality disorder.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t Jesse Eisenberg doing a doppelganger film, too?<br>(insert Lex Luthor comment here)
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathe trailer reminds me of Ken Folletts &quot; The Third Twin&quot; a really good book.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaFight Club feelings...
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaKinda ironic how I had &#39;duplicates not allowed for this playlist&#39; stuck on my screen the whole time.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI am very intrigued!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaWhoops! Someone spilt their coffee on the memory card!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis guy&#39;s film trailers are always great, but the films don&#39;t quite live up to the hype. When I first saw the trailer for prisoners I thought it would be better than it was. It was by no means a bad film, but I expected it to be more elaborate for some reason. But this does look interesting, lets see how this turns out
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaScore seems awesome.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitamindfuck.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m calling it, It&#39;s Clones!
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitathis looks sick! loved Prisoners. i&#39;m seeing this.
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshita2 Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s?<br>thats all i ever wanted
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaI dislike clips where I don&#39;t have any idea what the movie is about
FJuaAWrgoUYdelimeterByIshitaO_o donnie darko the adult years. ¬† It just got real.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaA life of Crime boils down too, being rich or sleeping well..
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitadis is ma fav trailer ever...
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaHard to believe it&#39;s been ten years since this film was released!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaBest gangster movie i have ever watched after Godfather and A bronx tale
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaOn the extended version I hear a cockney accent in the background around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> mark when they are running through Frank&#39;s weekly schedule... Anyone else hear this? I&#39;m thinking it could be a crew member?!?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitasome movies never get too old to watch # 2017

BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> well, thats where you wrong kiddo
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s such a great actor.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaDenzel is great
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitawhen I first saw this movie I thought it was great but then 2 years passed and Mafia 3 came out, I played that game and realized how good American Gangster truly was. I think what that movie needed was music from the 60&#39;s like Mafia 3 had to set that black southern sound/mood. American Gangster was like modern rap and it didn&#39;t sound like that place existed like in Mafia 3. Anyways, I play Mafia 3 soundtrack when I watch American Gangster now
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWas expecting the american gangster from west linn oregon, chael p sonnen to make a cameo lol jks
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie! Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are AMAZING in this!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaSo far still the best gangster movie in this decade i think
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaif u like crowe and Denzel going head to head in this movie ,try watching virtuosity as well imo a good movie,its scifi but good action movie with those 2 together,not many have seen this movie i grew up watching that movie and still a fave.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaboring movie !!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a long movie!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWhere you at thou
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThey should make at least a second part.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWHERE ARE THE FUCKING FACE HUGGERS AND XENOS? OPPS...WRONG MOVIE
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie had a few good scenes, but overall it was corny as fuck. I don&#39;t know if earlier gangster flicks were just too good for anything else to come close or what. But Denzel is still the shit.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best Gangsta mover ever !
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaDenzel Washington is fucking Legend :D
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitais this good?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitastill groovy happy birthday Denzel Washington
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThey should have based Mafia III  on this movie.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitathis trailer is very shoddy compared to the overall movie. Great movie btw
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita1aaaaaaaaa
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaRussell Crowe will still always be Sid 6.7 to me LOL
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaSong <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a>???
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaJust like there is a quite normal <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> exaggeration tendency to estimate revenues of LCN the same should be said about other ethnic gangster organizations. They never really got revenues as been claimed. Those still believing myths of &quot;mafia power and wealthy&quot; should read scientific Italian study about organized crime made by Transcrime. And Michael Franzese was pretty right when suggesting that huge majority of gangsters have very limited ability to earn money. They are too stupid.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaT.i is a great rapper but he is seriously really bad as an actor.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaIn Virtuosity, Russell was bad and Denzel was good. In American Gangster, Denzel was bad and Russell was good. Coincidence?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=0m45s">0:45</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV_nssS6Zkg&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> wasnt in the movie
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaSong?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita1st rule of mafia/gangster movies, get Joe Pesci.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitatrailer much better then the movie
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitawhat song is in the background?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should have been directed by Martin Scorsese. The story has a lot of potential but Ridley scot isn&#39;t that good in gangster movies. Anything besides historical movies is not for Ridley. Scorsese would have made this story a Masterpiece movie.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis is a true gangster movie, now pull up your pants

BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita<b>The movie which Micheal Mann should of made.</b>
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitasong name is   &quot;Jay-z - Heart of a City&quot;
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaBlade Brown - Drug Dealer should have been the soundtrack to the closing scene in this movie..

BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitafoda.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaUhm good movie, but it glamorized Frank Lucas too much. He was almost a really likeable character here. More likeable than Richie Roberts. The real Frank Lucas was an illiterate thug. Far from the gent that Denzel was in the movie.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll brake ya fuckin legs. 
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThey tried to kill..<br><br>MY WIFFFFFFFEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitathis is A MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRICA
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaMaybe I am the only person on earth who thinks this movie is a boring piece of sh*t, only the last 30 minuten were ok.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaHands down the best film ever made!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaAmerican gangster, New Zealander police
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis was the first trailer which actually made me watch the movie after not wanting to do so.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitagreat trailer, i havent seen such good trailer in a¬†long time
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that last song i love it
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaHis arms when he said &quot;they tried to kill MY WIFE&quot; LOLOLOLOL 
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita???????
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaLol everyone thinks that Denzel Washington is the best actor...<br>Now even though this movie isnt so great in my opinion,im starting to think like he is really good.<br>He is in my top 10 for sure now
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitai think denzel washington is not for that character
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshita10/10
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Gangster and Alpha Dog = Best movies ever!
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaWhat is name songs?
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitabest Riddley Scott&#39;s film and best realistic film ever (at least for me)
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie and Denzel killed it. Not like he ever doesn&#39;t but still. He was perfect in this.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitai love DENZEL, this is one of my favorite movies
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaI love gangster movie!!
I love more, if its a true story!!
&quot;My man&quot;
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is much better than Prometheus.
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s only 5 or 6 years old and is already considered a classic. 
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitathey can make a movie about denzel throwing papers in a bucket and i still watch it
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitadreamfilm.se ! But that is with Swedish subtitles
BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitai need a full movie, please...

BV_nssS6ZkgdelimeterByIshitaBEST MOVIE EVER!!!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m guessing the human race is gonna make  a bad mistake to the aliens 
&amp; eventually the aliens are going to fight back.the aliens did&#39;nt mean to land on earth but how cruel the human race is disrespecting the aliens then we&#39;re screwed fucking human race.anyways i smell a box office hit or maybe an oscar
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI really REALLY want to see this movie !
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitabut the cockroach alien looks like such a nice guy! :P
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaChill, it&#39;s a movie dude.  Also, if you were an alien and you wanted to enslave the human race and use all the natural resources, would you let your intentions be known?  Of course you&#39;ll say you mean us no harm.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahaha
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathe alien guy in the end made me want to watch the movie, otherwise the trailer is pretty ineffective (at least for me)
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a brilliant film.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI heard it was being canceled because it cost to much money to make. I know they started it but never really got any where else. I REALLY hope they finish it. I&#39;m waiting for it.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai just dont know what the prob is
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshita@kev4naru

he&#39;s the choice but still not signed for the halo movie
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitabut.... the president is black! 0_o
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshita....i feel that ur an idiot
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaur anti american arn&#39;t you?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai really want to see this! i have have a feeling that when the aliens are &quot;let go&quot; they&#39;ll just open up on what im guessing is south africa
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaman,I feel sorry for them.The US is great,but it is run by dumbshits.I gues it&#39;s human nature to be brutal and unforgiving.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaof course our government would be stupid enough to interrogate an alien.........
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaupdate from last comment:If the WORLD GOVERNMENTS in this movie DO turn out to be the bad guys in this movie I WON&#39;T BE SURPRISED,and it&#39;ll be disappointing(not the move) i speak of course of First impressions made by THE HUMANS! WHO I SUSPECT ARE DUMBSHITS IN THIS MOVIE FOR NOT LETTING THE ALIENS GO HOME!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawow,looks good,just proves how BRUTAL the goverment is.If they had found out about E.T he&#39;d be dead and they would&#39;ve ended the movie differently,and it&#39;s stupid,just like in &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; BUT if the aliens of this movie are really evil and are just tricking the local government,then i will definitely change my mind about this movie.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThis is movie is now officially on my &quot;must see&quot; movie list.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitayou know its just a movie right? just checking...  :  )
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitadamn what must you look like then? 
i was only kiddin m8 :) no hard feelings?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaMy girlfriend thinks the Alien is cute..
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaHorrible movie.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaYea, well in the movie the human race is holding their entire species prisoner. And we&#39;ve commandeered their mother ship. So yea, I think he ,may be a little frighted of the Human interrogator.

CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT!!!!
 IN THEATERS AUGUST 14th.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitayes and frankly...i was rather dissapointed
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaSWEET....  they&#39;re really coming in peace this time, huh?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaReally? So are you asking if this movie is a Halo movie or you want one to be made because this is a totally different concept than Halo.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitano the aliens from halo arent pussys &quot; we jsut wanna go home =[&quot; pussys &gt;=[ i hate pussy alieins
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahopefully. lmfao.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshita...is this an SA flick?! hectic... bigups...
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathe space ship from &quot;Independence Day&quot; movie????
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawow giant bug is the alien so stupid and look it is just like that alien m=from amrs thing when they said they men no harm then  kill people
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitain real life they would call the aliens terrist send them all to guantalimo bay and steal there ship and technology
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaHE JUST WANTS TO GO HOME!!!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitalol you probably did...watch it really be like that
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahow do u know
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaAWW! Thats f*cking depressing!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI feel sad now :&#39;(
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaNot really lol the short film is available on youtube, so the spoiler alert is a few YEARS old ;)
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathe alien look sad
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaawesome.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaLike to describe this movie for you all. It&#39;s about the prejudice and containment of an alien race. They were just refugees. So if any meatheads start posting, oh waah, there&#39;s no action! Keep in mind, it&#39;s a movie about morals.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathey just gtfo... gtfo...
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawhat a pitty
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitayay!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThe Halo movie has been discarded.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaIts Transformers Watch the show it has lots of explotions!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitayeah really and show how fucked up humans really are...
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaim preety sure they are going to kill 1 and bring it to scientist and then the aliens find out and make war.  lol
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI can say this is  a really interesting film just from the trailer since  hollywood has recycled the &quot;aliens come to earth, they are superior, they want to kill us, but we beat them with germs, water, computer viruses or just faith&quot; formula for two decades  we need new perspectives that can be exploited with today&#39;s special effects.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai feel bad for the poor guy =(
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThe humans want the aliens&#39; technology, that&#39;s my guess...
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai heard if this movie does good they will begin the halo film
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitano they are not.. humans are afraind of things that are more powerfull then them... its like god one day will decide to walk the earth... all the secret goverments will trie to contain Him...  and the rest of the world will be afraid... we fear what we dont contrl and dont understand (sorry for my english) xD
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s another film where government tries to take advantage of &#39;innocent&#39; aliens. Anyone remember E.T.?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitayou clearly missed the point. in this film WE are the monsters. I personally wouldnt mind living next door to an alien if he was friendly enough and could speak english.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahope so... halo movie is so far :(
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitamy guess is they are prisoners of the government, trying to steal alien tech., the aliens get pissed, then shit blows up, then its over. all within a 3 hour time span.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawell if its good i want it to be long...if its another king kong ill shoot myself
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaPeter Jackson? oh, you know it&#39;s gonna be more then 2hours long
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaaw, i cant wait
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahmm sometimes we can be really stupid
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathis seems liek a big misunderstanding.
lol
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks like a morality play similliar to the original day the earth stood still
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s nothing like The Day the Earth Stood Still. They were sent here to blow shit up. These aliens are refugees, now tell me, how is this the same?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaHMMMMMM from wat im seeing in the end of the movie the humans are going to do something fucking stupid when they alians want to go home apparently and were going to get into a war
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitacloverfield 2?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI am so gonna go see this movie. I hope its good though because Neill Blomkamp is also working on the Halo movie.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawhat format is this trailer to look so clear, even when HD isnt selected?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaYou just Blew my Fucking Mind
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitatrue of us all
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitait just got interesting... most scifi movies are about how Aliens hurt us... now (as far as the trailer) we are hurting them.
We as humans/ society hate everything... but what can we hate after we accept every human for who they are?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaYEA, your right. shit i think this is the whole moral of the movie.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaOMG guys, this is.... mega ironic, in the racist heart of South Africa, the Aliens are the &#39;new blacks&#39; as all communities want them to just go. 

o.O!! All the robot/alien movies this year are about humans causing destruction or creating something evil or being assholes.....makes me think that some directors are misanthropists, anyway the movies were great but i agree with half the stuff.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawho the hell thinks thats america its clearly south african not only from the huge slum area they showed but their accents as well, but i think this movie is gonna be brilliant the fact that its takes place in africa is a smart move by the writers cuz africa has so many problems of its own and this just piles something on that that government doesnt need to deal with and its just gonna be awesome im really excited to see it
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaPoor alien. You can see the emotion in it&#39;s eyes. I felt bad for it.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathats not america.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitadidnt ppl know? i cud easily tell by thier accents.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaits like role reversal- instead of the aliens being assholes we are being the assholes
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI hope this will turn into an apocalyptic movie, like I thought it was going to be. I&#39;ll see it regardless though. looks amazing.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahmm looks cool.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s what it looks like.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathe alien says they just want to go home, so maby home is earth and they have to kill all of us. I dont think that will happen in the movie, but i bet for them to get &quot;Home&quot; its a little more complicated than we think
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai hope not
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshita&quot;fuck you&quot; in alien translates into &quot;how can we go anywhere&quot;?

this movie is going to be awesome.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaI agree
I think they&#39;re overrated
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitai wouldnt say bad
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitathis 

A. going to be just like Cloverfield but with Aliens
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitawow this is gonna be a good movie and wow we are actually the bad guys in this whole senario
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitahaha aww...lol i feel sorry for the aliens. LET EM GO!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThat alien looked crappy as, I have seen better looking puppets...
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaim not really sure what this has to do with independence day. dystopia, alienation, military state, persecution? if you want to draw comparisons, bring out half-life and children of men.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaET Call Home!

Nooo... the roaming its expensive. xD
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaAlien Independence Nation Day 2: The ReMastered CGI Edition
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaThe face of the alien isn&#39;t pixelated, and it has subtitles. That appears to be the only differencee.
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely gonna watch this!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaindependence day ....2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaLet the damn aliens go home! Everyone gets homesick! Gawwd!!!
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitaDo you think its a thinly veiled social commentary?
DyLUwOcR5pkdelimeterByIshitalooks good
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhat is the last song that plays in the trailer all the way to the end?

yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaChristian,where is Anastasia?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaWait... Christian Grey was in this movie ?!? O.O
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaJust some fairy tales for the folks down there that we tell to help them feel safe. No one likes to be told that they were believing in phony leadership and it was time to crack some skulls because they just would not stop breaking everything and messing it up for the rest of us.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaShe was just fifteen  For heaven sake !!!
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaEveryone was a little too wild at 19, if i was ruling a country at that age everyone would have been screwed
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitamost stupid thing is a 18th century movie with modern music,just sucks
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<b>BEHEAD</b>
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie so much everything that comes with it. Poor them they weren&#39;t aware how much France was actually starving. This deserved all awards. Hands down to the actors. Well acted and I feel like this is the most budgeted historical movie.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the music of the trailer?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaInterestingly enough, although history portrayed her as evil/spoiled she was quite the contrary. The Austrian royal family at the time of empress Maria Theresa was, for it&#39;s time, very philanthropic that meant that Marie Antoinettes upbringing involved a lot of charity and caring for the poor, hence it being unlikely she every said &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;. Marie Antoinette also tried to push the king to reform and make him force the nobility and clergy to pay tax so that some of the weight could be lifted of the poor. It is true that she liked extravegance, but in many ways she was also trying her best to be a good queen and even tried to make the court a little more informal. She has just been prone to a lot of bad publicity and a good example of the &quot;Whenever it is going bad blame the foreigner&quot; mentality.t.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaJan, I think she did actually say let them eat cake. But I think through implication she was trying to suggest or pretend to those surrounding her, that she really believed what she said, and they played along with it. <br><br>But really,  they all knew full well, including Marie, the seriousness of the situation.<br><br>The situation was one of extreme bad news. <br>You have all these starving people at your gate because they have no bread. It‚Äôs terrible. And yes it‚Äôs a depressing scene not just for the starving poor but also for those who had to witness it. <br><br>We all know there are beggars on the street and they aren‚Äôt a cherry sight, are they. And neither was this dreadful spectacle. <br><br>Marie and her entourage were understandably trying to maintain the delicate delicious life, and by saying let them eat bread, which she did say, was actually an attempt to keep everyone including herself lifted up in this wonderfully uplifted mindset that they were used to living in. <br><br>They were used to living in this uplifted state of mind with an absence of all problems and she, by conveying the pretence, that she was blissfully unaware of the state of these starving people, was trying to keep her entourage in this lovely lifted mindset. <br><br>Those around her that were of nobility knew exactly what she was doing and probably appreciated it, however the less wise servants would have interpreted it very differently and seen it as either a callousness or an obliviousness to the state of her people. <br><br>Hence today her statement lives on in infamy with many believing she was a royal who was out of touch. No no no. Not out of touch. But not a very touching thing to say around servants with big ears who would misunderstand. <br><br>She is a splendid example of being so perfectly politically incorrect that her statement lives on today, 230 year later. <br><br>She would have lost her head anyway. That‚Äôs what starving people do. They blame the other guy who ain‚Äôt hungry. <br><br>If she left town on a fast horse she might have gotten away. Eventually that‚Äôs what she did but she left her run too late and instead went bravely to the scaffold. <br><br>The mob was taken back by her bravery but they wildly cheered as they severed the head from her delicate body. <br><br>‚ÄúAh the people, Aristotle. Be careful of them when their blood is up. They will cut your throat and cheer. Is it not therefore better to wear the disguise of a beggar than to be killed by them and spat upon. Be careful my dear Aristotle. ‚Äú
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaWhat was the last song playing?

yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI thought she was going to say, Hi, at the end there.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhy do they have american accents
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita10 years after Baz Luhrmann made &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in a modern twist,Sofia had her guideline.Both films want to appeal to a teen <a href="http://audience.giving/">audience.Giving</a> it acting and music that are totally relatable.Both were fine <a href="http://films.it/">films.It</a> peaks interest for younger people.Good stuff.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaEwww 50 shades guy...
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhy are there converse shoes and modern music in this movie
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based on all the propaganda concocted by the Bourgeoisie Slandering Her with their own debaucherous lifestyles.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZvsjPsyzjA&amp;t=183s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZvsjPsyzjA&amp;t=183s</a>
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaDon‚Äôt you Get IT!!! I‚Äôm Mrs Nesbitt!!!!
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaDid they really speak English then, or is this Hollywood fcking up history again
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song that starts playing when a woman is talking about mary sleeping with various men?? and the montage of said men lmao
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaShe had an affair... Poor Louis...
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaMusic is cool.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThe pug deserved more screen time
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI think i just saw christian grey
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWyKRoh98U&amp;t=0m15s">0:15</a> The horse-the way it walks...üòÇüòÇ
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWyKRoh98U&amp;t=2m11s">2:11</a> has this really happened? Or have they got the idea from the Anime Rose of Versailles.. idk but either way Iloved that scene
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaoh boy i need to watch this<br>can&#39;t believe i didnt see this before
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaLafayette would be proud
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita....she has an American accent.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI wish Kirsten Dunst did more movies when she was in her Bring It On days, she&#39;s something special
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThe most ugliest and dirty movie on Marie-Antoinette. A really disgrace.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert, she get her head chopped off
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitathis movie was so boooring !!
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaWhere is the translationüòï
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t with the American accents.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is a perfect mix of history and fantasy with one of the best soundtracks of any movie, anywhere. The attention to detail is to the 10th power yet Coppola does not take this project too seriously. (look closely for Converse sneakers in the Queen&#39;s closet.)
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaDID I SEE JAMIE DORAN
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie seriously doesn&#39;t get enough credit! Sofia Coppola and Kirsten Dunst make great works together.<br>Normally I prefer very accurate portrayals regarding historical movie adaptions (Major European history buff, I&#39;m Aussie though and haven&#39;t been to Europe yet, one day!!) but this is an exception. <br>I like and appreciate the colour palette and styles used, I feel that was accuracy for the time period in this regard.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaKinda hoped the Doctor showed up somewhere lmao
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaSo pretty
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI just finished The Rose Of Versailles which is an anime and Marie Antoinette plays a huge role in that anime once I saw the title of this video I got excited and I&#39;m for sure am going to try and watch it
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWyKRoh98U&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> Christian Grey what are you doing here?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaMonarchy is immoral. No one should have the right to use the people&#39;s tax money, just because they are born into a certain family.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaWas the queen ever beheaded ?? A question don&#39;t take it to seriously
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaAt the end she got her head off<br>Well I guess, I didn&#39;t see the movie
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaShe doesn&#39;t even try to fake an accent. XD
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch the movie but this trailer stopped me! it is horrible!
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaJoy Division in the background
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita&quot;this isn&#39;t too much, isn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;uhh.. no&quot;
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThey should&#39;ve let Tim Burton direct this film
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWyKRoh98U&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> Jamie Dornan
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaKirsten Dunst is so underrated.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI love this &lt;3
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest Soundtracks
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaKing Louis xvi is cute in this movie üò≥
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitathis is the movie that i&#39;ve been searching for but i didnt know the title and suddenly was on my recommendation
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s christian grey doing there
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was really good!
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaFilmed on licatio @ Versailles??
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaIf she could act she&#39;d be able to do a French accent the American accents ruined it for me
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t Marie gonna die at the end?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWyKRoh98U&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> <br>&quot; she looks like a  child &#39;&#39;<br>No shit  she&#39;s  14
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaNy film
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitagod imagine if this had been directed by Wes Anderson..
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitais this Lux?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaComo se llama la canci√≥n √∫ltima ??
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitathroughout history, people have given Marie Antoinette a lot of crap, but come on what do you expect from her? She¬†was just a teenager
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was based on an 800 page biography called &quot; Marie Antoinette: The Journey&quot; by Antoinia Fraser. It was VERY thorough and accurate and having READ THE BOOK I see why Sophia Coppola chose to use these actors and scenes to portray her. I suggest you sit down and read it before making a fool of yourself spouting opinions based on nothing but your own ignorance.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitathe soundtrack is unbelievable.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaalways has been and always will be my favorite movie &lt;3
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitado they include the part where she loses her head?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaThis film made me love Marie Antoinette
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite movies
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI wonder who decided she should have an american accent?
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI know everything put into this movie is not entirely nor historically correct and it wasn&#39;t meant to be. Coppola made this movie based on a writer&#39;s book on the portrayal of Marie Antoinette living this extravagant life behind the walls where poverty was at the time very serious. They even decided to put scenes that were only &quot;rumored&quot; to have happened in the papers that she supposedly did or say like &quot;let them eat cake&quot;. I love Coppola&#39;s eye and work in films ever since and I&#39;ve owned and watched all special features of production from this movie which made it even more insightful. Anyone watching this for the first time, appreciate the artistry and cinematography. Unless this was a documentary (which it isn&#39;t) than you may scrutinize the depiction of the characters portrayed. The last days of Marie Antoinette and her family is even more tragic.
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaIt is the worse biographical movie I have ever watch and my only wish is to be able to unwatch it,
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitaI love uuu Marie Antoinette.....and I love the movie tooüçÉ‚ù§Ôªø
yBWyKRoh98UdelimeterByIshitainteresting how a period style film has a trailer in format with a teen flick? not seen anything like it before but looks cool!

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHA.  Dude was about to cooperate, then Will Farrell goes APESHIT on his ass.
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaThis is like Cop Out, but actually FUNNY!
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitalol dirk diggler, tooth fairy, elf, windu, beetlejuice, all in one movie.
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshita...In all honesty I&#39;d rather see a movie with JUST Samuel L. Motha&#39; Humpin&#39; Jackson and the Rock.
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m starting to think that Samuel L. Jackson doesn&#39;t age.
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitalets not forget michael keaton..... hes also in there.... just sayn...

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshita&quot;The movie industry is completely irresponsible for the way they portray explosions!&quot;
Now they tell us!

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitathat explosion-bit is so true!
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitalol sounds funny, I will not buy it :D
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitahahahaha

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitanot a will ferrell fan but it does look funny
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitai wish they would take it easy in the action here and just focus on the comedy.. the main faults of Tropic Thunder and Get Smart was that because it has the budget, it tried to use it in every way as possible. sometimes(and in films like this), less is more let the actors control the movie, not the big budget
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaFerrell!
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitawill ferrells the shit hands down
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitathis started out with the rock and samuel L.then mark and will took over lol it looks hilarious  but most films just edit the good parts in then when you watch it you find its not has funny like cop out.but mark w.playing a comedic roll should be interesting
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitais that michaels boss from the office? the jumper? he kinda sounded like steve carell
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaoh this looks good. mark wahlberg and will ferrel, i never saw them pairing up but because they did IT LOOKS AWESUM!

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaI gotta watch this especially because of the cast and hope that it will be a good comedy,call me superficial...don t care
D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaWill Ferrell is a beast, but this looks like its gonna flop.

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshita@RadovanEdmond You still laugh at GTA jokes?

D6WOoUG1eNodelimeterByIshitaTHE MOVIE INDUSTRY IS COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY THEY PORTRAY EXPLOSIONS.

QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitahaha...yip
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome. cant wait.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s probably one of those movies where her memories are wiped to protect her identity.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaHaha, who cares about all the other spy movies,

QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI may be seeing this over the summer.

QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitasup DinoBoy31,  
i dunno dude, guess i&#39;ve always used &#39;bad arse&#39; instead of &#39;bad ass&#39; like most people do.  Just something different i suppose.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitawhy do you say arse?
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks bad arse! She is always fkn hot :)

They should make  a kick arse , action packed , gun movie with Angelina Jolie and Mila Jovavich the best hottest action movie chicks on the planet !
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie will be worth watching.. Cant wait!...

Die all haters!..
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitashes not hot any more
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t we all .. rofl
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaWow... another movie with a good premise but a trailer that gives too much away.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitayeah i know, its just a weird name for a movie
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitasalt? what kind of movie name is that?
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshita@thekissofdeath87 yeah because in changeling she was exactly the same, too
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaCool O.O
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitalooks like a great movie
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitayep...
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaUh...so...why did she run in the first place?  Nobody believed in the Russian national...so she just runs because the writer didn&#39;t know how to get the movie going?  Good job...
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaActually she did a few movies before she made out with her brother on screen and her father cut ties.  She didn&#39;t cut ties, he did and only after her career had started.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitasuch a good role for her, Can&#39;t wait to see it!!!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaGo Albany!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitashe&#39;s a Jason Bourne wannabe
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaYou must be joking. She did grow up around Hollywood&#39;s elite. If you think that didn&#39;t help her get anywhere, you are a real moron.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThe female answer to the Bourne trilogy.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaOh my fucking god... I&#39;ll just enjoy the movie and keep being neutral to both countries.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaamen to that, it was completely and utterly useless
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaoff the wall jump punch was kinda weak
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitammmm Angelina Jolie! hot!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaLooks another  full of hateridge propaganda of hollywood against Russia.
hollywood never stops cold wars.Mind sculpting  cruel mashine doesn&#39;t have rest.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitashe is actually looks like russian ( in this movie)
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaits a little weak
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a fun movie
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitadroooool
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitawhoa!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaAngelina is awesome!!!!  i love all her work. she is totally kick-ass!!!!!!!!!!!!1
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshita1:49 are you serious what do u think r u in the matrix or something?lame
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshita1:47 very lame punch
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaLooks dumb. Can&#39;t anyone in Hollywood write an intelligent plot anymore?
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaYeah I&#39;d see it.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitai will see any moive with her in it i dont care what it is about
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaFor me the plot and sub-plot&#39;s lack of development pale in comparison to the bogus explosions and lack of a hair being out of place, as though a chick having the worst day of her life still could look hot and together.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaJolie is lookin pretty good but the whole russian spy thing is kinda 007ish..
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaDaniel Fucks Angelina
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaoh god...
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaWell, your daddy wasn&#39;t exactly a Hollywood star, was he? You don&#39;t have connections like she does.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitathis will be a hit movie
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitalol the whole evil russian thing feels so old and trite... Jolie is mega-hot though.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitathat hair color makes her look really old =/
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s actually not too old, the plastic surgery and her poor acting abilities are the problem.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThis should end Angelina Jolie&#39;s career for good. She is a TERRIBLE actress, and all the plastic surgery makes her look older than she really is. She ruins every movie she stars in. It&#39;s real nice to have connections, huh? Oh yeah, the plot is VERY unoriginal, and Jolie is just NOT an action star!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI like the concept on the base level of having a female protagonist being like in a male action hero blockbuster, but I just don&#39;t feel she has the chops. And it&#39;s been done so much, aped by the Bourne films.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaO_o
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitai dont get it.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitathis looks prety cool
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaAngelina always make the movie look good XD
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitahaha, so true
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitasooo wats left? Didnt that pretty much show us the entire story? Good 2 minute movie. That was fun...
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitai got so lost when she automaticaly started running away out of no where

but still looks really good
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m sold
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitait kinda looks like another minority report
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitawould have looked like a another Mission Impossible with Tom, no wonder why he backed out. plus Angelina looks so good doing this too
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaMeh....
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaComment = win
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaWall jump at 1:48 was a tad bit unnecessary
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a substitute for her too..
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaYeah if Tom Cruise did this, it would just be another Minority Report (Which was great but not That great)
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI really dislike movies that have female characters that kick ass as if they were chuck norris.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitai was thinking the same thing ,!!!
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI liked this movie better when it was called North By Northwest.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaYou can see a super big spoiler at 1:47
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaI probably shouldn&#39;t have laughed as loud as I did...that was funny.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThat looks kind of awesome ! I want to see it !! :D
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshita@imarblooper i know that was lame, but thats funny
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaBourne + Vantage Point
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitaThe story plot looks recycled, but might be a good movie.
QZ40WlshNwUdelimeterByIshitalooks ok

tAiy66Xrsz4delimeterByIshitaWhile many fans&#39; favorite HP film is either Prisoner of Azkaban or Deathly Hallows, Half-blood Prince will always be my favorite Harry Potter film. This trailer alone is too epic.

T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaWhile the film doesn&#39;t show Canada&#39;s involvement to the fullest it&#39;s still a great nonetheless. Don&#39;t let the truth blind your judgement of a great film.
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitagood film
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaTaking a poll: How many feel what percentage of involvement did our good neighbours to the north(Canada) played a part in getting those hostages out of Iran? Just curious.
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaArgo is a Great Movie. But this movie kinda makes the americans think of the citizens of iran as Anti-america....Ben Afleck should have better emphasize the 1953 Iranian coup d&#39;√©tat  orchestrated by the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom (under the name &#39;Operation Boot&#39;) and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project). SO this whole revolution thing is basicly AMERICA&#39;s an GREAT BRITAIN&#39;S FAULT.
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaAerosmith - Dream on ! :)
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaDo well done. I was on the edge of my seat every second of the movie.

T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaput that ego aside affleck!!! u don&#39;t have to be on screen!! it might make for an even better movie!! 
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitafukn a! 
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaI like Cranston. Affleck should stick to directing, not acting.

T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitawait...  ha ha ha...  I like  Ben A but the timing of this movie stinks.  I really hope that this movie doesn&#39;t make Iran out to be monsters.  For christ&#39;s sake - the revolution at the time was to get rid of a Puppet dictator that the
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaI like
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this one.

T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaIs this a comedy?  It&#39;s funny!
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaWhich is the song?
T29kIOXpj6odelimeterByIshitaThough it&#39;s based on a true story it&#39;s a tense thriller with the involvement of Hollywood for real!

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny because I thought this was a parody of a sports film, but now I&#39;m intrigued.But it is &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; with Brits.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaEGGSY!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaSo proud of Taron for getting out there! Can&#39;t wait to see what else he&#39;s got to show, and I&#39;m excited for the second Kingsman &lt;3
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s not that kind of movie bro...PEACE
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how you can do a trailer this bad. Not only does it just make the movie look like a cookie-cutter basic underdog film, but it shows all of the important scenes in the movie. The only thing not shown is whether or not he got a gold medal.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song name that&#39;s in this trailer?
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is playing in this trailer. Like midway through
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaAww Taron :,)
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaEddie looks kinda like billy Cranston from mighty morphin power rangers.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaThat moment you realize it&#39;s Eggsy from Kingsmen (o.O) I should&#39;ve known, it is Matthew Vaugh&#39;s MARV after all...

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why but I know Ima cry because of this movie
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI cried during this trailer and I&#39;m not ashamed of it

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaWas that Christopher Walken there?! Why does it not surprise me that he would be in this? :-0

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI was still a baby during the 88 Olympics in Calgary, but it seems like there was real magic going on during those Olympics with the Jamaican Bobsled team and this young man. I&#39;m looking forward to this movie.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song in this
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaLooks quite good. The trailer alone is inspiring :)
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaLove Eddie the Eagle.  His positive spirit was so inspiring at the Calgary Olympics.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaEggsy The Eagle
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was Matthew Lewis in the beginning
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI so can relate for anyone who keeps going despite what anyone says!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI remember this guy!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh!!! Egsy!!!! xD he looked better in Kingsman for sure. thus movie looks interesting though
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitano reason to watch, thanks Fox great trailer saves me money.....................fucktards
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaDid Eddie the Eagle jump in V-style? I thought they didn&#39;t really use the V-style until the 90s.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert: The Norwegians win it
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitastop playing around logan, dont u know the apocalypse is coming ?!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaIs that you Egsy?!

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaHow inspiring.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaLooks very inspirational and very funny at the same time! Plus...HUGH!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaThis is beautiful. All you have to do is belive. Such a beautiful word.. Belive
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaCool trailer.... Hugh looks awesome
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t remember who won the competition, but I remember Eddie the Eagle.  He&#39;s one of my favorite memories of the Olympics.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI expect a cameo from the Jamaican bobsled team.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaThey even got the color of the suit just right, except you missed the little eagle on the shoulder if I recall correctly.:) Eddie gave that suit to my Dad since they were the same size, I stomped around in it as a kid, even wore it with all his medals hanging around my neck as a costume. What a tremendous man and great person, we all loved his sense of humor and humbleness, and daring love of the sport. To all who shared his story and help keep jumping alive.....Keep flying Eddie...... Best, a Chivers kid.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaI rember this guy from the sport news growing up, always wondering if he&#39;d fall or not..

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaGlad Taron has some acting range
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaREADY TO EAGLE ! <br>Wohhhhh!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a by the numbers zero to hero movie but a really really good one. Hugh Jackman seems great.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaNot many trailers that send shivers down my spine but this is one of them
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaOMG This trailer is AMAZING I can¬¥t waait üíõ <br>I love Taron Egerton ‚ù§Ô∏è

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaGood ol&#39; Eddie. Get in there son. Most thought he was a joke but nobody who does ski jumping is a joke.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaHave they just remade Cool Runnings but now racists can enjoy it too?
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaEggsy meets the Wolverine!
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaSo this is the reason why wolverine is not in the X-men apocalypse...

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaTrue stories are always an inspiration.
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaWow really liked the movie was a little short, around 4 minutes but it had a good morale...

hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaLast time I was this early I became a dad
hyzQjVUmIxkdelimeterByIshitaSee Eddie fly. Watch the new trailer for Eddie the Eagle, starring Hugh Jackman. In theaters February 26.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaBahahaha...<br>Fuck you, movie.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWow can&#39;t wait!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaYet another remnant of my childhood ruined by the PG sector of Hollywood.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI would have loved to see a movie more like &quot; Dont Thing about it,&quot; or&quot; the Haunted Mask,&quot; this just seems like a horrible slapstick kids movie. Which in my opinion is a really bad way to go. They should have made a movie targeting the goosebumps fans, meaning the movie should appeal to the kids who were around when the books came out, who are now in there late 20s at least.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks like yet another CGI Monster fest, which is just so disappointing considering this could&#39;ve been practical effects heaven for a talented FX studio. I don&#39;t think a single creature in this trailer was even partially practical. It looks alright, looks like tons of fun in the vein of monster squad which I&#39;m absolutely open to but I&#39;m just so disappointed that this looks more or less.. generic.. for such an imaginative original idea.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaDisappointed. I&#39;d take the 90&#39;s tv series over this abomination. 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaOMG!! Are you kidding me?!!! I remember the books and remember how freaky it was but this, oh Geezz.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most blatant use of nostalgia in a &quot;remake&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s not even a new story! It&#39;s just about the books. Get ready for 2 hours of &quot;oh yah... I remember that one.&quot;
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI won&#39;t be satisfied until I see the severed head of Carly Beth&#39;s dummy that her Mother made her...I mean, it&#39;s not really the horror part of the story, I just want it. Also, they should have used the props from the original show, like the Dummy.¬†<br><br>Also, that&#39;s the kid who played Carey in Super 8. Fun fact.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaShit CGI, shit story, shitty comedy.<br><br>RIP Goosebumps. :(
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaSuch an ingenious way of adapting the stories and making R.L. ¬†himself a character.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually ok with them going with a comedic route, i mean, the original series was really shitty (with the exeption of a few episodes) but it was just another tv series with cringeworthy writing and acting. Even the books weren&#39;t that scary, well they were for kids and as a kid i liked the stories because it was like reading a censored stephen king. in a way, knowing that as a theatrical release movie it wasn&#39;t going to do so well as a kid friendly horror movie, so why not just make a new story revolving around the characters of the books and make this into a family friendly comedy. well as long as the movie portays the monsters as they should be and not just make them generic monsters it would be a movie i would like to see
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, the original goosebumps books were goofy and funny enough. From the looks of the trailer, it&#39;s just being intentionally goofy and funny. It probably won&#39;t be good, but I highly doubt it&#39;s going to be awful.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaYou know how it claims &#39;only one movie will give you Goosebumps&#39; yeah it won&#39;t be this movie.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaMeta.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitawell, this looks terrible and is missing the entire point of the goosebumps books.¬† To give you fucking goosebumps
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWow, this trailer gives me GOOSEBUMPS. (I know, totally original, there probably won&#39;t be a hundred other people commenting this exact thing, right?)
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who thought this was going to be horror Idk why they would. I figured it would be something like this.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaPure CRAP!!!! Speaking as an extremely biased Goosebumps fan, this looks like shit... And I really didn&#39;t want it to.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible. Why does this look like kiddy comedy and not even a mixture of dark humor and horror? And the music is terrible. 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaGuys, this is a movie for kids, not a horror movie, and this movie actually seems funny.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaHmm...I think I liked it better when it was called Jumanji.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI loved Goosbumps when i was a kid so i&#39;ll watch this
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaNevermind &quot;RIP GOOSEBUMPS&quot;...the books will outlast this movie, their legacy is sealed.¬†<br><br>what i came to say is<br><br>RIP JACK BLACK
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s happening with Sony? Pixels? And now a loosely horrific Goosebumps movie??
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaIn the beginning of the trailer it looked like a good thriller movie, then toward the end it looked like a stupid kids movie. Ugh.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWhat a load of absolute guff.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThe comments here are laughable. Suck it up and wait till October will ya all?! Love how you&#39;re all passing judgement on a film that you&#39;ve only seen trailers for.. Anyone would think you had seen the whole film already...SMH
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaSo according to Sony, CG characters courtesy of Imageworks + family-friendly comedy = worthy of the Sony Pictures Animation label. Hasn&#39;t that label been wasted enough since Hotel 1? Might as well give that label to Pixels while you still have the time, god damn it.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWas I the only one who didn&#39;t recognize Jack Black as the dad?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaMy flaws with the trailer:<br>1. Making all the monsters CGI including the dummy and gnomes that aren&#39;t both as scary like from the show which made them look good.¬†<br>2. Jack Black as R.L. Stine, its like casting Mike Myers as Stephen King in any of his movies...not a wise idea and don&#39;t you guys try it!<br>3. The boy that bites into the werewolf...yeah I find him annoying right off the bat.<br>4. Where is the awesome Goosebumps theme song and the guy in black that causes the pages to fly away into a nice quiet town while the theme song plays?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not gonna sit here and act like the books or the TV show were a pinnacle of greatness, because they weren&#39;t. You read/watch &#39;em again as an adult and they&#39;re unbelievably dumb. But I feel like a Goosebumps movie should try to recapture the way these books felt when we read them as kids - a mix of horror and laughs that stays exciting all the way through, with protagonists you can relate to and monsters that are genuinely creepy.<br><br>This just looks...well, unbelievably dumb. And I mean intentionally dumb, like they made this movie to say &quot;Goosebumps? Boy, that was stupid, am I right?&quot; And yeah, it was, but that&#39;s not how we remember it.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitawho is this movie for? The age range who read these books at their popular are adults. Kids have no idea what this is
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a comedy movie wtf GOOSEBUMPS is horror -_- .
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThought this would be horror not a fucking comedy...
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason i thought this was Ghost Busters...
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI didnt read the books, didnt grow up with them...I must the trailer looks amusing...But ill be cautious....Lets see when its in the theater.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re completely bastardizing the nature of the books. Ugh...
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn716jv61s&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a> SHUT UP FUCKING IDIOT!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis is a mandatory downvote. DOWNVOTE!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what you guys watched when you were kids, but the Goosebumps books and even moreso the show did not take themselves seriously that often. ¬†Bad Hare Day, Chicken, Chicken, It came from beneath the sink were ridiculous. ¬†This movie could be a lot worse, and I&#39;m at least super down with them finding a way to get every monster in the movie
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaCGI is absolutely terrible
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis Movie is ¬†a Comedy, not Terror.<br>but jack black rules!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaif I were R.L. Stine, I&#39;d feel like shit after watching this
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaJumanji 2015 Edition.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks super fun. I love a good kids&#39; monster romp. I&#39;ll take my littles to see this for sure. :)
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThey somehow managed to turn my childhood horror manuals into a giant comedic feature length movie...¬† disappointed.¬† I know its aimed for kids, but still, they went too far man.¬† The goosebumps TV series was even better than this lol.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping for a creepy movie, not a generic comedy.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWtf? Why are they making this into a cute comedy? Goosebumps is supposed to genuinely be terrifying. One of my favorite series to read as a kid has officially been ruined. Great.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaNow this looks stupid... not the horror stories I grew up with
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaPlease please let them fly<br>With #52 how I learned to fly
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like an ok movie. Not the best as a Goosebumps adaptation but at least it&#39;s not Jem level of bad.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaNO.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaOh man, this movie looks so stupid and strangely funny. Nothing is going to make sense, there&#39;s gonna be stupid moments everywhere, and some little kids will be scared of it.<br><br>It&#39;s just like the books! I&#39;m actually kinda looking forward to it.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaomfg really? a comedy?! ugh
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaSo they mixed Inkheart with Jumanji and named it goosebumps. Oh boy. Not so disappointed for the fact that it&#39;s not a horror film but so much the fact that this formulaic story is predictable and standard. It would have worked better as an episode for the simpsons.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaScooby Doo anyone? 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaEsperaba m√°s de este trailer y me he quedado decepcionado, espero que la pel√≠cula sea buena ...
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song in trailer? 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaAs a 90&#39;s kid &amp; fan of the books, all I have to say is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.&quot;TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!&quot;
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis would&#39;ve been the greatest movie ever in 2000.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaMeh. I&#39;ll give it a try.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaSo this is that movie based off the horror book franchise everyone was wanting...other than Ghostbusters?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis seemed fun, but not anymore. Besides the characters, this takes nothing from the books.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps are children&#39;s books and this is a children&#39;s movie
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t feel like they realized why Goosebumps is so loved, It&#39;s not because it&#39;s a comedy or a adventure like story, but because it took itself so seriously and tried it&#39;s best to be scary for the kids it was aimed for that looking back it&#39;s cheesy and pretty funny.<br>It&#39;s just a trailer though so whatever really.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitadoes the evil garden gnomes bit remind anyone else of gravity falls?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s based on a kids book series and all of you are mad because this is targeted for kids lol
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaCautiously optimistic.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaInteresting idea for the film, totally Jumanji but with monsters.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaExtraordinarily disappointed that the theme song wasn&#39;t used at all. I don&#39;t think the director watched a single episode of the show.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWell, Goosebumps has always been kind of cheesy, so this is fine I guess (for me at least).
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaReally disappointed. What the hell is this? Goosebumps? I don&#39;t feel any goosebumps! Clearly it&#39;s not from the books they took inspiration.<br>The tv series was better than this!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThe beginning was pretty bad but the rest of the trailer was amazing so cool!!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI think everyone is taking this too seriously.<br>I mean, it&#39;s Goosebumps.<br>It&#39;s not like it&#39;s supposed to be terrifying.<br>Has everyone forgotten how funny those books were?<br>Sure there was a horror element to then, but that wasn&#39;t the whole story.<br>They were silly but somehow great.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a Nickelodeon movie.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshita&quot;So, with this new Goosebumps script, I assume you want me to incorporate a lot of the frightening and fun aspects of the beloved series, right?&quot;<br>&quot;Nah, we just want you to make it safe, non-threatening, marketable fun. ¬†Oh, and model it off Cabin in the Woods but without the thrills and sharp satire.&quot;<br>&quot;Uhh, are...are you sure?&quot;<br>&quot;Positive.&quot;
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThe only movie I&#39;m going to see from Sony Pictures is Pixels. This movie looks okay...
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaI sooooo want to watch this but there is a clown and I hate them sad face<br>
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitawell that was awful
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitamy expectations for this movie were low but this actually looks good. i&#39;m not gonna see it i&#39;ll just buy it on dvd
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis is all but Goosebumps
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this movie suppose to be, like, scary?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThe trailers that leaked during the Sony hack were A LOT better than the official ones released today. (The UK trailer is slightly better than the US trailer, at least). ¬†The trailers from the hack made the Goosebumps movie look like a modern-day &quot;The Monster Squad&quot;. The horrible music choice, and the decision to heavily feature the Hannah love story arc in the trailers indicates that they&#39;re trying to reach young girls who may not be interested in, or aware of, Goosebumps, and taking the other audiences for granted. The Sony hack trailers had a good mix of darkness and humor. ¬†This just looks like a manic, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;-like mess. I guess Sony wasted too much money cutting 2 trailers for &quot;Pixels&quot; and dumping &quot;Aloha&quot; into theaters to cut a decent, finished trailer for &quot;Goosebumps&quot;.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaThis atmosphere sucks! It&#39;s not creepy at all
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaGuys, take off your nostalgia goggles. The show was fucking terrible. The Haunting Hour was an improvement, but still not good. The books aren&#39;t frightening at all unless you&#39;re seven.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaJUMANJI !!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cliche &#39;boy meets girl meets supernatural monsters&#39; movie.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaWell, my hope for this film has decreased by quite a bit.¬†<br><br>The problem is, they aren&#39;t trying to make this at all creepy looking, but an adventure comedy that could come out anytime of year, but this is coming out near Halloween.<br><br>Probably should have taken more notes from the TV show.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitano GOOSEBUMPS
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps the series, for life. This movie, not so much.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitawhy do i feel its gonna be the same as Pixels?
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaHope it has the original theme tune when it comes out 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about time. I love the goosebumps series and I can&#39;t wait for this movie. Sure it&#39;s not a horror movie but I think it will be fine. Slappy better be funny and awesome in this.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Goosebumps! Thanks for killing our childhoods SONY!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a fun movie. Maybe I&#39;ll go check it out.
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks not bad!
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaLooks okay. I have a feeling Jack Black might fuck it up. 
7Cn716jv61sdelimeterByIshitaMeh, we&#39;ll still watch it.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaOF COURSE

AGREED!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHA! I love you dude no homo.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaRead the comment the other guy made, he said 12+12=44, why the hell do you think I put a question mark at the end off 44 on my first comment?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitayay i cant wait to die
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitait will not rain fire.....
and we will not die of a flood.....
that&#39;s retarded but i still wanna see the movie lol
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita12+12=44? 44 divided by 6 = 7.6 Billion?
Either you wrote something wrong or you never learned math.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitai really can&#39;t help but laugh not because the movie looks bad which it doesn&#39;t but just that hollywood found another cheap way to make money off of us
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita@ wheresmylife

all I&#39;m saying is that if a millionaire and a dirt poor man both win the lottery, who do you think is more likely to thank god

@ everyone reading this

you are the driving force in your life that makes thing happen. you can believe in god but don&#39;t rely on him to make you life a meaningful one. take things into your own hands. cut out the middleman and take charge. Deist believe this. And you know some people who were deist? almost all of Americas founding fathers!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t be scare. =] It might not even happen... =P
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThis movie give us a wake up call. Must watch!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaPeople, PLEASE!! People, please do a good research on this topic before you place any comments! There is lot of shit about this on the web but  as well lot of logic things. 
PLEASE SEE:  &#39; timeline to 2012 &#39; on youtube 

GREAT PLACE TO START SEARCH!!!!!! 
I looked trough a lot of shit on the web and I highly recommend this.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThese kinds of movies like 2012, independence day, the day after tomorrow and war of the worlds can really make you think about the future for children generation, even terminator.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaits called the final judgement
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaNICE CGI!  AMAZING!

Other than that, I have no comment, having not seen it.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita2:02

Poor Obama.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaso sick in HD this is one of the movies you must see in theaters for full enjoyment
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaMuch like Dr. Manhattan wouldn&#39;t you say?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita&quot;Before the world was even created He knew each person&quot; So.. what about babies that were born deformed, retards and the like? O.o
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaBwuaha, Beserk Blood.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaZOMG NUGGETS
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitathis is gonna be a kick-ass movie!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitanow why would god kill all of us in this fashion is he sick or something why not end it quickly instead of throwing people into chaos this god thing has really got some problems.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitasince the comments already have steered clear of practicly any relations to the trailer i feel that i might as well say this: Man is not a creation of god, 
god is a creation of Man
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaplus, god is some almighty being. beyond the laws of time and space. everything has already happened or is happening, from his perspective. meaning that if something terrible happened that was bad enough for him to want to change it, he already has and praying has no affect. besides, prayer, the way church describes it, is just a placebo affect. The answer god gives are in the form of yes, no, or wait. what else works this way? a magic eight ball. no matter what, it seems like god answered you.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawheresmylife

I think caring about my children would be affected negatively by having 6 billion if you only count humans. a lot more if you count animals. way more if you count aliens, who likely exist. I agree with writest&#39;s comment. god did put us on earth and there is a heaven and hell, but praying to god for a personal problem is just vain to think he cares. yet ever day people pray to god for things like winning the lottery or getting a promotion, and the church doesn&#39;t see a problem there?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitano deber√≠an hacer pel√≠culas as√≠ en estos tiempos de tanto estr√©s y tragedias en el mundo.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaChk this out cuzin....
He doesnt... how cud a single human being prayn or even the whole world bowin down to god matter to Him... BUT God cud do anything to a humanbeing... u shud be thankful ur even given a life...by who? The God.. then i think u have probably heard of paradise... bt u cant even imagine it now... nether can u imagine the horrors of hell.. no one can its just too much.. nd these are the choices u are given u play wit ur life or u pray just to praise the almighty....
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaActually mayan culture belived that world was gonna end, but as a symbolic end, the old earth will fall and the new earth shall rise....more simple, the world is not gonna end, it&#39;s just that something big is gonna happen, i dunno, maybe aliens will visit us, or we will dyscover new technology, or maybe the autobots will arrive to earth...who knows...but one thing is sure..THE WORLD IS NOT GONNA END!!!!!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaat wheresmylife

If Christianity believes that through prayer and believing in god he will lead them to a sin free (or less sinful) life, they completely contradict the idea of a perfect god. If god is perfect, then he would have set things right to start with. this is to say that by intervening in anyone&#39;s life, he is admitting he was wrong to begin with. I think that humans are extremely vain to think god really cares about their individual life enough to answer their personal prayers.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita100100% i promise u guys that there is no END in 2012
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaTell me that wasnt  Danny Glover as the president....thatd be awesome
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitatotally agree..
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaok just watch this video and it will explain it for me

watch?v=OXbqMahqTOQ
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThis kind of movie will probably help your religion (if you have one) gather more believers.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitayou COULDN&#39;T care less. It doesnt make any sense otherwise
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitalooks so epic I how it does not sucks because these guys made a lot of bad movies
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitafor real
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaWho cares if it&#39;s going to happen?  All I care about is how awesome this movie looks!

Lets not forget how to use our imagination and pretend for 2 hours.  Try it -- it&#39;s fun!

Can&#39;t wait &#39;till December!  &quot;Avatar&quot; is another great movie that will be released around the same time.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaonly God knows the date of the end
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitacant wait until this doesnt happen so ppl will stop talking about it and believing that it will happen!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawOw..nICe
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThe Mayan calendar doesn&#39;t really end on the 2012.  They understood the linearity of time.  Their calendar goes on in perpetuity.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitathis movie looks like it can really kick some ass but it is not going to happen in real life like get real ppl who make these movies
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitak correction ... around 2012 dec. 21.....anywayz dont beleive its true......bt da concept of dhooms day is pretty scary n thrilling....
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaomg my class had a disscusion about this few months ago...I think the rxact date told was 2012 dec. 26th ...apparently some ancient chinese calandar ends on the exact date.....its hard to beleive such things... guess we&#39;ll have to wait 3 more years to over rule any doubt
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaPeople will look back on 2012 like they did with the millennium bug.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitamaybe its time for us to treat and care our world more. save our planet and save our soul.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawow nice effects !
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaahah me2
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitai will definately watch this movie
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita&quot;What are the odds?&quot; 

&quot;hehe&quot;

-ASTROIDS-

Well, fuck.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure this will be interesting, but looks too fake...
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitai did a report on the myan temple in mexico.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t tell the world when its going to end,
let it end when it want to
or when God says.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome/ I really liked the day after tomorrow so I&#39;m gonna see it
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaNoone Knows When The World Will End.
Only God Knows.

But Damn I Had My Mouth Open The Whole Entire Time I Was Seein This Tralier.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer has certainly hyped me up for the movie.  Will be interesting to see.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitalooks like a cool flick
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a sweet movie!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitai believe in god not this crap!!!!!!!!!!
go to hell and stop making money off of putting shit into people!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaIt looks awesome!
Just wondering what the real story is and how it&#39;s gonna end..?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitarolland emmerich is the irwin allan of the 21st century.
amazing sfx, coupled with tepid drama and non-existent
science. enjoy view, turn off brain. bitch, please.
JWP.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaIn my opinion, 2012 was probably the myan equivalent of the y2k bug. I&#39;m sure that if their civ survived, they would have come up with an appropriate patch for their calender that would have kept their planes from falling out of the sky, just like we did.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawell... the only thing we can really do, is move along for now, and see later. 
But, maybe we can avoid shit, if we stop being dumb people, and killing each other brother&#39;s and sister&#39;s.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitayou right!
Americans will stop harrasing the globe!
Stupid nation they are!!! really!!!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think the world will end, its just going to be a big change.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitao sure ya Im not saying that u were one of those guys haha.. 

but i mean maybe the end of their calender just signifies that it will repeat.. like it would start again from the beginning... like we have Jan 1st as out new year.. maybe they went a step further and established a &quot;galactic year&quot; 

so December 31st would equal December 21st 2012! does that make sence? but i mean it could mean a number of things not that the world will end.. lol
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaYes the Mayans are very credible.. and yes they can predict things which was very advanced! Yet they did NOT say that the world would end! just that the CALENDER would end!! Also on December 22 2012, the solar system will be aliened with the center of our galaxy.. Maybe that was what they were predicting.. NOT the &quot;End of the World!&quot;

PLUS! if they couldn&#39;t predict their own demise.. what makes u think they can predict ours??
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaYes the Mayans are very credible.. and yes they can predict things which was very advanced! Yet they did NOT say that the world would end! just that the CALENDER would end!! Also on December 22 2012, the solar system will be aliened with the center of our galaxy.. Maybe that was what they were predicting.. NOT the &quot;End of the World!&quot;

PLUS! if they couldn&#39;t predict their own demise.. what makes u think they can predict ours??
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaGod this looks terrible.

Fortunately for the producers it&#39;ll make money because people are idiots.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaMy god... may this day end soon. Heaven is stealing us our stars!!!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaHAHAHA. :D you just made my day.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawow how fake...the movie looks good but the story...come on i mean y 2012 y not 2011 or 2013..then there&#39;s dec 21 y not 20 or 22 religous things
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaCGI are so noticeable here. Like really noticeable.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaa classic american movie...Explosions,disasters,explosions again,disasters once again...blablabla..Nothin special about it.0/5.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaJust cause the Mayans predicted it doesn&#39;t mean that it will happen. I mean the technology we have is far more superior then what the Mayans had. But like Minango0 said &quot;the world&#39;s going to end when GOD wants it to&quot;.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitasomething will happen on that date but its not the end of the world lol
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitadanm rite dude live life till the end realy comes
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawe cant do enything we sit here and wayt till the day realy comes and wen it dus then its time for all of us to go
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitamy world just ended
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitai remember 1999 on new years eve before the clock turned midnight for 2000 a lot of people were freaking out and crying because of the y2k scare
i think if the world is going to end its going to be a very random day
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitathis is bull  just like the 2000 shit that never happen
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaman u fucking shits .....nobody is capable of deciding the last day accept Allah ...........
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaof course it&#39;s not true, because it&#39;s not happen yet. quite epic drama here... but when it does, have you prepare?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitalet say the mayan was mistaken... let say that every looney out there were mistaken... what makes you right then???

this is movie... those apocalyptic events are another story...  what make&#39;s it different is these crazy bullshit believer makes their preparation than you are.

if it&#39;s truly time to go to hell... at least they don&#39;t mock God because of their disbelieve.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitabig lie is about clock ticking... keep counting dude!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaWow i have to see this movie
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitadude same omggg 3 times today!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaJOHN CUSACK IS THA MAN!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshita2:19 pwnd hahahah I LOVE THIS movie well going to!!!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaI cannot wait this this comes out!!!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaDitto! Movie looks amazing!
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaomfg....
OMFG!
Kick ass graphics, sick sick sick sick movie D:
And hell yeah looks better than any other apocalyptic movie EVAH~
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaare they basing in the crazy prophecy of the maya culture?
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitalooks great, but sorry, this 2012 thing is so out there.. no chance for a believable film, no matter how good the visual effects.
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaNice Graphics
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitawoah...better than day after tomorrow
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitathis looks pretty awesome
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaIt looks good to me :D
ce0N3TEcFw0delimeterByIshitaepic
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaAn underrated gem of a movie.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was terrible. No story and the vampire scenes werent great
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaAnything with Nick Damici in it is a plus for me but this film is amazing! üëåüèª
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThis is an absolute classic for anyone that hasn&#39;t seen change that immediately!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaSL3!!!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaI barely remember this movie but I remember the girl sleeping then turns her head and shows her teeth was the creepiest bit. Back in my blue ghost popping days
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaGREAT MOVIE!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this when it first came out and just found out there are new eps
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaShitty movie, don&#39;t bother watching it.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaTurns 10 today!<br>I remember watching it back at my second house <br>Still one of the hardest horror films to watch <br>But it&#39;s a well-told human story about a band of survivors trying to make it in an apocalypse dominated by vampires, not only is humanity wiped out but any sense of lingering hope and prosperity <br>Amazing gore, intense, scary, and emotional at times tugging at the heartstrings <br>The heavy music and powerful acting help elevate it from the typical horror movie
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThis is a superb film.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitasucks ass  hollywood runs zoombie movies in dirt to death! because they think we the people are xombies! idots and morons who submit to government! not this dude! i am awake and this sucks as all zombie movies do! retarded

xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaAre the movies good?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaWeak storyline &amp; poor plot... cinemetography &amp; editing are superb.. second half is boring. Few scenes lookz attractive
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie! Happy Halloween 2019!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitathis is what twilight should have been about
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaname of the song at the end?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s on netflix :]

xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else on a Horror movie trailer marathon?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaIF you&#39;re here and you haven&#39;t watched this movie yet.. oh gosh.. i really highly recommend this.. it&#39;s one of the coolest, genius and brilliant movie, I&#39;ve ever seen :)
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitamy friend is a wuss

xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitagood movie?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshita-shudders- You sound like Ke$ha..........
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaBLAAA BLAAA BLAAAA
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaIf it good what would it matter? Just because they added &quot;land&quot; doesn&#39;t mean its a Zombieland rip off. At least watch it before you say that sort of stuff.... :/
Like how I watched every Paranormal Activity. Because I watched all of them I can say I thought it was crap and put up a good argument on why.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitagood movie... 
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaMeh.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitafaith in vampire restored..........
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitafucking lame piece of trash, copy zombieland
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitadont know that a post apocalyptic movie could be that touching. nice touching movie and well acting by all. 
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaStake n&#39; chips..........
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is like the road with zeds lol
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitacmon guys why does it just 7 dislikes, dont make me watch a zombie/vampire movie?!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshita@BuzzkillCircusofSin for me its much beter than zombieland :D
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitahey its the little girl from GG
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaWhy do ppl like comments that just repeat what they said in the trailer?? IDIOTS!!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaGOOD vampire movies are untapped gold that hollywood doesn&#39;t even look at.  they&#39;re to busy recycling old movies or coming out with the most ludicous crap.  Not love sick sparkly vampires like twilight.  Underworld is good, but Selene is the only one who does anything; the rest of the vamps may as well be human.  I want to see a fast paced Matrix type vampire movie that actually shows the awesomeness of being one, because anybody can do martial arts and shoot a gun
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaLive free, or die trying?? Wtf, bitches be copying 50 Cent !

xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaI swear....I dont even care about the movie,some of your comments are pure gold:)
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaok...zombie-like vampires....hmmm... a must see.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaI was reading Skate Land the whole time
I was like what does Skating have to do with vampires anyway!!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitathis movie is very very good 10+, but it was so sick when the bloodsuckingmotherfucker killed a baby, i understand that this is movie, but it was not a normal thing,  i would watch this movie many  times again, but after seing that i dont want to feel thoose emotions again
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitammmmm...steakland A*drool*
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshita:50 scared the bejesus outta me!!!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitabest film of 2011
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song in trailer?!!
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitathis is gonna happen when a billion teenage girls all get seduced by an edward twilight looking vampire. we&#39;d be overrun in hrs by those wishing for immortality and vamp lovin. only grisly old josh brolin/mickey rourke lookalikes packin wooden stakes,huntin rifles and ww2 revolvers are our only hope....cos blade got locked up by the vampires at the irs and buffy got killed by a zombie george.a.romero on a movie set with no exits cos she couldnt afford pack a punch.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaZombieland remake...but not funny
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshita@BuzzkillCircusofSin that&#39;s way off. Zombieland was a comedy. This looks to be a more serious film. If it was a comedy then you might be right. 
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitathis movie is pretty solid what are you people bitching about
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThe vampires looked more like zombies who preferred blood rather brains....
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaThis is a scary movie? Evil dead or the shining are scarier.. Give us something really good! I&#39;m tired of these shitty wannabe scary movies! When&#39;s the last time you got scared?
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaabout time a movie is about about more realilistic vampires and hunters looks promising.
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaDID SOMEBODY SAY STEAK?!

xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshita@andysanj Comes out today in limited release (April 22).
xN6_TlQmV5AdelimeterByIshitaActually looks quite good, do you know when it comes out or if it already is?
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaDude, you are spouting nonsense. The film is meticulously researched. It has its basis in fact. And it does not deal with the GDR as a whole just with one aspect of it. And what it shows in this regard, can hardbly be denied. Konrad Wolf&#39;s films cannot be compared to &#39;Lives of Others&#39; at all.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitathis has the best ending in the history of movies, or one of the best
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI got this movie on DVD Christmas 2007.  It has become my favorite movie, I have watched it twice,  will watch many more times in future.  At the end of movie when the Stazi Captain is in the bookstore and the cashier asks him a standard question I cried at the response.  This movie is a masterpiece.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaDas Mittelalter war auf der ganzen Welt heftig. Wobei Holland im goldenen Zeitalter mal ziemlich gute Phasen hatte. ;-)
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaGuys, European movies seldom do the clear message for/against thing. It is a movie about people living under that regime and people who fought against communism. It is not a clear anti-communism movie and not really the point. 
What the director and actors/actresses wanted to do was to show the human side of all those people, on both sides. Ulrich M√ºhe grew up in DDR himself and was one of the intellectuals fighting against the regime so it was a matter of heart for him to do the movie. RIP
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI think you mean &quot;dub it&quot;
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI love German films. They have never disappointed me.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a question of authenticity. If it&#39;s not credible in the details, it&#39;s won&#39;t be in the overall picture either.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitathat was the movie that first got me into German movies, especially the ones that have to do with WWII. Netfilx rocks.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai guess the movie would have been much better with mullets then, right? if some banal hairstyle nitpicking is able to keep you from enjoying an excellent movie, go for it, then...
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaExcellent movie..
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAnd while I&#39;m at it: I expect some mullets, if &#39;80s are concerned.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaYou don&#39;t have to be an expert to notice such ignorance. Btw, I don&#39;t think East Germans had hairstyles specifically their own. But they surely didn&#39;t boast sleek, ironed-out Rihanna cuts.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThis is supposed to happen in the &#39;80&#39;s but the protagonists have post-2000 haircuts. I detest this kind of filmmaking.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIt is not true. There are many people in USA tired of the same flicks films that watch independent and foreign movies. I am from Colombia and live in USA. I tell you that there are many interesting smart and nice people in North America (yeah there are assholes too). well no all Colombians are drug dealers for example. we cannot judge people just by Nationality or Color.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe best phrase end ever. No it is for me moved me deeply
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIf you enjoyed this film please check a film from 1981, titled
&#39; Mephisto &#39;, with Klaus Maria Brandauer.  Roger Ebert refers to his performance as &quot; one of the greatest movie performances I&#39;ve ever seen &quot; and &quot; a performance of electrifying power &quot;.  He isn&#39;t exaggerating.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t flatter Richard Gere like that.  He&#39;s worse than &#39;pathetic&#39;.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe best film in the world!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitalol that is a little biased but it&#39;s pretty true. They call the US a melting pot of cultural ethnicity, meanwhile all it wants to do is to assimilate everyone into it&#39;s own &quot;culture&quot;.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThere will be blood for me was perfect
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshita2nd greatest film of the 21st Century.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the play that is referenced in this movie? What became of the playwrite that is the other hero of this movie? The lady factory in the play is supposed to be somekind of socialist hero of labor or what have you. Yet, she is shown as some kind of mystic w/ visions. It is very curious.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaDas stimmt nicht...wenn man mal sieht was im Mittelalter da ablief...es ist echt hart. Aber die Weltkriege sind numal die Krone auf allem...und ein Massenmord am eigenen Volk, das macht nicht jedes Land. Deutschland hat viel durchgemacht, und ich finde dieser Film zeigt einen kleinen Ausschnitt aus all dem schlimmen, was die Menschen erleben mussten.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaSUPERB, BRILIANT MOVIE!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI guess Joe the Plumber knows how it feels. The left is pounding him and those on the right in Hollywood for having a descenting voice against Obama.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaone of the best. (both concerning this movie and Ulrich M√ºhe)
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshita32nd greatest film of all time.

Best film of the 21st century.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIts indeed a great film. 

So sad that Ulrich M√ºhe passed away. He was a excellent actor.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThere is another interesting history film in the german theatres in these days, a story about the left wing terrorism in West Germany from 1967 - 1977
Der Baader Meinhof Komplex - a trailer is available on youtube.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaOh wait, there IS a scene where you see two main characters, a man and woman, having sex, but its kinda like flash backs, goes for 5 seconds, and you only see the top of their bodies (breasts
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this film, it was such beautifully made. Everyone should see this.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThere is one scene were a older man and woman are in a car, but all it shows is him unzipping his pants and moving towards her...
I would let my class watch it if they were about 15 year olds or older.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaDeutsche Geschichte beschr√§nkt sich nicht nur auf die Zeit von 1914- 1989. Da ist noch viel mehr zu entdecken, aber die Leute sind in ihrer Kurzsichtigkeit nur auf das 20. Jhd. fixiert.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie...germans history is very sad...
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Amerika today, I&#39;m going to watch it now. 

Great trailer.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai agree, the trailer is disappointing. but you should definitely watch it, it&#39;s one of the best political drama of all times, it really depicts what life was like in GDR
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitayou should definitely watch it.
but it is really a different movie. not full of action. you have to think a lot but if you wait and watch it until the end you will be rewarded. it draws a very realistic picture of the times in the GDR.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIve read so many great things about this film (Ebert anyone)...but this trailer doesnt look amazing, Im sure it doesnt do it justice...I will get around to watching it regardless of this (IMO) lackluster trailer...for those who have seen it, would you say this trailer does the film justice?
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAnd yes, the trailer is very disappointing. Does not represent the movie very well for me.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaIf you&#39;re interested in politics, the Cold War, the Soviet Union, human rights, the freedom of speech and opinion and the world of intelligence, any of these things, you must definitely watch this movie as soon as you can.

If not, I still think you should watch this movie anyway. That is how good I believe it is. Do not let the subtitles put you off. A subtitled version for English viewers is online on YouTube in 15 parts.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitathe trailer looks boring, should i watch this movie or what. HELP!!!!!!!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitanice that you think so.
i also watched the movie and i first thought it was boring, because i just watched &quot;Downfall&quot; one day before and there was more action ^^. after all this movie is different than others. it is calm, but intensive. yes, espacially the ending is what prices this movie. so my appeal to everyone: if you watch this movie and think at the beginning it could be boring, just watch it completely and notice every detail. it could help to reward you with a great ending of the story.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitathe actor not the character xD... that was funny anyway brother...
this is one of the best movies i&#39;ve seen in my life... it just blew me away... and what a perfect ending and soundtrack and performances... it really deserves his oscar and it was so much more better than the american films that year (except for Little Miss Sunshine that I love so much, but this movie is already a classic, which i couldn&#39;t say about LMS)
congratulations Germany and RIP Ulrich M√ºhe
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaGreat film. So sad that the leading actor died
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshita&quot;I think the film was clearly anti-communist.&quot;

then you didnt get it. read some books and watch it again kid.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie . I can&#39;t wait for the second movie of this Director!!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAmidst all the political banter here. I must say, what an incredibly outstanding film! Superbly acted and directed! Absolutely chilling, and stunningly powerful! One of the best I&#39;ve seen!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaJesus said righteousness would reign on Earth. There are some Christians who believe it still will do so. Just because Jesus&#39;s movement was usurped by Constantine and used to make war and genocide for nearly 2000 yrs doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that Jesus&#39;s followers were wrong. But Jesus never predicted, as Marx, that capitalism would immiserate the Earth&#39;s masses and eventually destroy itself. If Bush can call himself a republican, Stalin could call himself a communist and Hitler a socialist.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaJohn, you&#39;ve let fascists and Stalinists define for you what communism is. As for Hollywood &quot;leftists&quot;, these are well-meaning fake-left rad-libs. To find out what a Christian is, you don&#39;t defer to the Spanish Inquisitors or the Archbishop of Canterbury. Just so, you need to read Marx and Engels and their true followers,  especially Leon Trotsky, to find out what a communist is. I use the word &quot;communist&quot; in the sense THEY used it: the real Jesus and then some.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaVery good film!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaes ist einfach klasse...
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaexcellent Film. im german and i actually rooted for pans labyrinth at the oscars as i had seen it earlier in the cinema, buuut &quot;the lives of others&quot; well deserved the oscar. have u noticed? german movie making and international apreciation only works for our latest history.&quot;the downfall&quot; &quot;the good german (although a hollywood production) &quot;schindlers liste&quot; &quot; die f√§lscher&quot; and so on.. 
or how many if any german films would u know with other themes?
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaseriously.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAwarded Best Film 2007 because the stupid Academy thought it was anti-communist (it wasn&#39;t) and that El Laberinto del Fauno (actual best) was pro-communist (it was). Police hero struggles between commitment to defend the Stalinist DDR against the neo-fascist BRD and his human desire to protect artists from the corrupt Stasi secret police. Message of hope: even in the hearts of tyranny&#39;s most faithful professionals a spark of humanity resides which can grow into a beacon of universal brotherhood.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaomg u really didnt understand the movie
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaËøô‰∏™ÁîµÂΩ±‰πüË¢´ÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖöÂ∞ÅÊùÄÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe Stasi threatened to end her artistic career. That&#39;s the reason why she divulged the location of the secret stash.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe Stasi threatened to end her artistic career. That&#39;s the reason why she divulged the location of the secret stash.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaCan someone explain to me why Christa-Maria Sieland told the stasi about the typewriter???
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAlthough the story is fiction, the portrayal of the Stasi and the GDR system is dead-on.  My wife (then fiance) grew up in former East Berlin. She was interrogated by the Stasi more than once, simply because she was engaged to an American. She says the portrayal is so accurate the memories came rushing back after seeing it. An absolutely brilliant movie.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaTotally awesome movie, I live in Czech Republic a knew a lot of about this because of my parents. Now I&#39;m for a year in the US and i was talking about that with my host family and then they bought this movie. Hard to put it out of the head
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen the movie 3 times. It&#39;s extraordinary.

My question -- is it authentic?
Based on the awards the movie has received, I suspect that the movie is authentic.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaOr for someone from the usa :D
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshita-


Hani1989: Kleiner Schafskopf. Na sowas von bl√∂de...








.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaWell they do remakes of almost anything...

Godard&#39;s &quot;A Bout de Souffle&quot; (with Belmondo and Jean Seaberg) became &quot;Breathless&quot; with a pathetic Richard Gere.

And what a shitty flick THAT was..!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaNo ink in typewriters, but tapes!

Half red and half black tapes were standard in most of them.

I think Dreymann used a small Triumph
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitalast time I checked, Landmark Theaters and AMC Select show foreign films-they&#39;re movie chains right?  I would hope movie theaters have &#39;discovered&#39; Peoria as it has a population well over 300,000.  Flyover country enjoys some aspects of the culture praised on the two elite coasts.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThis has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The ending was absolutely incredible. Sorry to hear it&#39;s due to get the Hollywood treatment. Whoever decides to direct, act or score for that film will completely diminish in my eyes, even if I respected them before. A masterpiece like this should be kept intact.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaSorry for your troubles, but unfortunately it looks as if Hollywood will be getting its hands on this, a remake is planned!!  Throw in a few American actors, spice up the story line, a few gun fights and sure &#39;twill be a great movie!! &gt;:o/
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaJesus that&#39;s terrifying. For someone from Cuba, this film makes a powerful impression - the methods of the state security apparatus in both countries are so striking.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaVery strong film.  Top rate work of art.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitalove the film :D
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaO labirinto do Fauno merecia o pr√™mio!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitasaw this in english class, was a nice story.

im actually trying to learn german now.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitayeah ive noticed that he always walks like he has a purpose. 
maybe its because hes been trained to think like an inhuman, his emotions were suppressed and he has that built-in walk.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie! Do you, people, agree that Urlich Muhe looks and moves sometimes like Robert Patrick (T1000-robot) in the second part of Terminator? Not premeditated, of course.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAn interesting movie about the life of citizens in former East Germany, under the dominion of the ruthless and bloody communist regime.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is quite smashing, but this trailer sucks.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai know but its like were not even seeing an english film, were being forced to do this.
nyeh the trailer is nice though some german listing to people talk
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai have to watch this with my school.... we all groaned when my teacher said it was in german
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie last night! It is a great movie. The acting was superb and I am sad to hear that Ulrich M√ºhe passed away. From the looks of him in this movie, he was a great actor. RIP
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie and somehow I&#39;d like to believe this tale of a good human...
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer doesnt do it much justice, bloody excellent movie though! I think the very end is brilliant!! &quot;Do you want it gift wrapped?&quot;...&quot;no, its for me&quot;, haha, class!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaein sehr sch√∂ner film. zurecht, dass er einen oscar bekommen hat.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t think that the main idea of the movie is this - lives of others - i&#39;d rather say it is about people &amp; what they can change into : how much GOOD and how much BAD they can do . All in all ... it really is a great movie and i think that the one who said that it was boring , didn&#39;t see it untill the end.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie isnt boring you idiot. It was such a good movie. Your probably too immature too understand the movie because it was not boring at all.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is not deep. It is very boring.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaUlrich Muhe is so fit!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaVery similar in its brilliance to Brazil, Big Brother prevails everywhere.. GDR seemed so beautiful in comparison with West Berlin. What a movie tho !!, jez. 21.5 out of 21
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaAnd Sebastian Koch! He&#39;s just wonderful, and I&#39;m smitten with the character he portrays in this movie. Men, listen up - we need a few more Georgs in the world!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaOne of our theaters is in the middle of an indie series, so I just saw it on the big screen today. &quot;Mercilessly gripping&quot; is the best description I&#39;ve seen, especially remember this all happened during my lifetime(or is it still happening? Can we say &quot;Patriot Act&quot;?). Wonderful story and performance!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaA really excellent film! Especially the actors!
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaThis is an absolutely amazing film! Germany is really beginning to give the world some very good movies, this and Der Untergang just to give examples. I love Sebastian Koch! He has such expressive eyes, and M√ºhe is chilling and pitiful as the stasi agent.
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitai watched it today great film , though i would like for some one to upload the part where the woman got hit by the car
n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitagood film!

n3_iLOp6IhMdelimeterByIshitaGREAT film!!!

zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaDenzel in my eyes is about the only decent person in Hollywood. I did dream about 3 years ago I was told to read The Book of Isaiah, it‚Äôs a hard read. After watching this movie I‚Äôm goin to reread it. Maybe it‚Äôs God‚Äôs way of telling me it‚Äôs time.

Many people went missing and it was scarce to find someone who lives during the time before. Food and water is extremely hard to find. And it seems, there are no christians, expect Eli.<br><br>The only thing that makes this not able to be the tribulation period is the lentgh of the years. The tribulation period is only 7 years. but this(to my understandiny is 30). I feel like this movie vould definitely be based off of that without realization.
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaWish it wasn&#39;t shot in sepia filter or whatever  that is. Gives me the heebie jeebies.

zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaCarnegie was soooo right!!<br>That weapon saved me and my family, and still does His amazing job!!<br>Reload it everyday if you have the bless of having one
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why anyone would want to just like this video. It was an amazing movie I literally actually just finished it finally....
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaSuch a good film
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaThis film is impeccable. It has a serious feel appeal to it. I can  hardly describe adequately .<br>It absolutely brings to life the intense dread of the scriptures,that convey the coming of the Christ. Point to note, is that the power can be truly felt in this film
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaThe comments are full of spoilers, tread carefully.
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaa lot of people don&#39;t know the 2 twins who made the movie&quot; menace to society&quot;made this one  .amazing shit
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaThis is fallout :/
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaDO NOT FORGET IT IS ONLY A FILM TO ENTERTAIN US NOT TRUE OF COUSE<br>THE POINT IS MANY PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS IF IT WERE ATRUE STORY
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaHE IS JUST HIS BELOVED SON WHO WAS CREATED FROM THE BEGINNING AND WHO OFFERED HIMSELF IN SACRIFICE TO REDEEM US  FROM DEAD BECAUSE  GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE FOR GOD DID NOT SENT HIS SON INTO THE WORLD TO CONDEMN THE WORLD BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD THROUGH HIM
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitafuck you üòí
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaDafuq! 6 year s later i see on netflix
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t the fact that it was the Bible was a twist? And here in the trailer, they show the Bible when he talks about his book? What a spoiler.
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaMORGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaFinally! A fallout movie starring Morgan from the walking dead!
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitahe looks like the guy from tekken
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaEvery one keeps telling me to watch but I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t....
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitalol this trailer gave away the entire movie. glad I didn&#39;t see it beforehand
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitalove this line up
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorites and really wish there were sequels to it like a comic series or another movie. And yes I mean sequels as in pre-quels since Eli dies in the end of this. Who agrees with me?
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaCOOLEST POST APOCALYPTIC ATMOSPHERE EVER!!!! wish there was a game exactly the same as this (not fallout 3 &#39;cause its so overrated and to me its just tedious)
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaI never worked out why he didnt kill that bitch also along with those 6 men at the beginning. ¬†Cut that bitch into pieces and be done!
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitathis is why Denzel should be in The Walking Dead lmao
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshita: The Book of ELI :<br>ELI....Eloha(Armaik) ..Elohim(Hebrew).....Elaha(Persian)...Allah(arabic)<br>.<br>So...the book of Allah...does it mean..the CURAN....not the Bible<br>.<br>However..the Movie is awsome....!!!
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitaA brilliant Film!
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitagood :)
zSMHmtaoXtIdelimeterByIshitabut that its the feature and i do all for it dont hapens.

K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaLol it&#39;s Marshall!
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this right now.... curse you homework..
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s just ironic 
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Spelt&quot; and &quot;Spelled&quot; are both acceptable, dumbass.
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaYou spelled spelled wrong.
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaI hate this movies I get so many comments on this 

K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny cuz his name&#39;s Marshall
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a stupid movie ..
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitahey marshall.lily is waiting home.
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshita2:25 .. :D .. DAT ACCENT! :D
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaIron man 3
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaand you spelt comment wrong
K4xD8ZMdJmsdelimeterByIshitaFirst commet
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThat might be true, but they&#39;re never &quot;horrible&quot; movies. I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t go into making the film expecting Oscars or nominations for Best Romance Movie.

It probably serves its purpose as a Friday night date movie and nothing more. Right now Nicolas Sparks has decent stories that aren&#39;t romcoms or ultra dramatic romance (Revolutionary Road, etc) that young people like. Watched a couple with my girlfriend...I&#39;ve seen plenty worse.

Better these movies than Twilight, if I had to choose.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI feel like the movie&#39;s gonna be a bit different. Katie in the book was shy, closed, scared that Kevin might find her, she kept Alex away for a long time, this one has a tan, smiles a lot, and that day on the beach, Katie from the book didn&#39;t want to wear a bikini. The one from the movie isn&#39;t exactly like a woman who&#39;s on the run from a husband who used to beat her badly. 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThe cops aren&#39;t looking for her, she ran away from her abusive husband. It&#39;s kinda like Sleeping With the Enemy.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone no y katie ran away?? Like y r the cops looking for her??
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitayou can knock it all you want.. but it&#39;ll make tons of money.  If you really have a problem with it come up with something better yourself.  But I guess everyones entitled to their own opinion. 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaFurthermore it&#39;s a cover of a Fleetwood Mac song by Lindsey Buckingham in 1976. It&#39;s been covered about 24 times. This is one of them.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaHay da 411 -Itz Lissie - Go Your Own Way -&amp;itz in da foregrond lotzaSumtimze: [ ]
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitabecause they make money lol girls love them
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThey might be similar; but everyone still loves them, don&#39;t you?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaHey, Doz Any1 Knw Da Name Of Da Song PlayN In Da BackGround? :)
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitagreat movie from Nickolas Sparks.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaKids, it&#39;s your Aunt Robin! 1:47
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitahave to see this
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitalol

p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI so envy you!!!!! 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita&quot;soupy in romance and overly dramatic&quot; you said it!!! 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaLissie is singing this song.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know who is singing Go Your Own Way in this trailer? Is it Stevie Nicks doing a stripped down version or a completely different artist? Loving it no matter what!!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThis is  my favourite Nicholas Sparks book. I hope the movie will be as interesting as the book - even with the differences. :)
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThe book was amazing. I just hate seeing the little things that are different. Katie is supposed to have short brown hair and Alex grayish hair :&#39;( I really hope they dont show them sleeping together in the movie because that didnt happen at all!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like the Julia Roberts movie &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot; where she moves to a rural town to get away from her abusive ex husband but he finds her anyway.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita@CLTMONKEY Me, too! :)
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita@ripcurlgrl14 Yeah. Again :)
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaLissie - Go your own way
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaMy god. She is so beautiful!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaHave you read them?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie : She walks away, she don&#39;t love him , she love him, She walks away, she love him and live in peace .
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitabecause kissing in the rain never gets old in a chick-flick.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaRobin..wtf??!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaWhat is it with Nicholas Sparks always telling the same stories? He uses the same formula every time. This film seems like a retelling of The Lucky One, The Last Song and The Notebook. 1:29 looks exactly like scene in The Notebook....
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitawell..at least josh duhamel is pretty 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI actually really like Julianne Hough! I think her acting in many roles that Ive seen her in make her seem realistic.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThis one&#39;s got a different thing on it. I&#39;ve read the book, and it&#39;s far more different than what Sparks have written (tragic deaths, cancer). Though it&#39;s always soupy in romance and overly dramatic.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitayou&#39;d better believe that every teenage girl and their boyfriend see this film opening weekend. They make loads off this. Plus they get royalties from the book, soundtrack, dvd sales. 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaOk one reason to watch this movie is cobie smulders and josh duhamel, cuz he&#39;s smokin&#39;.. But other than that its one the worst nicholas sparks movies (or at least trailer) ever. The actress who plays katie is beyond awful.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a girl named Lissie and the song title is &quot;You can go your own way&quot; :) SO good! 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitait is the song but someone else in the trailer is singing it, i don&#39;t know who&#39;s singing it in the trailer sorry :/  if i do ill tell you
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaOhMyGod I&#39;m soooooo excited about this movie!
The book was awesome!!!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t Robin a lead actress yet?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI wanna live in the places where Nicholas Sparks movies are shot.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaBecause they continue to generate fantastic profits essentially.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see it. It was filmed here in my home town. i love where i live and so glad that we are able to have movies filmed here.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaas far as the box office goes, do nicolas sparks movies even go that great??
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita@whor3crux well if you have actually read the books you would know that&#39;s not true...
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita@moviedude1500 I see what you mean. However the movie might seem cliche but unless you have read the book and other sparks books you really wouldn&#39;t know.. Maybe some elements are cliche but things like kissing in the rain are just classic romance, the overall plot is very original and interesting.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! I&#39;ve always loved Nicholas sparks books! Perfect if it&#39;s made into movie(: no matter how similar they are, there&#39;s gotta be some difference in them. So peeps, let&#39;s stop judging and enjoy every bit of it(: xoxo peace!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitamore like 1:39 :P
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitasure doesnt sound like that song... so you dont know the song from the trailer?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaread the book, she barely eats properly once she gets to southport
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI read safe haven a few years ago, it&#39;s very sad at the end

p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaAs a Single guy and Aspiring Lover im definitely seeing this Love Aunt Robin and Colonel Lennox!!:D 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaits go your own way by fleetwood mac but the one in the trailer sorry
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitawhats the song called ?? 
LOOKS SO GOOD!
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s Lissie&#39;s cover version
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita sp4rt4n058 no irony here.. lol.. these are all shallow movies,, not realistic..same lame story too.. two good looking people find each other.. etc etc.. lame lame lame.. and like i said real women have curves.. not some skinny twig who is scared to eat lol. and Josh can&#39;t act lol..   Juliana is a horrible singer and dancer
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI can see a little bit of notebook and of dear john haha 
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaWhy did they have to put #savehaven throughout the whole trailer?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s singing the cover of You Can Go Your Own Way?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaIS THAT AUNT ROBIN I SEE?
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Julianne Hough from Footloose (Remake) 2011 and Josh Duhamel from Transformer (All 3 movies) I can&#39;t wait for February 8 2013.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitayeahh, he must work out.
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaThe irony is great with this one
p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshita..so tired of shallow movies..   she is too skinny for my taste,, real women have curves :)

p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaomg i read this book and said it should be a movie! it was an amazing book, never been more excited for a film before!

p4vhm3_-3VMdelimeterByIshitaI read the book, It was amazing. Can&#39;t wait until the movie!!!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI know this is silly but i was kinda bummed out when &quot;The Way I Are&quot; wasn&#39;t featured in the party scene in the actual movie lol üòÑnowadays someone would probably try and sue a movie studio for not including that piece of music in ü§£ü§£
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe Mist üå´Ô∏è 2007 Film is very similar to Cloverfield, mysterious things happening outside, terrified people want to find out
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaHearing Cloverfield be referred to as a classic makes me want to just shrivel up and die.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaLotta people don&#39;t know they changed the size of the head of the Statue of Liberty for the movie. In this trailer its right around the ACTUAL size of the real thing (close to the size of a big SUV) .... but people complained it looked to small because most think the SoL is much bigger than it is. In the movie they increased its size by 50%.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this before Transformers and all I did was think about this trailer through the whole movie lol
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaToday&#39;s the 15th anniversary! This movie is still cool! I hope they still do a fourth movie and bring back Rob and Beth since in other media, they reveal they&#39;re still alive. And I heard they might have the two meet Michelle and Ava from the other movies. If that does happen, I hope they bring back Lily too.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaMy local theater had to put signs up that the film could cause motion sickness because people were getting ill due to the rapid movement of the handheld camera for most of the film.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m waiting for a sequel to this film. Watched it 50 times in a row and words cannot even begin to describe how awesome this film is.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaClover&#39;s Roar at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a> Kinda Sounds Like Jackie The Lion from the Early 20&#39;s MGM Logo&#39;s
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaWhoa, they really did show just enough
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaNobody really died
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSeeing this in cinema was crazy. Haha.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitahm, this trailer is way brighter then the actual film
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis just makes me want to watch it again.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaPregnant Girl vs Kaiju in Another World
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaweird
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI love the whole build up in this film.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThose roars seemed to be cut from the movie, even though we all knew there was a giant monster in it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> didn&#39;t have those and in my opinion, it makes these scenes more unexpected and chilling.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita1-18-08
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThat monster sound is by far one of the best massive monster sound roars/effects imho!!! The tension and chaos auickly developing üòç
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe online marketing campaign for this movie that took place from the release of this teaser in 2007 to the release of the movie in 2008 was something on a whole nother level you had to be there. Everyone on online forums trying to figure out what the monster was analyzing every clue on the pictures released in the website every month. Everyone guessing it was Voltron at first because the teaser was attached to Transformers loool.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSounds like Ukraine
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be the best night ever.‚Äù <br>Perfect way to end this trailer
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaA metaphor of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù as a monster in 2008, 7 years after 9/11 and now a seeming monster movie 14 years after its release.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSo my biggest question is how is the cameraman going to survive without Rob lol
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is still so badass and mysterious, even after the film released years ago.<br><br>I swear, this movie is incredibly underrated.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI watched it when I was 10 and my parents hated me for picking out this boring movie.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSo, its just Godzilla?
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> it will forever haunt my mind
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaDP
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a> hey when did that happen,  I didn&#39;t noticed that happening, in mine the main char. was outside talking with his bro and then the blast came
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaüéµIf you liked it, then you should&#39;ve put some green on it. Ho ho ho, ho ho ho! üéµ
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSince 2008 Cloverfield is still my favorite monster flim and I cant wait for the direct sequel
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaKiev
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita&quot;It&#39;s a lion!  It&#39;s huge!&quot; = confirmed live-action Voltron adaptation
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaStill a great film. I remember when it first came out people complained that it was unrealistic for someone to be holding a camera and filming while all of this crazy stuff was going on. But now we see people filming with their phones and taking selfies all the time, even during dangerous or risky situations, so it&#39;s not so unbelievable. We even see people voluntarily heading into dangerous situations with phones or cameras just so they can &quot;document&quot; the experience. Cloverfield was kind of ahead of its time in that regard.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaAwesome ending.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaTo this day...we are still waiting for the sequel!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaCloverfield is one of my favorite video footage/Monster Movie ever and I like this movie too so much.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was lowkey kinda whack
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=0m19s">0:19</a> they must have removed that song from the movie
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this in the movie theaters as a 16 y/o and walking out of the cinema with a raging migraine because of the camerawork lol
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis is how an Attack on Titan live action movie should be done. Loved this movie.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaA really good movie, it was just weird how the monster seemed to follow the cast literally everywhere they went...like New York isn&#39;t that damn small. But I know...had to move the plot forward!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis scared the hell out of me in theaters as a kid
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaIm telling my kids this was the COVID-19 pandemic
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d say outta all the &quot;found footage&quot; films, excluding the OG Blair Witch of course, Cloverfield &amp; Quarantine/Rec were my favorites!!!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaFantastic movie! So much about this movie makes it so thrilling.The atmosphere is filled with tension and we dont know what is going to happen some minutes after.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaIronic the trailer ended just like the movie
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a>
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaWhen the trailer is better than the movie.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitathey cut out roars? why???? Smh mh head!!!!!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita2021 is here and pentagon confirming ufos
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else actually love this movie?
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitathe first 30 seconds of this trailer might be the most 2008 thing i&#39;ve ever seen
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a>
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaPETE
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaOh my god!!!!!!! Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaAn actual movie where even god can&#39;t save the camera man
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI wish movie trailers were like this and kept us guessing
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie worst camerman forever totally waste of time
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaHere after hearing that the sequel of this movie is in the works.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI watched this
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI was wondering when Lily was gonna take off her shoes. She got too far in those shoes. I would of died lol.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI just found out that the statue of liberty head was sized up due to complaints of it being too small in this trailer. And now I can&#39;t unsee this.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaIt just went from 1 to 100 real quick
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI was so obsessed with this movie before it came out, going online every day to find out what the monster was. :&#39;)
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis could only happen on 30th December 2020.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis Director will be Directing The upcoming Batsy movie starring sparkle boy from TwilightüòÇ
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitais this house m.d
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll tell my future kids this is a real documentary
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitathought this was 10 Cloverfield Lane <br><br>( like the titles are not confusing enough! ) <br><br>watched it anyway
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaBlair Witch meets Godzilla
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitadoesn&#39;t matter how much you admire ultra budget movies,<br>but somthing inside you always crave for movies like<br>V.H.S , REC etc.<br>very few left , and idk we&#39;ll se these in future or not.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe camera man is not save because the camera man is a baby‚Äôs vision
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe best film to feature such an unlikeable cast of characters.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita2008 was such an awesome year
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaJanuary 18th 2008
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this for the first time when it played before Transformers. I was so sure it was a Godzilla film
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaOnly thing that bugged me was how small the Statue of Liberty&#39;s head looked when it&#39;s really big enough to fit people in.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaIs it me?! Or the first scenes look like 9/11 attacks but at night! Exactly how everyone gets in the store when the dust is coming. Even people with dust in them and the screams and all the running.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI remember this trailer played before Transformers 1 and it was a blessed experience!!! The audience was hyped!!! It was amazing!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe director of this movie is directing The Batman next year. ü¶á
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaMonsters in here came from the Cloverfield Paradox?
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m24s">1:24</a> -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a> are one of the best monster sounds. It would be awsome to use that same audio for a movie concept of a chosen Human to battle behemoth goliath that is laying waste to earth. And through science and transdimensional abilities this hero steps up and does battle, but thenmovie is filmed from the horrified citizens POV and this hero is duking it out sonehow with the behemoth, but they are at such a standstill becuase the monster is not only fighting our hero, but also terroizing and obliterating everything in it&#39;s wake, but this sound comes in as the hero is just getting pummelled for pissing it off. Anyways that what the sounds takes me to....
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThe only movie where cameraman is also not safe üòÖüòÖüòÖ
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaHonestly the part where the statue of libertys head came crashing down it looked like one person could fit in it, when in actuality its big enough for a whole group of tourists to fit in the crown
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is nostagic
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afPFLvh2qg&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> I&#39;ve seen that dude on Bones
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSigh. Back when cloverfield was actually a mystery.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaI threw up watching the first 30 min of the movie no joking lol<br> the camera work killed me
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaHEY! Did you forget something? The... TITLE? You forgot the title of your movie! How could you forget the title of your movie?!? <b>What kind of a ripoff is that???</b>
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely a top 10 found footage film of all time.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaStar trek teaser debuted with this movie.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaAh the good ol&#39; days.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite monster movie!
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Looks like you should&#39;ve left town a little bit earlier.&quot;<br>Sir, you are down right <i>English</i> in your knack for understatement.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaSequel officially happening.
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshitaGot my vote as top 10 worse movie ever
_afPFLvh2qgdelimeterByIshita&quot;From producer J.J. Abrams. In theaters January 18, 2008.&quot;
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaOne of Keanu and Patrick&#39;s best films! I can&#39;t believe someone actually had the nerve to make a 2010&#39;s hipster remake of this classic.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaüëçüåéride the wave üåä
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaSam wheat vs John wick
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaMovie should have been called &quot;Rad Bromance&quot;.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaThere was a tv spot one where Patrick says &quot;100% pure adrenaline&quot;  I loved that line. Bodhi had excellent dialogue throughout the film.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaKeanu Reeves and Gary Busey, buddy cops, still cant believe it to this day. An amazing character Bodhi, def. not the worste char. in the movie. Fav scene Angelo Pappas shoves that crazy woman&#39;s head against the wall. He did some of the things Utah just couldn&#39;t.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaPlease make a 30 years later video and Keanu is retired and they meet on a beach in another country surfing
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaI love the 1991‚Äôs original over the 2015‚Äôs remake. No offense in anyway.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshita<i>This</i> is a Disney-owned feature, now.  Think about that.
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good movie, but I didn&#39;t like seeing Patrick Swayze as the villain AFTER Red Dawn, Roadhouse, Next Of Kin.  <br><br>I always thought they should have used someone else to play his part. <br><br>Kinda like catching Santa Claus snorting coke and punching Mrs. Claus in the mouth. JMHO
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaEven if I didn&#39;t like the. Film Patrick.   S. Is in it sooo I watch it and watch bit and watch it
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaLove it movie üçø about this movie back then I was going over 24year old now and 55 years old now
ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaYou guys are going to love this movie

ZgHPumVN4FodelimeterByIshitaFirst
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was weird, creepy, beautiful and deep and I LOVED IT!!!!! I miss this kind of Cinema!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaAfter watching this trailer I have no idea what this movie is about. Just one random unrelated scene after the other. If you want someone to watch your movie, shouldn&#39;t your trailer catch the attention on imagination of the person watching, not confuse them?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaDamn this was a good film. So good and didn‚Äôt have too many effects. Almost was like one of those Sundance films but just super amazing without trying. It caused every bit multiple feelings in this which is how it‚Äôs supposed to be. Never felt creeped and mesmerized at the same time.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer kinda ruins lots of key moments and shots. I hope you didn&#39;t watch this trailer before seeing the film.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMerci Levi&#39;s soundtrack brings thi movie to lifeüò© 10/10 movie
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get this film? why? what is the narrative? but i will give A24 the benefit of the doubt because I have loved more of their films
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaWhat scared me the most was when the guy stuck in the blackness got his body slurped out and his skin was like cloth. üò±üò±
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThe weirdest movie I have ever seen .
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThe first time I watched this, I felt kinda bored. 6-7 viewings later, I‚Äôm fully entertained.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll admit...i like the movie and its minimalism. It seems almost realistic in its tone and plot (minus the fantastical and what happens once she arrives in the woods). All in all, would reccomend.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is far more scarier than most horror movies.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaIs this related to Her and Lucy?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaTrash
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s kind of the bad way for this lead character to turn into a skin culture.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshita&quot;Bizarre&quot;
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitathat was messy.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaWatched this movie yesterday (well, actuallay only some parts of this movie) and don&#39;t understand a thing
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitase va a caer se va a caer el patriarcado se va a caer
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitait is movie for gay. watch other movie actress hide nothing.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis was such a beautiful film! I thought I just finished watching an unreleased Kubrick film.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaListen, this move was extremely avant-garde, so I&#39;m not going to cover plot, dialogue richness, or narrative cohesion.  This movie is extremely thematic and wants to make a point, so that is what I want to focus on.  If you want wall to wall entertainment, it will be a chore to watch.  However if you enjoy exploring big ideas with big visual gambles, then get popcorn and press play.   <br><br>This movie is about feminine identity through and through.  One of the ways in which the director makes us explore feminine identity is by giving men a disturbing equality with full frontal nudity.  It was horrifying, but that is supposed to be your reaction after being shielded from that visual since the inception of movies.  Women are to be ornamental, whereas men have always had their reproductive organs shielded in an almost reverential religious awe.  <br><br>There is also a recurring theme of the male chaperones.  While I fully understand she is baiting men to sink into a black resin in order to harvest their innards, the optics are clear, she is not to be without male presence.  Either a man finds her, or she finds one.  There is a perennial male figure that appears as if he is overseeing her operations.  Every other man is drawn forward by libidinal motivation.  Some are kind others are predatory, but all lust after her.    There is a scene in which a group of party going women scoop up Scarlett Johansson&#39;s nameless character (table that) into a club.  She is absolutely ill at ease.  She looks hesitant even slightly panicked.  She tries to escape and is only restored to calm when a suitor tries to buy her a drink.  She eventually lures him back into her lair in which she secures another body. <br><br>This lair of Johansson&#39;s is all black.  This is alluding to the ignorance surrounding true female identity.  Female identity is portrayed as mysterious, backward moving (important), manipulative, predatory, and ultimately dangerous to men.   I don&#39;t believe the director is saying this is what true female identity is, rather this is the societal representation.   There are only two qualities that interest me.  The backward movement and the blackness.  <br><br>To be fair let us quickly cover manipulation and an underhanded predatory nature.   She is in literally &quot;the driver&#39;s seat&quot; for most of the movie, that is to say seemingly in control.  What is the outcome, deceit and treachery.  Put women in charge and they will destroy you.  Okay that&#39;s good enough.  <br><br>Now let&#39;s get back to backward movement. This was a conscious decision.  The lure would have worked just as well if she moved forward away from the man occasionally looking over her shoulder.  The backward movement is important because she does this BY HERSELF as she looks in the mirror.  You know something is important when it has a call back.  She looks at her naked body and begins to walk back.  Why is this important.  This is how many feminist try to recover female identity.  They ponder to themselves, &quot;What was I before I bore children, before I got married, before I had sex, before, I was given a name?&quot;  This regressive hunt for identity is nested the assigned identity as sexual object.  In the middle of her job, she wonders who is she really.  This is the constant motif of mirror gazing.  <br><br>Sex is the sticking point of female identity.  She uses it to lure men.  She hypnotizes with it, that is until she is confronted with the primary utility of the act itself in which case she freaks out.  There is a disconnect between her subversive power over sex attraction, and the functionality of sex itself.  It is no coincidence that she is on bottom.  This missionary position is performed by a caring man and also with the cruel rapist. In the actual act, be it with a kind man securing consent, or a rapist without mercy, she understands actual sex is a losing proposition.  She looses in the game of being gotten.   There is a ambiguous relationship she has with her body.  It is a source of her power and simueltaneous the cause of her mental and physical domination.    <br><br>The second truth is the mysterious quality represented by pitch black.  I spoke about how the room played to her mystic, but her inward image of jet black is an admission of women being a puzzlement to their own eyes.  This mystery does not inspire poetry, affection, or exploration, it encourages violence as was played out when she was burned alive.  Past the prospect of sex, there seems to be an unfeeling from men, even a fright.   She is punished for not being what she was conditioned to be, and the smoke of her torment goes up to heaven is a black ashy cloud.  <br><br>One more quick observation.  I&#39;m sure there is a thing about eating disorders with the chocolate cake, but there is not enough for me to make that connection.   Thought provoking stuff.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis was the worst movie i have ever watched, don&#39;t watch it people!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaGits vibes
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaBasically its a movie about an Alien beings, if u count the guy on the motor bike, who need human skin to blend in with human beings. But after a while the human skin leads her to a process of self-discovery. It&#39;s a real dark sci-fi that keeps u thinking..
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaEsta clar√≠simo de que se trata
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaSeriously waste of the time this trash. There was darude sandstrom at least...
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is brilliant
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaIf you looking for a movie that fucks your mind, Under the Skin is a good choice.<br>And if you wanna see Scarlett Johansson naked, this is the best choice.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaOne thing is for certain, you will either dig it or not.  My experience with Aliens is that their behavior is totally foreign to any logic, reason or form of understanding known to mankind.  The films attempts to bring the audience into this odd paradigm and I cannot say if it succeeded or failed.  Depends on whom you ask.  Kubrick and Lynch come to mind a bit and as well as a few other Directors.  Kudos for the attempt at expanding the unified energy field.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI have¬†just seen this film on DVD. I don`t want ¬†give any coments.¬† I can only¬†highly recomend everyone to see it.¬†This is just stunning.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaArguably the worst film I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m not going into details because it&#39;s worthless, total piece of crap. Sorry Scarlet, love ya tho.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaJohansson portayed a great roles: a special agent and a member of a team called the Avengers (Natasha/Black widow), an alien seductress who is disgused as a human (Laura), a single person who gains superhuman Powers by a strange drug (Lucy), a Cyborg cop who is hunting down criminals in a futuristic Japan (motoko/major).
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitagreat story,worst actress.but still maintaining her hotness
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaIs the actress the same who plays in Lucy?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitado you guys have trouble understanding the Scottish? accent  in the film? I needed the subtitles
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaBleak, disturbing, genius.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaEasily the most boring and stupid movie I have probably ever seen. Had the last hour and half of it on fast forward to get to the end.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI frankly like the trailer better than the movie, lol. At least, there was Scarlet Johansson...yep.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaScarlett beautiful
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has one redeeming factor. Scarlett Johansson gets naked in it.     Alot.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaYup, Pewds did recommend this
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMost hard-ons I&#39;ve seen in a non-pornographic movie...
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaWow!<br>Scarlett Johansson<br> she is so damn beautiful ...
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaDieser Film ist mehr als verst√∂rend ... und ich habe schon<br>viele wilde Filme gesehen ... aber ¬ªUnder The Skin¬´ hat<br>mich schwerst irritiert. <br><br><br>Ein Schock, nur noch mit ¬ªClockwork Orange¬´ <br>von anno dunnemals vergleichbar ...
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so similar to the stories Eulalia and In The Sky of Dreaming. I recommend them. They&#39;re in pdf online. Deeply disturbing.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaCheap numb movie
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaIt was amazing
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitathe firest 10 minutes of this movie is the camera panning out of an eye and it&#39;s weird af
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaShes just an alien that has sex with ppl........
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMight be a perfect movie.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaim so confused but this is art
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitai seen this movie scarlett johansson is great
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitablimey! they are not giving anything away are they? all i got from this trailer is Scarlett is starring
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea at all what this movie is all about, the trailer is just so like HUH?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck is this.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie I&#39;ve ever seen,no question
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaEx Machina is 1,000 times better than this piece of crap
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaHUH????
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis was MORE disturbing than the novel was. It kept me asking questions that I did not ask when I read the novel. I was not prepared for the end.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaüëΩ<br>¬†x
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie gay as fuk
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaBarely any info. about the movie . So it incurage&#39;s me to wonder if I should even watch it .
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThought it was a really good thoughtful alien movie. Good Show!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest films I have seen (It&#39;s not supposed to have much dialog).
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThe thing is. We are not used to films where you need to think. It`s not obvious enough and therefore we say &quot;i don`t get it&quot;.<br>It simply is too good to be pop...<br>For those who don`t get it, go and whatch Fast and Furious 13 or something....
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitawho like this film he CANT be normal
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI came for Horror.<br><br>Not porn.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really not understand this movie..
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaTHE COLOR OF FIRE<br><br>CURTI A√ç QUE ESSE √â DOS MEUS...<br>MUITO LEGAL... AL√âM DOS EFEITOS ESPECIAS, TEM UM TOM MISTERIOSO E ROM√ÇNTICO... EX√ìTICO E FUTURISTA...<br><br>&quot;DRAGON NO FEAR&quot;<br>( MIGUEL MATTOS ) ¬†
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so stupid, It&#39;s like watching something made by a 12yo that&#39;s already used to killing puppies and has no idea of what&#39;s going on the world.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaOne of the very worst movies I have ever seen. Even with S.J. in it. Just plain boring all the way through plus 80 percent there was no dialog the other 20 percent was with such a thick accent you could not understand what they were saying.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitamagnificent, imaginative, startling, and completely original. ¬†it&#39;s a instant classic!!!!!!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis may be a financial failure but it is a creative triumph. All time classic.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaFollows the book VERY loosely but probably worth a watch if you enjoy things avant-garde.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitajust seen this film and I gotta say it was excellent...one of the most disturbing films ive ever seen...Johansson was brilliant in it as an alien wearing johanssons skin as a suit...the harvesting scenes really creeped me out...the scene where Johansson is totally naked in front of the mirror was a brilliant piece of acting...not once did I think my god that&#39;s scarlett johanssons body....for me the alien was like a woman in a clothes shop changing room checkin out her new clothes...or the alien looking at what its like to be a human woman...this film was a brilliant disturbing look at the sci-fi genre....
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so weird... I like it but man you gotta be really creative to really understand this film. Like you gotta pull out your inner artist. This is what a movie would be like if it was directed by Pablo Picasso¬†
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitalooks like wrf
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaS√≥ vi o video por causa do MRG!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI take it she lores them back to her house and skins them! ¬†
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaVim pelo MRG pra ver a Scarlett Johansson Nua Aeeeeew
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaA work of art!!!!!!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaUnder my Foreskin baby!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant!¬† One of Scarlett Johansson&#39;s best performances since &#39;Lost in Translation.&#39;
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaWatching this,,.reminds me of drawing restraint 9
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaEsta pel√≠cula esta estupenda para verla y analizar
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMmmmm, Scarlett.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaSpecies type genre
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaAnother incomprehensible trailer and likely a stinker at the box office.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitafinally a trailer that doesnt give away the plot
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaMust.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7bAZCOk0Sc&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> WHERE THE BOOBS ARE GONE?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitahow can I get to watch this??
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaI had this uneasy feeling while watching this trailer. It&#39;s looks very interesting
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaSoooo... Species?
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaLo unico que me deja en claro el trailer es que actua Joason, pero ni la mas puta idea de que mierda trata el film. Lo bajare de TPB cuando salga un BDRip.
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great!
J7bAZCOk0ScdelimeterByIshita....something to live for
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaHowd i miss this movie...ohio train derailment...jj abrams...steven spielberg...whats wrong with me
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaJust normal movie that took place in Ohio

Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was a huge part of my movie journey. So glad to see people talking about how much they still love it
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaMost underrated sci-fi film ever
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThis really captured that 80s vibe. I would not be surprised if Stranger Things took inspiration from this movie.
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThe prequel to Stranger Things. 4 years and 1 state over

Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThat man still alive after crashed by train... Thats miracles üòÇ
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaWATCH IT RIGHT NOW
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThis was too ahead of its time. If it was released today, it would‚Äôve had the same success as the Mission Impossible saga.
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaStranger things before stranger things existed üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaSuper 8 turns 10 today!<br>I remember seeing it with my sister <br>J.J. Abrams did a really good job with Steven Spielberg making a love letter to film, childhood and 1980s adventures <br>Lots of nods to E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but mostly Cloverfield<br>The anxieties of growing up, the heartache of young love, the sorrow of broken families, and the wonder of what‚Äôs lurking out there in the night sky are core tenets straight out of the Spielberg playbook<br>Also paved the way for the pop culture trend from Stranger Things to IT <br>These characters are given true development <br>The plot is a bit shaky and some of the melodrama could&#39;ve been cut down <br>But the train crash is the best set piece in the whole film <br>With the giant monster I like how a lot of it is kept a mystery and you actually sympathize with it as a result of being mistreated by humanity <br>Elle Fanning can act <br>It&#39;s cool too that this event brings a father and son closer together still rising from a tragedy <br>An example of good ol fashioned summer popcorn entertainment <br>Abrams made it as a response to iconic movies making his own mythos
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite part about this movie is the train crash
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaspooky movie
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this in Portal 2
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Super 8&quot;(2011) is a good enough adventure sci-fi movie!
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaStranger Thiings got the inspiration from this movie.
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaExcellent trailer and movie üôÑüôÑüôÑ horror villain
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaIn a little over than six months from now this movie will be celebrating its 10th anniversary. Pretty insane it&#39;s been that long since the movie was released. And after watching the trailer it honestly made me feel a little bit nostalgic because I was 10 when I saw this in the theater and I&#39;m just weeks away from being 20.
Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually made in my town, it‚Äôs the only reason I know it exists lol.

Yo4d8uHsxXwdelimeterByIshitaBefore stranger things there was super 8.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaMy poor childhood book, what have they done to you
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaChina knows all about harmony
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaEquilibrium :)¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaEugh.<br>Not only does this look like a bad version of Equilibrium but the music they used in this trailer is so over-used it actually put me off seeing this.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaDo they have the right to use the &quot;REQUIEM FOR A DREAM&quot; sound track?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaWow, this REALLY makes me mad. They&#39;re completely ruining an amazing book! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s finally  in black and white, but a spaceship? A rebellion? Hunger Games-esque peace keepers? The Giver is an amazing story and book, I don&#39;t understand why they have to ruin it. 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaWay diff from the book 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI am really surprised that everyone is mentioning action, honestly, there was none. All I saw here was music to set the tone, I can promise you there almost no action that you think is there. I mean what did we see, a punch scene, a taser scene, and him being chased, that&#39;s it? Is that what classifies as action? remember people, the soundtrack sets the tone, makes you believe in what&#39;s not there, look closely again, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll understand
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThe book came before divergent. 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaLooks alot like equilibrium, maybe a little too much like equilibrium
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else remember fight scenes in the book?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaLooks a little different from the book...
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaEQUILIBRIUM? ! 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitathis is gonna be great! I was hoping it was different from the book otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be as interesting!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaIs Taylor in this trailer?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail for the trailer gave me nightmares
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else thinking of Equilibrium, ya know because they take injections to block out important things. I mean, an injection that forces you to see the world in black and white? How dull
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaDivergent meets The Island meets Oblivion
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis is &quot;Equilibrium&quot; but without the matrix style.¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI love Meryl Streep
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOMG i&#39;ve watched the first trailer a couple of months back and I remembered perfectly how there were many comments questioning that why isn&#39;t it in black and white before Jonas knew what colours were. And i&#39;m so happy to see the second trailer was 100 times so much more better than the first one.<br><br>I also saw some significant differences from the book itself, aside from Jonas being a couple of years older in the movie, I did not remember Asher being the one who&#39;s hunting Jonas down? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s purpose to make the movie more interesting and all but we&#39;ll see!<br><br>And for those who are saying that this trailer reminds you of Divergent, they are nothing alike. READ THE BOOK. It&#39;s a children&#39;s classic. Even though it&#39;s kind of a post-apocalypse/dystopian themed story, The Giver is a great book to start reading at a young age to expand our perspective on how we see life :)
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitalooks like its not going to be like the book at all
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaSo they turned The Giver into The Host/Divergent/The Hunger Games. Now, I maybe¬†wouldn&#39;t mind that if the film actually looked good, but it doesn&#39;t. It looks terrible. And it looks like all of the key elements of the novel are nonexistent in this film. Disappointing.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis is such a great book. I really wish they don&#39;t screw it up and turn it into something like Hunger Games or Divergent or any other dystopian out there. Because it isn&#39;t. I loved the idea of this world and how it was all organized and nice and peaceful. I understand that in movies, they have to change things to keep the viewers excited but I just hope they don&#39;t change so so much.¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOk this is straight from Huxley&#39;s book A Brave New World. Hope that it will be good.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitait should have been called equilibrium, the spinoff.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaSay it looks like Divergent all you want. The Giver comes first in the hierarchy of dystopian books turned into movies if I recall correctly. First as in, the book is the oldest of them all.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI dont know about this,i truly think the book didn&#39;t have this much action.I think he saved a child/baby from getting killed and i thought it was like in a colony or like a prison camp.I guess i gotta read the book again.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaNo, we are not an effective team. 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprised you guys are comparing this to not so good movies like divergent and hunger games this movie/ book adaptation is more like equilibrium than those two movies even though the giver was  created first 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only assuming the dude who wrote equilibrium read this book and decided to ripoff parts of it
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaWhaaatttt<br>That looks nothing like the book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaWOW Meryl Streep finally aged.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Pleasantville, but waaay more intense. I should read the book, watch the movie, and then as usual, complain about  how the movie wasn&#39;t as good lol 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t he get chosen to do that as a job or something
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaTHEY FUCKED IT UP. trailer ruins everything too. Really hope no one wastes their time with this and read the book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThey definitely revealed too much!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think this movie is going to be that big...<br>1. It will be released in the same week as Expandables 3<br>2. It&#39;s from TWC, which never made over 400M worldwide
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaSo, has anyone seen Equilibrium? Essentially the same concept but with the best gun martial arts ever shown on screen.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of 1984. 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaWay to give away the ENTIRE MOVIE AND THE IMPORTANT TWIST GAAH 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone get an Equilibrium vibe ?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI have a few problems by this trailer:<br>1) This book just spoiled one of the key moments. (The injection killing)<br>2) If there are no emotions, then why are those teens smiling and feeling curious about the jets.<br>3) The kids in the book were a lot younger. Jonas, the protagonist was ELEVEN years old, which is a key factor to his character! <br><br>This is an obvious cash-in from Hunger Games/Divergent success. I hate that Hollywood are basically telling young to not read the book, but to watch this movie. What&#39;s next a Catcher in The Rye movie?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOh... Okay thats better... In the last trailer everything was in color so I thought they left this major part out that the characters see everything in grey:/ but they didnt :) yey!:P
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaYesss I&#39;ve read this book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaToo much action, not enough emotional (which is internal pain). Not to mention they showed the part where his dad injects the baby, that part was the turning point
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaIan Gallagher.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOh jesus i wanna watch.. Now, when they show the entire purpose on the movie on the trailer that just takes away from the movie
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis is a lot different than the book, but that&#39;s what always happens.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThat was the WHOLE GADDAMN MOVIE
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m disappointed, this is nothing like the book. It&#39;s like this is a whole new story line!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOh my god, this trailer was way better then the 1st one and it makes me want to watch the movie!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitauh oh- that intro is nothing like the book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaDid anybody not read the book?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThe movie doesn&#39;t look too good and I never even read the book! It looks like a fan-made trailer but with Meryl Streep randomly in it... People are saying this trailer gave¬† away too much, is this true? I&#39;ve known of this book for some time, should I give it a shot? Also is it like other dystopian novels like Hunger Games and Divergent...? I hope not...
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaTheyre kind of making this film seem like an action movie too which is not really the case, Jonas doesnt fight against the community in the book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting thoughts of the Wizard of Oz with the color transitions ¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshita1984 mets Pleasantville.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI have almost lost faith in humanity
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaTHIS TRAILER REVEALS TOO MUCH!!! (like his dad killing people through injection, which is a really eye-opening realization in the book)
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Equilibrium. 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaMeryl is too good for this movie
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitanot really how I imagined the book
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like every other movie at the minute..but I love it! 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaHoly spoilers! Disappointed by that,  and holy cow is it so much more futuristic than the book! Very interested in seeing it :)
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis excites me!!!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThat doesnt really look like its following the source material.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI get why they changed the story to make it more like The Hunger Games and Divergent, but I liked the book&#39;s lack of action. There was no rebellion or fighting scenes to distract you from Lois Lowry&#39;s messages. Also, I&#39;d like to see a young adult/teen hero film that stands out from the others. Hunger Games, Divergent, the Giver, Maze Runner, and Ender&#39;s Game- see what I mean?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a little disappointed that this looks like an action movie.<br><br>The book was serene to the point of discomfort, which was what made the book so enjoyable to me
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome just awesone!!! :-)
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitathis hurts my heart, but i love the actors so who knows
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaOh sweet they finally made the movie!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaholy shit im excited for this
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI really hope this is a better dystopian film adaptation than Neil Burger&#39;s Divergent. That movie was a hollow shell of a Veronica Roth&#39;s book.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitasocialism in all its glory, hopefully this kid kills all those commie bastards
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer looks significantly closer to the book than the first trailer... ¬†although I don&#39;t know about Jeff Bridges as the Giver - I think someone like Ian McKellen would have been better, but everyone would have been associating him with Gandalf... ¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI read this book in 6th grade and loved it they said they were trying to make a movie but I didn&#39;t think they would
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis book had the quality to make an oscar worthy film.. To bad they messed up and added action to it
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Our people chose to do away with emotions. These morning injections take them away.&quot; Uh...you mean like Equilibrium? Think i&#39;ll skip this and watch that. (nah i&#39;ll watch for Bridges and Streep ngl)¬†
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaoh my gosh by the looks of it they changed big parts of the book and added things that shouldn&#39;t be there
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThey kind of ruined it with the movie. Just from looking at the movie you can see how different it is going to be from the book.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaYou know, I had my doubts, but it ended up being pretty good. Strange choice to make the entire movie less than 3 minutes, but they did manage to go through the entire plot and keep in pretty much all the relevant twists in that time so who am I to complain. And releasing it free on youtube, what an idea! Wonder if they&#39;ll make the sequel.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitathis could be a lot better if they actually followed the story in the book it could have been an oscar nominated film but they fucked it up with adding an action story arc to it.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaEquilibrium for the twilight generation
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting but somehow i kept thinking of divergent
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI read this book 6-7 months ago and I can&#39;t wait to see this movie
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaIs Meryl Streep the taker?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m reading this book in school 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI know it is normal when a book to film adaptation strays away from the book&#39;s plot, but this is an outrage! It seems like a completely different thing than the book!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThe book is amazing
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaIdk how I feel about Jonas fighting back and probably a revolution in the town just to give the teens action even the book wasn&#39;t a book with action it was a story of a kid discovering his humanity in a town with no color or emotion and in the book Jonas didn&#39;t start a revolution or fought back he just left the town with a baby and that&#39;s it.
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI really lived the book, can&#39;t wait for the movie !!! 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaEquilibrium much?
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaI love this book!!!!!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of divergent and hunger games 
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshita2nd comment! And i cant wait for this!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaIf Equilibrium and Pleasantville had a baby!
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaso hyped for this movie
uxFJvlWqphMdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s Equilibrium with kids

dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI start watching this now and this is 9 years old movie wath see in the future cause on the start before i am legend title u could see on the big building a large poster of batman vs superman xD And that movie comes this year ;)
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI loved watching this back in the old days, ma parents bought cd of it and a bunch of snacks for the afternoon when we&#39;ll watch the movie. It&#39;s just good going back.
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI hate this movie for a couple of reasons<br>1. Sam dies<br>2. John dies (It&#39;s stupid, he kills himself with the infected, counting the leader. He could have thrown the grenade and crawled through the hole, close it, and escape safely.<br>3. The ending confuses me
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI swear if the dog dies... shit&#39;s gonna get real.
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaSomeone knows like is called the soundtrack of the trailer
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaGive this dog a fuking oscar!
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitawhy does the dog have to die? i really want to watch this movie but dogs are my soft spot... what now? what shall i dooooo??????????

dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI invited a whole load of my friends over to my house for my birthday to watch this movie. 3 of them aren&#39;t coming coz they say the movie is too scary. fucks sake! my mum is getting angry at me for picking a &quot;scary&quot; movie and she says I should change it, but its my birthday I can do what I want! they can get stuffed, asnd im sick of trying to please everybody!
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshita5 star

dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitathis movie had a terrible ending
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaofc he has like his son jayden in every fucken movie
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaThe film itself was rather disappointing. I did like the panic that was displayed during the initial outbreak and the loneliness of Will Smith&#39;s character, but the film deviated from the novel in such a big way. I preferred Vincent Price&#39;s performance despite the differences it had from the novel as well.
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so sadüò¢, but it was very goodüëè
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaDid you know. The be became so attached to the dog that he asked the owner if he could buy the dog off him and the owner said no lol

dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitadaaamn! i realy want to watch this movie! daamn!
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI HATE THIS MOVIE becoz THE DOG DIED !! DAMN IT!! HAHA (LOVE THIS MOVIE) ^_^¬†
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been watching this movie as a kid when it came out and I still do.It is currently on TV.The movie brought so many emotions towards me and I couldn&#39;t stop crying when Sam died cause then I realised something.<br><br>What if this happened to us? Of course I am not saying it will and I am hoping it doesn&#39;t.The world is in a such terrible condition with all this shit happening.Muslims attack France and all that kind of stuff.Ebola,cancer...all these illnesses that kill so many people through each day..it&#39;s crazy.<br><br>All we need now is more fucking scientists and biologists mixing shit together so they could find a &quot;cure&quot; for these illnesses.I don&#39;t believe that crap.<br><br>I have a lot of fears,but one of my biggest fears from the beginning,was death.I never wanna leave this world,even if I sometimes do.<br><br>This movie has made me realise the situation in which this world is now.You never know what is going to happen.Is the world going to get in a war,are people gonna get infected even if it&#39;s 100% impossible? We don&#39;t know.And that what makes me nervous,cause I&#39;m  never gonna know when I&#39;ll leave this world or how.
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie gory
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaWaw
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitai love how he said &quot;God didn&#39;t do this to us, we did&quot; that&#39;s right, God Doesn&#39;t do this kinda of stuff to us. the world is ran by evil if any of you have forgotten that.
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaThe book was amazing! And now this? Great!
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaBest trailer ever.

dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t worry WIll Smith is alive ,he&#39;s good actor :)
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like real,but his not real :)
dtKMEAXyPkgdelimeterByIshitaam I the only one, that if I saw a lion jump out and steal my kill I would say &quot;F#$% THATS A F%$#ING LION.&quot; rather than just stand there and be like &quot;damn that lion just stole my kill.... well better luck next time.&quot;

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaWow, such a revealing trailer. No need to see the movie now!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaA lot of great actors in this one. Looks good.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> Deadpool is that you?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> Jessie from Breaking Bad!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI was expecting a zombie outbreak half way through the trailer
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this one.<br>It looks like it&#39;s going to be good.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI love that line: &quot;Be careful what you insta google tweet face.&quot;
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaDaryl!üòÑ
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> My man Jesse, Everyone keep calm B**ch
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitait would look promising, if the teaser trailer didn`t gave up the whole plot...
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaGood Trailer :D
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaWomen in the red.... Brandon roger ceo?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaFake, Mexicans can&#39;t survive this climate- Mexican Boy 19
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitavery good!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaIs good to see that Norman Reedus has better job proposals after The walking dead.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitawas this a spoof of something????
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitastep aside hail caesar, this is the real all-star cast.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaOk now I&#39;m very excited for this movie.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t know Kevin Hart did the soundtrack
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitadid i just watch the whole movie ?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see Kate!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaJohn Hillcoat usually makes good movies (The Road; The Proposition; Lawless) so I&#39;m looking forward to this. I don&#39;t think they know how to sell it though. The story itself is a lot more complex than a generic trailer. Also there is not enough Kate Winslet in here.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks more interesting now without the creepy feel like the last trailer
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaclicked for Kate Winslet. Disappointed.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaTake my money!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaDamn it, stop showing the whole movie. Everyone stop watching after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> please if you want to enjoy the film fully.<br>Oh and, DARYL??? IS THAT YOU?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaDivergent and Hunger Games crossover :O
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThat was a good movie, thanks trailer
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaWow what a great short movie.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaDamn, Huge Norman Reedus Spoiler In This If You&#39;ve Watched The First Red Band Trailer
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThe other trailer was better but in this one shows you more about the story. Whatever, I&#39;ll still watch the movie
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaTRAINING DAY 2.....Nooo nooo nOOO.???
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaafter watching Sicario, All police movie looks terrible
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaTriple D, anyone? (‚Ä¢ Œµ ‚Ä¢)
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaWHY EVEN SHOW KATE&#39;s NAME WHEN SHE&#39;S ONLY THERE FOR 2 FKING SCENES !!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitadaryl before he moved to Atlanta lol
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit that cast
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaA movie with Kate Winslet would have to be pretty terrible for me to not watch it, since she&#39;s awesome
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=2m06s">2:06</a> wonder woman
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitathat looks nice but you fucked it up with the long trailer that actually described all the movie !
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaomg finally an original cop movie
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitawhere s Kate Winslet?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaOnly watching for Gal Gadot (and Anthony Mackie)
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaBasically a heist version of Training Day but I&#39;m still interested in the movie and DAMN did ya&#39;ll see Wonder Woman üò®üòç
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaCasey Affleck&#39;s face is enough for me NOT to see this movie.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a decent movie except for the sexual content :/.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzUtr5sjRvU&amp;t=2m06s">2:06</a> Wonder Woman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitalooks like a mixture of &quot;set it off&quot; and &quot;training day&quot;...could be good
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaIf you compare this trailer and the red band trailer you can see that darryl Dixon has the yellow bag on his head that the cop shoots when he is in the car ( this is a theory )
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaOh look, it&#39;s the first of the February slush pile of movies with all the A-listers in supporting roles for the paycheck.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaLot&#39;s of Rap/Hip Hop in the soundtrack.... Yeah, it will be crap.
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT FOR THIS MOVIE!! :D
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaDaryl and Jesse
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaIt can be bullshit, bu still: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Remember the head in yellow bag from the red band trailer? Seems like second trailer spoil us something. Something that this guy is Norman Reedus character!

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or did I not see any of the actors that are in the title of the video?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaonly here to see gal gadot                                                   worth it

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitadoes Casey Affleck ever stop chewing gum?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThe mix between The Departed, The Town, Inside Man
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaSo....like Training Day?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I wanna watch this movie is because Norman Reedus is in it
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitacan movies sound FX stop making cock sounds with striker fired pistols... PLEASE
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t tell if I think this movie will be good or not
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaNow Kate is Russian?

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaThis might be my favorite movie of 2016

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t take Casey Affleck and Woody seriously in this for some reason

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaferry cool
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaWas the spoiler that he was the traitor really necessary ?
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitalooks promising and certainly entertaining, but they spoiled the bloody movie yet again...

JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaGood work giving away mackie as the traitor 
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaNever been a big wins let fan 
JzUtr5sjRvUdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitanice vibe to the movie.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitacool movie just saw everything in 2mins
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitao.o what... that... eh?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaMaybe. Yeah... I&#39;ll watch it.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI think I wanna see.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks kind of amazing.

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson is probably the most prominent genius of our generation. I&#39;m saying this as a statement of fact. not just my opinion. 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaBruce Willis- As Alton Brown

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaYay!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@BDF5K thank you so much, you helped a great day. 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitathks reddit you always know whats best
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great... but does anyone else feel like it&#39;s going to be one of those movies where all the good parts are in the trailer?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@viniciusb what about fantastic mr fox?  it was pretty good
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis must be the best Anderson film yet because it&#39;s not out yet and I&#39;m already confused. 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaTAKE MY UPBOAT
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t my computer accepting my money?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThe main character goes to my school and is in my grade.  
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI would go see it if it was free.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@InuvikPhil Not enough unfortunate paternity.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song that starts at 0:16? And the song at 0:45 for that matter. :D
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaSo is your mom.  Have a nice day.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking horrible.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitahipster trash
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita&quot;Soon&quot; How soon!? 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaKITTIE!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaNot sure what to think of this one....to be honest it doesn&#39;t look very strong in the story department, but then again I guess it could be good.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaoh god yes!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaAnother classic from Wes Anderson. Bill Murray RULES!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWow. New Wes with Bill. Can&#39;t wait!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@diablossmirk blasphemy. bill murray is bigger than jesus. norton kicks a lot of ass too though
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThey should somehow get wes anderson involved in the Ghostbusters movie, cuz i really want to see it get made

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a hipsters wet dream
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI liked it better the first time when it was called: &quot;The Life Darjeeling with Rushmore Tennenbaum.&quot;
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaumm WHAT? i have noclue who wes anderson is but...ok...
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI FUCKING LOVE
EDWARD NORTON
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@JMcWin You honestly think that he hasn&#39;t already...
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaHIPSTERS.... ASSSEMMMBLLLLLLE!!!!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaHipsters.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaHOOORAH!!!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@InuvikPhil haha was thinking the same thing. pulling out all his aces in this one it seems. 

side note: have never really noticed how flat the majority of his shots are. 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitacat popping his head out of basket at the end was what did it for me!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitathis.

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaso much EPIC
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaSo. Is Bruce Willis&#39; hair real?

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M THROWING MONEY AT THE SCREEN BUT NOTHING&#39;S HAPPENING!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaBill fucking Murray and Ed Norton. def will watch
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@hameed wtf are you on about, explain.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@Meeruman this trailer gave me diabetes D=
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@hameed

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitayesss!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@huddo121 Hopefully into the face of the next person who quotes an overplayed meme
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaAs an Eagle Scout. I approve of this movie.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@huddo121 YAH right into someone&#39;s elbow
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaNeeds less explosions if its going to be accepted by pop culture
 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaHope it&#39;s good..
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWe all know where that arrow was going, right?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaDid they just put all of the other Wes Anderson movies in a blender and pour this out?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWTF haahahahahhaaa
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI love Wes Anderson, but i dont know if i¬¥ll love this Movie more than Royal Tenenbaums or Mr. Fox
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson should seriously check out some French New Wave cinema, I think he&#39;d like it.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI NEED TO WATCH THIS!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWes anderson should be an adjective.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitabad
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaso hip
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaA good movie? These are so rare these days.

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWhat did I just watch?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis casting is awesome.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI mixed up Wes Anderson and Wes Craven and was very confused about this preview...
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaGIDEON!
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaPlease tell me that this is a real movie
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell did i just watch

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWOOT

7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaI actually really want to see this...
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita@kendrat199 According to the Shazam iOS app, it&#39;s &quot;Le Temps de l&#39;Amour&quot; by Fran√ßoise Hardy.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaCan someone tell me the name of the song or artist in the video. The one with the french lyrics
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshita....WTF???
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know which song plays from 0:17 to 0:25 approx?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be amazing
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song that starts playing at 0:49?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWes Anderson, effing with our minds, one awesome movie at a time.
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaDAT CAST
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitathis looks......crazy o.O 
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaWTF did i just watch?
7N8wkVA4_8sdelimeterByIshitaweird, but watchable

SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaJasmine Marie Lewis
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is one of the only things that make me completely and genuinely happy so much so I&#39;m usually teary eyed at the end
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshita1988 film was much better!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaJohn Travolta tho üòÇüòÇ
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaOmg, it&#39;s 2017 and I still loved these movie!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaBRITTANY SNOW OMG BAE
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer didn‚Äôt capture what hairspray really is hairspray is my Fav MOVIE üçø
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitalove this
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaThat moment when a man looks a thousand times better than you  as a woman - and you&#39;re a woman.
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaIn the original hairspray film the clothes didn&#39;t even look like they were from the 60s. I much prefer this one
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitathis is honestly the best version of hairspray. it&#39;s better than the original in 1988 and better than the hairspray live version on nbc.
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaTHIS WAS MY MOVIE GROWING UP...I LUV THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaIs the audio and video all glitchy for anyone else? Or is that just me...?
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaI was in a production of Hairspray a few weeks ago and performing this classic was amazing. In You Can&#39;t Stop The Beat the crowd were screaming and singing (really badly, no offence) and it was just amazing
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaWhy does zac look like robbie from sportacus?
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaThere was no need for this sanitized version.
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaIve seen the movie thousands of times but I&#39;ve never seen the trailer
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaMY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaLoved the Movie Hairspary

SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaGood Times
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaThis, i&#39;m sure, will be WAY better than  the Live remake they&#39;re doing for NBC. SMH!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaour school Is doing this play! can&#39;t wait to audition!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitathis movie  is way better than the original movie
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaBrittany Snowüòçüòç
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitathis movie is secretly a fricken Masterpiece- it isn&#39;t just a musical with EXTREMELY catchy songs, it surprisingly delves deep into racism and equality for black people too. Seriously: for a musical to be both entertaining AND heartfelt towards race, this movie deserves an Oscar : /!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaI just melted at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUoG7mqCixI&amp;t=1m54s">1:54</a>
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaAmanda‚ù§
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshita2007 was a hell of a year for cinema and this was a gem on the crown of gems.  I know I am not popular when I say this was my favorite movie over &quot;There will be Blood&quot; and &quot;No Country for Old Men.&quot;   Those two movies are classic and will have a longer shelf life than this movie but this movie was not only fun but a labor of love.  Everyone gives a 100%...I felt the enthusiasm through the screen and all the dancing was incredible.
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaMemories...
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care it&#39;s my opinion about the movie
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitai love this movie why did they put a picture of the hairspray head in the film enchanted
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitathis is an amazing movie!
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaTo be honest, I hate that fat girl.<br>Only Watched the movie cuz of Brittany Snow.<br>Britt is so Kawaii
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaIs it me?or these songs sound like high school musical songs?
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaI love the original with Divine, I love the original show with Fierstein etc., and I love this with Travolta. All differ, all are good.
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaOmg i love this movie
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshitaI like the dance moms hairspray trailer parody better<br>
SUoG7mqCixIdelimeterByIshita1:53 kills me!! ZAC &lt;3

679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitawhen am I gonna watch movie??? November is too far.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of a 1997 Hong Kong movie &quot;Intimates.&quot;
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaRooney Mara resembles Audrey Hepburn in this film. She&#39;s adorable.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitalooking forward to it, hope it&#39;s not another lesbian tragedy lol
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaAnd, as always, the bad lesbian couple hurt the straight folk. Why are we always the ones cheating in movies??
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaheartwarming bgm
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaÊÑõÊòØ‰∏ÄÂàá
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitabest  actress nomination awards season 2016 for the brilliant Cate
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaLooks just like the usual Lesbian movie format.. 2 women fall in love, one of them is married and in the end goes back to her husband?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the name of the piano piece?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCate totally blew me away in Blue Jasmine. I still can&#39;t get over how awesome that movie was, and how great her performance was in there.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCOME OUT AND DRAG ME BY MY EDGES
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaseriously....wats with all the gay movies...n its always the same story line
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitajust cant wait for dec....cate blanchett and rooney mara work soooooo perfect
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I watch this movie online without downloading? thanks
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCate, Cate, Cate Why are you so straight?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitajust finished reading the book, and I&#39;m so excited to see how they cover certain sections of the novel. And, not forgetting Sarah Paulson. I&#39;ve always loved her in period clothing, ahem, Lana Winters.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaScissor me timbers!
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitai like her .....she is so perfect........
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI love Cate Blanchett so much! It&#39;s about time she has stepped into a role such as this.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaL E S B I A N S : THE MOVIE
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCate Blanchett is Meryl Streep no. 2. Amazing Actress.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s just something so heartbreaking in that one moment with Rooney Mara at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=679wr31SXWk&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a>
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCate Blanchett was literally the perfect casting choice. She&#39;s basically the exact physical manifestation of Carol in the book (The Price of Salt). Mara should hit it out of the park as well.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaTrying to find the best words to describe this trailer, and the magnificent Cate Blanchett. But I can&#39;t.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaAll these movies about gay people now that&#39;s not what God intended O_O=_=
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait anymore... omfg ;-;
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitainteresting to see a trailer for a not frivolous movie about adult non-heterosexual women
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThe female narrator and music - Did anyone get reminded of the movie with multiple lives from past and future with actors catwoman, Tom hanks, Notting hills actor...
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitawow 160 jerks
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshita+1
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaWonderful
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s something about Cate Blanchett that perplexes me. I only remember seeing a film with her in it with Hanna, and then watching her present this year&#39;s best actor at the Oscar&#39;s to Eddie Redmayne, I find it difficult to wrap my head around the fact they are the same person. She&#39;s an age chameleon
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitathere are no accidents, and everything comes full circle... love this
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks a masterpiece.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the piano music please :D ?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaOmfg
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaHasn&#39;t come out and people are already claiming it to win all oscars. I swear of this gets more oscars then black mass...
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaSong?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so gonna cry my heart out watching this film.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so ready for this.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t want to crap heavily on anyone&#39;s parade (I&#39;m on a float holding a big &quot;I LOVE CAROL MOVIE&quot; banner in said parade)... but I don&#39;t see Oscars. I just don&#39;t. Because Hollywood is retarded when it comes to films like this. It should absolutely win, but it most probably won&#39;t. I think the most it&#39;ll get is a possible nom for cinematography, and costume design.

679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks AWESOME!
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit! That looks boring as hell. Blanchett is a mutt by the way. :)
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaIm in love with this trailer. Rooney and Cate are amazing actresses. I love the book to. And in the book they are both the main chaarcters of the story. And in this trailer they both seem like leads as well
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaSARAH PAULSON !!!
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI hope the poor husband gets everything in the divorce
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI bet this movie will be nominated for an oscar

679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaEasy Tutorial: How to make a boring movie
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitai hope that hot shit 18+.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitawow. this is perfection. the story, the music, the acting, the cinematography. i can&#39;t even.... i just want to see this movie now!
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m kinda interesting in what direction the movie is going. It sourds like it will be a whole different point of view than the book. I&#39;m definitely excited for it but also anxious. I mean the book is amazing, my favorite, so i&#39;m afraid to be disappointed..
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaBest actress: Cate Blanchett <br>Best supporting actress: Rooney Mara
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaoh my god,¬† i love it! Cate and Rooney are just amazing. I can&#39;t wait to see the movie
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaWTF???
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitai am filled with anticipation and excited i think i might explode.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaCate Blanchett is really strong talented actress ..
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaoh, christ.. oscar season is here; OSCAR SEASON IS HERE!!
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaPerfect time for this film to come out lol.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshita100% sure i will masturbate to this.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaIf they ever have an Audrey Hepburn biopic, Rooney could definitely portray her.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaoh my god! with this trailer, i knw that this will stay in my heart forever.. what a masterpiece
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThe music reminds of interstellar.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaso this movie is about a wife cheating on her husband with another woman in the 1950&#39;s ? BBOORRINGG!! Cate Blanchett is to good of an actress to waste her time on this. She should take on more difficult and interesting roles.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaReally now??? Hollywood is out of ideas .
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaLIL JUJU - WHATS YOUR NAME . Search that song!!!

679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible, and definitely an Oscar contender. I&#39;m hoping for a third award for Cate Blanchett, and the first for Rooney Mara that she should have got for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=679wr31SXWk&amp;t=0m19s">0:19</a> damn i thought is audrey hepburn alive~
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaIdk what&#39;s the problem with this movie? It has good cinematography, nice music, romance, and Sarah Paulson. So what is y&#39;all issue???
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitacare blanchett looks sexy no matter what she does
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitarooney mara and cate blanchett having lesbian sex? who doesnt wanna see that
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaisnt that blonde hair girl is the cinderella&#39;s step mother?
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaWoah...I&#39;ve never seen Cate Blanchett in a role like this! Will forever see her as an elf
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaAhhhh the cliches <b>sigh</b>
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitathis is how you make a trailer
679wr31SXWkdelimeterByIshitaAnother boring shitty movie made by Todd Haynes.

jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favorite movie
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaUmmm I watched this for the first time last night. Sooo damn good!
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaSeen in:<br>Safe <br>Prometheus <br>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter <br>Ted
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitasimps the movie
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaWhat if the lost Galaxy power rangers did a crossover with the savages movie and they help defeat the territories and save Blake lively aka o
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so good.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaSavages (2012) Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Taylor Johnson, Blake Lively, Benicio del Toro, John Travolta and Salma Hayek.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even smoke and you telling me  the church type
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaA very bad movie.   Pffffffffff
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaHuh, they made an Army of Two movie.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaYOU STABBED A FEDERAL AGENT!
(kills him)
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaJames Brown - Payback
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaJees Salma Hayek and Del Toro must need the money. Another boring and forgettable crap heap. 

jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaWHAT IS THE LAST SONG IN THE TRAILER!?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m with ivanasn what&#39;s the name of the song
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s like one trailer with a black man singing , sorry to be racese but I just wanna know what that songs called...?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitathe one on my spotify ad is &quot;till i colapse&quot; by eminem
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone think this looks kinda like Army of Two (Video Game)?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThank u it is some1 understands
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaNon of the above. Its a live movie of army of two game. Ripped off
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis shit looks really wack, not seeing. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaWOT DOES HE SAYYYYY @ 1:28 ? LOL
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaYeah your right someone was playing army of two and added a drug story to it haha
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaKind of looks like the two guys from Army of Two

jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitano ya dont

jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaarmy of two the movie...this has something to do with roided up mercenaries? Military deception? Ohhhh right...they wear masks...this trend of lazy comparisons is growing tiresome. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaYes, by Don Winslow, and by the looks of this trailer it&#39;s gona stay true to it. They use about three direct quotes from the book just in this trailer.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a book?

jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaHas anyone here, other than me, read the book?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaone question, is the pussy that good?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not another stupid ass stoner flick. Bout time we had an actual drug movie.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s making Mexican drug cartels and desperate men look violent. Which is often true.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitawas skeptical until I saw my buddy Benicio
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitalove the vibe of the film, but why did they have to ruin so much of the story with this pointlessly long trailer?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitalame
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaHonestly this looks like a pretty cool movie, i just dont like that it becomes centered on a chick :/ idk..might passsss.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshita1:53 Hammertime!
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitabadass
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitadrugs sex violence dats all we need
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaBullets!
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaEhhh.........pass
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshita1:55 - Hammer Time
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaBlake Lively&#39;s narration voice in the beginning is soo annoying !!
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaArmy of Two...
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking insane. Cannot wait.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty intense. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaIt reminds me of Super Mario Bros. only with more violence and weed.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThe opening line is a copy from Kick Ass. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitathis is fucking refreshing... 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll see it......but only because of Taylor Kitsch 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaLooks alright i just hope blake lively gets her gash out
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaKick-Ass and John Carter? them poor Mexicans...
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaDid they just seriously Stab John Travolta??!?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking terrible...
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaa blonde chick, who cheated on her boyfriend with another guy, and is now telling you the story dead, on a beach.... Doctor Who anyone?
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaman, kick-ass looked so dorky in kick ass, but here he looks.... kick ass
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaMore like 50 cent Blood on the Sand
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitathis looks so stupid
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshita Aaron Johnson why you so good looking
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitawheres Emile Hirsch? 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitasalma hayek...mmm mmm
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaI liked it until it became a movie about saving Blake Lively. 
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitahahahaha i thought i was the only one that had that thought lol
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitagood movie even though im half Mexican, the other half im Native American, it&#39;s true what they do with drug cartels in Mexico, they will kill anyone, and i mean anyone, so that&#39;s why i don&#39;t go to Mexico anymore, but it&#39;s true they are making their way over in U.S.A
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaExactly what I was thinking.
jDZSt_MhU4QdelimeterByIshitaor a lsd trip...

LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaPHILLY, represent!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaDamn. Looks like an awesome ass flick . . definitely gonna check it out for this when it comes out.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI wish this screened in my town. Twitter giveaways etc always seem to go to the big apple. Great actors, story, action, director. I supported all F. Gary Gray&#39;s other films, now I&#39;m unemployed. Oh well, who cares, right?
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaWOW this looks great!!! and two of my Fav actors!!the ladies will have eye candy and the guys will have action LOL
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaoh yeah he&#39;s badass for making a deal with a criminal when GB is screwed over by him
But you have to admit being a spy is badass
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitahmmm.... I&#39;ll bet that turns out to be a shit movie. but I&#39;ll also bet it makes a lot of cash!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathats what we should do to every god damn corrupted cop/politician who sell their job to the highest bidder.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitatwo wrongs don&#39;t make a right... and Jamie Foxx sucks.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaMan when,tell me when will they make the Tom Clancy book Without Remorse into a film?
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitai know right..
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathis is the best trailer so far!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI agree. Transformers disappointed me the most. It was too long and had crap that wasn&#39;t needed in the film.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaYeah I agree with you. You know know it will be an awesome movie with Gerald Butler. I can finally see him on the bad side. See what he is capable of.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaROFL!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaFucking sick.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshita....sick...it will be awesome if he spart kicks jaime fox into a dark pit at the end....

LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawhat if it&#39;s hot?
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitajamie fox is a bitch in this movie
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaLooks good.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaTHIS IS JUSSSTICE!!!!!!!

 f**k dis movie is gonna b kick asss!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitai love these kind of revenge flicks. the criminal justice system so often have their hands tied, so maybe just maybe a little vigilante justice isnt such a bad thing
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s what Jamie Foxx gets for messing with Gerard Butler.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaOf course I don&#39;t, I haven&#39;t even watched the movie. How would I know who to root for, if anyone, judging by a short trailer?

And what I&#39;m actually saying is that we shouldn&#39;t need to be told who to root for, not that I didn&#39;t know.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawow!!!
any1 kno when itz gonna be out??
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaYeah what this guy said. This shit&#39;s gonna be good!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaDo you really need a clear cut &quot;root for me&quot; character in every story?

It&#39;s a sad state of play when people are ASKING to be spoon fed this stuff, instead of making their own decisions.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaGerard Butler can probably beat the shit out of Chuck Norris....

i feel it in my gut hahhaha
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI agree !
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI hope his American accent NEVER, EVER influences or changes his Scottish accent.  I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE his Scotish accent!!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaThe guy killing everyone
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaim rooting for gerard butler, just cuz THIS IS SPARTA! lol because he&#39;s so epic in 300, i think he&#39;ll make up for that garbage romantic comedy he made
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitalooks good
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaidiot
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawhen is it coming out : D?
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshita300
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitai remember wen they were shooting this...one of my teachers was like...im gonna go down to c Gerard Butler today!...lol like stalk him
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaLooks great. I stopped watching at about a minute in because way too much was given away though.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaomg! i got chills up my spine.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitalooks pretty fuckin bad ass
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitadate of release? o_o
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaPure Awesomeness
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitalooks pretty good
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathis trailer looked awesome in the theater when I saw H2
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaGAMER sucked double ass
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI like the idea of this film a lot but it could get too far fetched.
Hopefully it wont though.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaOh Gerard! -swoon- -touchtouch-

Okay. Enough of that. This movie looks so brutal.
I absolutely can&#39;t wait to see it. This is the first time I really find myself siding with the killer. He has nothing else to lose, so why not fix the system himself? Pick off the ones that failed his family until something changes. Brilliant. 

And he looks so good doing it. I honestly hope Jamie Foxx fails. Isn&#39;t that terrible? D:
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny how that dude from 300 looks tiny in other movies. But he is a good actor and this does look like its going to be a good movie. This is SPARTIA!!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawow ive never seen anyone get as cynical as Anthony Hopkins in any of the movies ive watched....this is going to be some grade a shit...
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitatoo hard
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitanevermind my question..
lol
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawhen is this movie coming out?
does anyone know the speciifc date?
its a must-see!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitai would love nothing better than to see a racist like jamie Foxx get his ass haned to him.....
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaI would love to see that racist Foxx killed in a movie.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaJust tell us when and we&#39;ll make it a deadline to see this one...
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaawesome............cant wait
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaHim playing in 300, was on of the best fitting roles I&#39;ve ever seen. Hes a sweet actor.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaYeah, finally. I love this kind of revenge movies and a revenge movie with my all-time-favorite actor MrGerard Butler ...a dream come true ;) The trailer is awesome. I ca&#39;t wait...
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshita...Which you haven&#39;t seen yet.

And neither have I. I&#39;m just saying I get that vibe from this trailer.

Gerard Butler is starting to become a bit of a Jason Statham. Too many &quot;badass&quot; roles in movies with huge explosions and unbelievably epic situations.

The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, and Memento were psychological thrillers. This looks like it will rely on car explosions and trite remarks like &quot;I&#39;m just getting started&quot;
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathat looks tiiight
butler is badd on this movie
hell yeah!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaThis looks like it will be one of those films that is made to look different, but will ultimately end up being like GI Joe or Transformers.

If you don&#39;t get what I mean, you&#39;re probably someone who will like it.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this movie my kind of movies!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshita&quot;WOW&quot; wat a show...........can&#39;t wait 4 this film 2 b release. Anyone noe when d show being released?
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m just getting warmed up&quot;
Seriously, there is more???? I am already left breathless. This is what I call a real film. WELL Done to Gerry and the team both cast and crew.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaintense!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitawowowwo , want to watch it !!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaFUCK YEEEEAAAAHHHHH
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathis is looks nuts
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be FN awsome!! I hope Gerry gets an award for this role!!!!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitathis looks awesome
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaGerard Butler kills everything in his movies....and its glorious!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaHow is this a romance movie? LOL i think you need to watch more then the first 10sec of the trailer.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaGerard Butler need to leave the romance alone!!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitacant w8t
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitait&#39;s great

LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitagreat :)
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaSICK
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s so nice? :o
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaNice
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaAlthough he&#39;s still killing people in this movie, it&#39;s nice to see butler as something different than the buff ass soldier/warrior.
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaoh shit!!! i just jumped outta my seat in excitement!! this movies looks phenomenal! i love movies where the good guys go on killing sprees! i.e. the punisher and taken lol
LX6kVRsdXW4delimeterByIshitaSeeing this right away.

A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaThese movies are usually crap but this has such a great cast, and I&#39;m sure they must all have had such a fun time filming this, that its gonna be seen in their performance, and this movie will be hilarious ! At least I hope so :p
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaPoor choice of song but I might see it just for the sake of it being 12 movies in one.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI usually don&#39;t enjoy these kinds of movies but this looks hilarious.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching this movie because I&#39;m black and they&#39;re white!
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaSoooooooooooooo...............because of the stars then.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaIdiots are only watchin&#39; it because of the stars..... I&#39;m watchin&#39; it because Gerald Butler is the leprechaun........ And Halle Berry&#39;s still hot.

I&#39;m totally fuckin&#39; in and voting &quot;yeah&quot; with all my five snagged body parts...
Sorry... six body parts. I forgot the head.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI actually think this is my dream come true.. Hugh Jackman Emma Stone and Ana Faris all in the same movie! It&#39;s like there were no good directors that have thought of this before! All they need is Ricky Gervais, Will Feral, and Milla Kunis.. I&#39;m too busy dieting of excitement now.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaFor me it started being awesome when Emma Stone showed up.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaNananananana - My Chemical Romance
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitawow, so many stars!.

A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshita1:41 Chloe Moretz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitayour black !!!!!
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI thought my mom was hiding something from me.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s it. I can&#39;t wait for this movie.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaThe Red Band Trailer Rocks Better
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie might be good except PSY is gonna have a guest role so ive heard -_-
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaNo, they just made it look like it to entertain you with fake movie trailers. They also got high paid actors too.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI knew my mom was hiding something from me.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaAlright, this is scaring me.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not your brother.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitamy chemical roamnce on the soudtrack, the only good thing in it... :x

A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaWhoop di doo.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaOMG Gerard Butler as a MIDGET! O_O

Wanna see it now.....
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaHate the explicit version
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitathe amount of shamelessness in this movie is so...right!  
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaHell Yeah, if Johnny Knoxville is there, the movie is BAD ASS (Y)
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshita00:37 wheatley
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitanot as funny as the red band

A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaSo many oscar-tier actors with so many comedy-tiers actors in the same movie. If so many of them think this is a good idea, i probably should too ^^
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitawhen i first started this trailer i was like, &quot;great, another shitty spoof comedy&quot; but by the time i was done i was like &quot;Hell fuckin Yeah, this movie is going to be awesome!&quot;
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitathis won&#39;t be funny
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a wayans bros. movie?......should be pretty funny then
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaCompletely pathetic, Top of the Razzies
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaHopefully this movie doesn&#39;t fall face first, every time they&#39;ve tried to make a comedy movie with a ridiculous cast it doesn&#39;t work.
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaElizabeth Banks is the producer of this movie can u believe it ?
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaSeems really awesome!!
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaCHLOE MORETZ!! I WILL SEE THIS MOVIE ONLY FOR CHLOE &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaNice job! :D
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaoh man how many actors are there ^^ 
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshita&quot;You&#39;re black their white!&quot;
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so stupid that I have to watch it
A9fBCkwDW8cdelimeterByIshitalooks very funny lol
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawow trash recognize trash¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWhere are the black people? 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI hate to admit it, but it looks like it SHOULD at least be entertaining.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill Smith&#39;s apology for after earth 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m intrigued. I&#39;ll watch it
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaFRANK OCEAN!!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaAt first it seemed okay, then I realized I know exactly where it&#39;s going and how it will end. No thanks/10
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshita<b>*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*</b><br>This is why I hate most trailers now a days. What I can see from the trailer ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=2m01s">2:01</a> ) ¬†is that the love interest was pulling a con the whole time on Will Smith&#39;s character. I really do hate when trailers ruin ¬†twists or surprises.¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitathat frank ocean &lt;3
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI been waiting so long for your movie and this is what you come out with, i mean You are Will FCKN SMITH for crying out loud !!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitai was wondering when the next will smith movie come out and now my question has been answered¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so boring. It&#39;s like Ocean&#39;s Eleven without George Clooney and the other 10 guys.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitamovies like this usually have a white lead actor like Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Cruise, or Brad Pitt or somebody which is why it&#39;s kinda weird to see a black lead actor in it. kinda weird which is why it&#39;s kinda cool. Only a top paid actor like Will Smith could get a role like this.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWhy hasn&#39;t Will Smith won an oscar yet? That&#39;s the question.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a FAIL...
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaFINALLY WILL.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaHas WS ever played a villain?
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWhat is the deal of the voice of Margot Robbie, damn!!! it just melt me
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitacant wait!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawill&#39;s back baby!!!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaFinally the homie Will is coming with something that looks interesting I mean I want to see him get back at it again
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a> I&#39;m in love &lt;3
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaDoes this remind anyone else of Hustle, the tv series.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the black people?
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitathey work together connin everybody, they fall in love, but then will smith finds out that she&#39;s been conning him the whole time, so then, without her knowing, he finds a way to con her back. this will be the storyline.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaMake a mofo men in black 4
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaThat Margot Robbie chick is probably the most beautiful actress I have ever seen on screen. She is something else! She was so hot in Wolf of Wall Street too.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLet me guess, he gets double crossed by the girl? 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaThis doesn&#39;t seem like a will Smith type of movie... :/
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaFrankie on the soundtrack makes life ok lol
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaAnything with Will Smith in it...it&#39;s a must see. ¬†( NOTE: &quot;After Earth&quot; is not included)
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill Smith is Back !.. after that sad excuse of a movie with his no talent son. This looks So Good !
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawill this be the Will Smiths come back from those terrible movies with his son?
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaDamn they got my son Hitch running cons with white women now.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaSo, the expert con-artist hires a sexy intern to teach her how take scores and... uh, we need an ending to this movie. Quick, have him throw away his rulebook and stop thinking algorithmically because, you know, she&#39;s wearing that red dress all hot women wear. Excellent twist.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBad Boys 3 confirmed
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know about this one, Will Smith&#39;s movie is either good or bad! You make the comments.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawillyyyy
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaMargot Robbie really reminds me of Jamie Presley.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI want Sci-fi action Will Smith (without his children) Heavy drama story Will Smith not &#39;21&#39; &#39;YourConMovieHere_____&quot; Will Smith. :( looks like a TV movie script with a budget.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLooks GOOD!¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaok will cut the shit man, WE WANNA SEE BAD BOYS 3!!!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill Smith may come back from the dead from this one
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI am a bit over Will Smith but hopefully this will make up for the <b>cough*After Earthshit</b>
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaIm the biggest will smith fan but‚Ä¶ why this movie. it doesn&#39;t look that interesting at all smh, I feel like i&#39;ve watched this movie a dozen times before, I&#39;ll probably wait until it comes out on netflix¬†<br>c&#39;mon Will get back on your A game bro!! I hope I&#39;m totally wrong about this movie and it turns out to be good
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawe need a hancock 2!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLove WS.¬† But, i&#39;m not terrably impressed with this trailer.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill looks like he infuse a lot of life into this film and I already predict a twist that involves Margot Robbie&#39;s character trying to betray him lol
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI was wondering what Will Smith has been up too! Movie wise!¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaTypical! Show me a GOOD movie trailer for once...and then kick me in the ass, tug on my balls and tell me to go watch it in 2015 with no date....just a year....Ya bastards! :)
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill needs stop paying with our emotions and get Bad Boys 3 rolling.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> look at Will and Margot tied in the chair with that old man standing behind Rodrigo Santoro (probably the villain), which lead us to believe that they are together. probably the ending of the movie, big ass spoiler¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaNo way! He went from being naked on live television to being in a move with aliens. William Smith was my hero until he broke my sisters heart in the movie hitch. Every since than I haven&#39;t been able to forgive him. He used to help me with my music. He changed on everybody now.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI can wait for this to come on Netflix, no hurry. 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaMan when is saw the picture before playing I thought it was Bad Boys 3!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawill watch it for this hot blonde girl and her sex scenes
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaok white people have officially taken will smith lol¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBlah
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBuenos Aires papa¬°¬°
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitafrankkkk
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaSo is Will Smith ever going to prove he is a good actor or were Ali and the Pursuit of Happyness just flukes?
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaSo basically it&#39;s Hitch but conning
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitammmmm es drama.... estoy acostumbrada en velo en accion, bueno en busca de la felicidad estuvo hermosa, ojala y esta igual ;)
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBuenos Aires ‚ô•¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty lame. Also, it&#39;s always a Black dude with a Blond girl. It would&#39;ve been great if it was a hot Black woman paired opposite Will. It&#39;s like an agenda, because it&#39;s the same coupling everywhere in media nowadays.<br>Someone like Aisha Tyler would be great.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI love Will Smith I grew up on him definitely watching this
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaHoly shit. Will Smith is sexy!!!!! Go ahead baby.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBuenos Aires!¬†
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWho is this &#39;Margot Robbie?! And who is this &#39;Margot Robbie&#39;?!?!?!!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitabad boys 3 PLEASE
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWHERE ARE ALL TYE BLACK PEOPLE !!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaOMG finally YASSS, Will Smith hasn&#39;t done a movie in like forever ( I&#39;m not counting After Earth ) !!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaCool, but where&#39;s HANCOCK 2? :&#39;(
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting, I hope it isn&#39;t as predictable as the trailer leads it to be. Btw, come on Will Smith... I&#39;ve been waiting for Bad Boys 3!!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaThe punch at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a> looks so real.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaIs that Tusk? Lol
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaEmiliana Torrini - Gun - the second song with that starts @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=0m28s">0:28</a>
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaPay Attention Men cause the Lesson is the same over and over:<br><b>&quot;NEVER trust a woman 100%&quot;</b><br><br>The most trust you should ever give is 75%.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill Smith doesn&#39;t age. 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitafail
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sold on it yet...
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitayeah¬†I doesn&#39;t seem like the revitalizing role his career needs right now<br>¬†I know its just one trailer but damn I felt no build up of interest from it
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaAfter that crappy &quot;After Earth&quot; movie, it&#39;s good to see Will Smith in a movie that I actually want to see again.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaGuys watch my live reaction to this trailer if you like funny stuff.
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaAfter Earth: Never Forget
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaUnusual role for him....
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaWill is a Boss
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaAs long as Jaden is NOT in this, it looks great!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI hate to say this but I have to. Will Smith looks old
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaOuch. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCRgtdAuBo&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> was just terrible. Damn, Will Smith. The older you&#39;re getting the more you&#39;re losing your reputation on great acting. 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBuenos Aires!, ojal√° no haya salido mochilin como extra (?
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaKristen Stewart couldn&#39;t have pulled this role off, she would have looked like a little kid playing dress up. 
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshita¬†looks pretty meh
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitawill smith, ok
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBadd religionnnn,  franky ‚ô•
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaDwayne Johnson: FOCUS!!
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaque linda Buenos Aires
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaBut why is it called &quot;Focus?&quot;
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitaI wanted to see more from Buenos Aires :(
MxCRgtdAuBodelimeterByIshitai love it
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaSame soundtrack as &quot;Loveless&quot; 2017
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaNo thanks. I‚Äôm not watching a movie that teaches it‚Äôs okay to kill babies.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaShe killed her child just to make a career, and she is respected by the left, this is so absurd.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitawhy did this movie have to be made? Great acting from all the actors and actresses BUT there wasnt a story and NO ending
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://youtu.be/4Hb3DFELq4Y">https://youtu.be/4Hb3DFELq4Y</a>
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaThis is such a great movie. Unfortunately, the make-up and hair are very current and not period. No one saw this during the making?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaI am very disappointed this is not a remake of the classic and hilarious movie The Happening
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaGood film üòÆ
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/yaWTtbq1Kw4?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/yaWTtbq1Kw4?feature=share</a>
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaSo murder is better than being unhappy?  Gotcha üëå
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaYou have to have something SERIOUSLY wrong with you mentally to kill your own child the way she did. Nothing like an obsession with yourself, at the cost of everyone around you.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaAborto legal seguro y gratuito en todos los pa√≠ses üíö Fuerte pel√≠cula.  Recomendada.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitawhats this song?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaso, don&#39;t be a &quot;shlore,&quot; got it.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitabest film I&#39;ve seen since The Worst Person in the World or Lost Illusions or Drive my Car.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so rediculous that the film industry has this in their back pocket. Roe v Wade was overturned, get used to it mfers.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaA dublagem desse filme √© horrivel. Quem for assistir recomendo baixar a vers√£o no idioma original.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaAnd ‚Äú Man‚Äù
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaWell well well. If it isn&#39;t the consequences of one&#39;s actions.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaKill your baby if you want, that&#39;s your choice. But don&#39;t expect a round of applause.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaConsequence of abortion being illegal.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe people call this movie proabortion, when its totally the contrary. Abortion would be always a crime. Stupid feminists u r so hipocrates. U cannot even save the life of another woman inside u.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaThis is a movie that each Supreme Court justice should watch.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaÿ™ÿßŸÅŸá Ÿàÿßÿ∫ŸÑÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿπŸÑŸäŸÇÿßÿ™ ŸÉÿ∞ÿßÿ®Ÿá
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaOk. I‚Äôm confused. All I‚Äôm seeing here is trailers.  Where are the movies.?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaNow more than ever people need to see this movie. I wish they would show it Katie Porter style in the U.S. Congress.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaJust fall down the stairs
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaCant believe the comments that still ignore this deeply, for way too long rooted problem in our society that women cant decide over their own body. This movie is incredibly intense and should show that women must have the right for legal abortion. But the way the protagonist had to handle hers is the actual problem. NOT the ‚Äûimmoral decision‚Äú , not the premarital sex, not ‚Äûnot having a specific motive like rape‚Äú, but the lack of a basic human right, for all women. Our right of choice goes before anybody elses when its about our own body.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaI watched that yesterday and now I am convinced. They are right. Human before is born, before start to be part of the society isn&#39;t a human. Is actually a piece of dirt. let&#39;s kill all unborn I guess ü§î
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaA movie about murdering a baby fantastic.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie. Great story.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaSupreme court justice&#39;s should get a special screening.  Cant wait to watch.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaabortion is a crime. this kind of movies just mislead woman. abortion is not a solution, its the killing of an innocent life.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitai‚Äôm sorry but abortion shouldn‚Äôt be legal unless you‚Äôre a r@pe victim if your a woman who sleeps around it‚Äôs nobody else‚Äôs fault but your own let the child live üíÄ
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitahow did she get pregnant?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaAccurately depicts the dystopian nightmare that the GOP has been working hard to create for a long time now.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaProbably an easy foreign language Oscar nod next year
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaIts called NO SELF WORTH/ Insulting yourself by always settling for way Less/  Downgrading your own Life.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll keep rewatching Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always until this movie is available in my area.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaTiming is very fortuitous, almost like this is planned out.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaüá®üáµüõµü•ê‚òï
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaOh wow I didn‚Äôt know that voluntarily having unprotected sex led to pregnancy ü§î... and willing to kill the unborn baby is a moral rightü§î. The world we live in üòè.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaAnd right when people need it most
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaOh no this narrative has been done to a death, please can we focus on what&#39;s real in 2022?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshita&#39;Abortion is the Antichrist&#39;s demonic parody of the Eucharist. That&#39;s why it uses the same holy words, &quot;This is my body,&quot; with the blasphemous opposite meaning.&#39;<br><br>Peter Kreeft
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitadefinitely on my watchlist.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaSlick. Worthy of Capra or Riefenstahl, who, of course, had narratives to spin  for their respective target audiences as well. Perhaps only a French film could be unabashed enough to cut to the core surrounding this issue. Our heroine isn‚Äôt the favoured extreme case  of more squeamish Anglo audiences. On the contrary, a sexually liberated pioneer of the self actualised, current year, ideal Marxist-feminist western everywoman is presented to the audience. The central conflict of the piece, the fact that she is meant to have licence while at the same time she also has no licence - she is meant to be oppressed, after all - will always be tough to represent due to cognitive dissonance being hard to capture on celluloid. On the one hand she is clearly an agent who acts with agency, she is studying with a view to exploiting the capitalist system to improve her social standing (aspirations) and she is capable of initiating a sexual relationship - overtly sexual, even, perhaps, after all there‚Äôs no long term goal beyond the sex, so way to simulate pioneering third wave, sister. On the other hand, she ‚Äûfalls‚Äú pregnant, which is a concept, which needs to be unwrapped. How could this have happened? Clearly for the sophisticated audience this does not require much in the way of explication.<br>Yet the filmmakers chose the 60s as their setting. France‚Äòs insurance system covered use of the pill from 1964 onwards, it‚Äôs use was enshrined in law by 1967. Condoms and other forms of prophylactic were readily available in France, which had ceased to be socially conservative after the end of the last war. So, how does one ‚Äûfall‚Äú pregnant if one is at the same time a fully self actualised feminist protagonist? Well clearly the patriarchy is to blame for this sorry state of affairs. Pregnancy, which may or may not have some direct correlation with intercourse, is terribly oppressive if it happens to you when you can‚Äôt be asked. Clearly then the solution must be an abortion and clearly something as pesky as a legal code can only serve as a foil against which the true image of the fully self actualised protagonist can be allowed to take shape. After all, the young woman could face having to dial down those aspirations if the unwanted pregnancy comes to term, while the chances of going to jail as a result of the illegally procured abortion ‚Ä¶ performative contradiction ‚Ä¶ never mind‚Ä¶ moving on ‚Ä¶ clearly again we see chauvinism at work. Grotesque. So of course the law must be changed. Are we not lucky that young women can have unprotected sex to their heart‚Äôs content and get rid of any inconvenient accidents along the way. Truly a triumph of modern man. Thank you France for producing directors capable of getting to the point on this one, like only you can. A triumph of total lack of ambiguity. Truly transcendent. This is what a victory lap looks like boys and girls.
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshita&quot;Retarded and stunningly egoistical&quot; My Review (R)
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaI still don&#39;t get it and I get almost every movie...wowow
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaIt reminds me of ‚Äú4 months 3weeks2days&quot;.. great movie
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitafinally, been reading great things about the movie. can&#39;t wait to watch it!
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaMarvel studios has gotten weird
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaThe Coat Hanger 2022
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaWhy have premarital affair in first place?
HAQVYYqj3RodelimeterByIshitaIntresting
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitai believe kurt russel can bring back western genre great again
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaDid I just watch a trailer that showed every character death... ok
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Kurt Russell is getting some extra mileage out of his Hateful 8 moustache.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaWyatt Earp is going to be in new movie...playing a Sheriff?
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaI thought he was dead.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaWyatt Earp and his epic moustache ride again!

0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaMatthew Fox, good to see him acting again
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaReturn to form for Matthew Fox? It just might be.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitamaybe you need to not give away so much in the trailer. this seems to be a pattern in Hollywood, there&#39;s no mystery left. I wish I could do your job, just without the studio forcing your hand.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaYep
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, but it felt like it was two minutes long....
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaDiscount Chris Pratt
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitalooks like a warm up before the hateful 8
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaHmmmm...interesting.....
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaFrom the thumbnail I thought this was the trailer for....yup, you guessed it....Cool Runnings.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaKurt is hurt.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaEat a stick Russell

0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaInteresting cast
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaWhat might be the story be about? Bandits?
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucks
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m loving all these new modern westerns coming out. Slow West was good. Still wanting to see The Salvation with Mads Mikkelsen.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaMatthew Fox!!!!!
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaShame they couldn&#39;t have added Daniel Day... Bill, &#39;The Butcher&#39; was made for this.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaThat mustache tells me that this must be the prequel for his character in Hateful 8.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitacannibalistic natives?   I hope its not going to end that way
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitawat
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaWow! What a deepthroath at the end!
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaI saw Kurt Russell and thought thought that it was the second Hateful Eight trailer
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaYup Patrick Wilson is the bad guy, too easy Hollywood.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaIs this a western or a horror movie?<br>Yes.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaAt last! The western movie! Yay!
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cowboy movie from the Dark Side...I&#39;ll give it a shot. (I just hope it isn&#39;t ruined by a sunny ending.)
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaA directorial debut of a western starring Kurt Russel, Matthew Fox and Patrick Wilson setting out to save captives from a group of cannibalistic natives? Yep sign me up, even if the trailer was a bit &#39;iffy&#39;. <br><br>Looks like westerns are making a comeback and Kurt Russel is at the forefront.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaI that gave away a unacceptable amount of information about the movie.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitamoar spoilers please
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaits cash
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaKurt+Western=One Ticket Please.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaOooh. Looks interesting. I think they all go crazy cause their on Indian territory, perhaps they get cursed and start killing each other. I like where this is going...and Kurt Russel (aka: Wyatt Erp).
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaStranger: &quot;Dont be scared. I am a friend&quot;<br>Fox: &quot;No you aren&#39;t...BANG BANG BANG!&quot;<br><br>(Yes imagine him actually saying &quot;bang bang&quot;) Gangster shit!
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitadamn!  is this another Cormac Mccarthy book?!<br>It just looks so raw.

0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaKurt Russell pretty much disappears for 15 years, and now he&#39;s doing two movies this year? Hell yeah.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaSo happy to see a new Kurt Russell film.
0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshita&quot;If you want to question my morals, do it later&quot;  =))

0ZbwtHi-KSEdelimeterByIshitaKurt Russel was just looking for a movie that allowed him to keep his facial hair from Hateful 8

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitawell congratulations. 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a sad show
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaGuys is it worthing watching ?? Please answer because am thinking to buy it on itunes !!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita;(
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathis is sad
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaBruno looks like my little cousin
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaAmo esta pel√≠cula
Mehace llorar cada vez que la veo.‚ô°=):)
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaHe
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaWhat the school books won&#39;t tell you is how 2 million of our people (assuming that you are German) were killed in Yugoslavia AFTER the war ended.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched this at school last year,I can&#39;t forget it
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIf shmuel and Bruno didn&#39;t become friends than this wouldn&#39;t have been a book
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaOmg this is the saddest movie I practically cried through the whole thing :&#39;( 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched this today at school
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI had to watch the movie at school today
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitai cried at the end when Bruno and Smo(sorry if i spelt his name wrong lol) died :( ...Hitler..what a wicked man you were ! &gt;:(
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI agree, after seeing the ending, I began to wonder &quot;What if Bruno and Shumel never became friends?&quot; Then what would happen? I think Bruno would have lived while Shumel still died just because Hitler wanted to create a &quot;perfect&quot; Germany to avenge it&#39;s defeat during the last war. But I don&#39;t care about the book&#39;s themes because I understand that we are all human beings (sometimes). But still if those two never became friends, Bruno&#39;s life could have been saved.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most sad movies I have ever seen in my life. I cried when Bruno lied on the boy, and at the end. Really makes me sad to see all that the Jewish people have suffered. 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaAha, you&#39;re not funny!

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie made me go to Germany and walk up to hitlers door and shoot him but that was a wile ago
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitai would love to find this on netflix or somewhere on line to view for free, as a senior I can&#39;t afford to buy movies. anybody know where to find it??
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaso happy to hear that young people are still being encouraged to read that which is factual, and not just what is fictional. i cherish the good books I read in school that woke me up to the realities of the world.  then i determined to fight against wickedness, as I suggest all do the same!!  I would not be here if my mother had not survived the London bombings in WW2.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitatell your mom that hiding children from sadness is the way they can grow up to be the perpetrators of wickedness. Sadness is part of life, and we SHOULD witness that which should NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThanks bro
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitayes he is
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitano its ur mom

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitahey that&#39;s not very nice.

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Prisoner and Paper Plane
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThanks for ruining it. Wow.

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched the movie and read the book and made me cry üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita: (
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie a couple of years ago and sobbed so hard and for so long my mom made me stop watching movies for a while. I could barely get through the trailer just now. I guess its a good movie but it just makes me so angry. I really want to read the book but every time i go into Barnes and Noble and see the cover I can&#39;t bring myself to do it.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t read comments below. spoilers gonna spoil!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaya me to
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie in school.. it was sooo sad :&#39;/ sometimes i just cant belive some of the shit our country has done.....
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaSaddest thing is I didn&#39;t cry. :(
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitawow the trailer is better then the  movie
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to see the move don&#39;t read the comment under mine
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaPinkgirl1037 what is it about
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaOh my.. this is the saddest movie ever!! The end is just sad :&#39;( made me cry!!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Remus Lupin! :P
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitahmm.. concentration camps usually have guards looking at their prisoners most of the time..I don&#39;t think an eight yr old boy can sneak so  close to the fence and a German boy can talk to him...
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaits the sadest movie ever! and its the best! &lt;3
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks sad but is it good? I&#39;m on the fence.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaCant wait to see it!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI cried so hard when i saw this. Its horrific how cruel the Nazis were.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitait makes me upset on how cruel some people could be... they might as well be a demon
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched the whole movie on youtube
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI think some people misunderstood the movie. It&#39;s about HISTORY, this doesn&#39;t happen anymore, and Germans don&#39;t hate Jews. And Nazis =/= Germans. (I&#39;m not German myself, if anyone&#39;s wondering.)
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitabest film ever made
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitabest film ever. but i find what they did to them disgusting and i struggle to watch the end
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@singdancerokk123 god isn&#39;t real
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@AliceakaTaezen mee too

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@souloggirl13 that is very true, this movie was touching
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitai watched the movie today at the college and it was sooo sad, i didnt cry because i never do but my heart was pounding really hard when i was watching it . and now i understand better why the Bible says that if we don&#39;t have a  kids heart we wont go to heaven...
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaWe read the book in 5 grade but I had already read the book in 4. Although I&#39;m in 7 grade now I will not watch the movie because I know what will happen
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@ipodfreak898 lol who the fuck believes that? never heard of it. where do you live?
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie! I love WW2 movies, but there is something so remarkable about seeing the world through a children&#39;s eyes. :-) 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the only movie that has ever made me cry.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@singdancerokk123 I was with you until you started a sentence with GOD...
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI think I can&#39;t watch this seriously, there is Remus Lupin here :DDD
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI was crying at the end. This movie was so sad and it breaks my heart how people were and still are, so cruel&lt;/3
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathis film hits home hard for any jewish people :(
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaMy teacher is reading this book to us in school
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathis movie was a sad which made it the beat movie going
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@singdancerokk123 how dare you compare god to slaverous humans like our selves, i know ur tryna make a good point but you&#39;re speaking out to people here, people listen, if u are to believe in god then do not make it seem as if god is in anything like us.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@NightX14 And concentration camps with its unsanitary-ness and diseases. 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaBeautifuuul movie!!!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaDude your are so right about the BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS THING PLEASE SUBSCRIBE ME!
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@ralphy6666 actually him and his wife both took a pill and then he shot her and then himself after that the germans burned there bodies so the army wouldn&#39;t have no evidence of him
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@NightX14 he shot himself... then got blown the fuck up..
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathis movie was really good. i bawled mt eyes out...
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathere&#39;s nothing wrong with the spelling...pyjamas and pajamas are both right..why care about d spelling?focus on d movie instead...
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitathey spelt pyjamas wrong whilst making the film :)
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@cinman17 well it wouldnt be fair to have german people with english subtitles , all of the actors are british , exept for the mother , she&#39;s american in real life 
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaDavid Thewlis is a nazi . . . . . .I knew it! jk lol he&#39;s awesome :)
this is a really sad movie, but it&#39;s really good
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good... but the title just ruins everything... LOL
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie it&#39;s so good
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@13thTry Okay, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you or anything. I never did anything like that as well, cause I wasn&#39;t born yet. But don&#39;t you feel strange when other people still call us Germans &quot;Navis&quot;...Fortunately not everybody talks that way...Same is with the Spanish and Franco...Maybe ashamed is the wrong word, but aren&#39;t you feeling a little bad as well?
Maybe I&#39;m just too emotional.
Anyway, it was not my intention to make you angry or anything else, okay?
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaJUST ABOUT 2 LUK AT IT!
ANY GUD LADS??
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI nearly cried at the end so sad serious must watch movie anyone that disagres has no heart
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitai read the book before i saw this today. i actually preferred the movie because the visual dynamics were stunning. words can&#39;t describe how flawless and emotionally gripping this was. it left me shaking by the end. this is the kind of movie you can only watch once in a long time. however, i highly recommend it because it has got to be some of the best work i&#39;ve seen in a while.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitai just watched this movie today. i thought it was better than the book since the visual dynamics were stunning. overall, words can&#39;t describe how emotionally gripping the whole story is. it left me shaking at the end.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita I am GERMAN! And I just meant me saying that about shame directly . And I know so many people that feel the same way. When we think back to those times we are really shocked how anything like that could happen...How we let that happen.Every child learns the German history in school...So everybody kinda gets in touch with it
Maybe there is a manority that thinks differently but most of us are doing everything to erase the story from our minds
Sorry if I was too harsh
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI never, and I mean NEVER cry in movies. But oh my gosh, after seeing this, I was completely sobbing. I recommend everyone watch this movie its so great.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so sad and at the same time so bittersweet. The friendship of the two boys *cry*
I was completely in tears when I had finished watching it
In that moment all Germans must shake their head and ask theirselves how this could ever happen, right?
Sometimes you really feel shame as a German citizen

9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitacried my ass off watching this:,,,,(
sis this movie win an award cuz it should
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@radioobeats i just think hes plain evil... im not sure
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@GoldenSun96 agree 100%
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshita@Cutipi108 they stayed in the room because they got poisoned with gas cuz they say &quot; theyre getting a shower&quot; but there getting poisoned with gas and bruno died.
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaThe ending to this movie KILLED me! SO SAD!
To me the ending came to soon snd I was dieing to see what happened next
: (
9ypMp0s5HiwdelimeterByIshitaI really want to buy the book and c the movie. watching this makes it sound soo good!!

PsD0NpFSADMdelimeterByIshitazooey is so smokin hot
PsD0NpFSADMdelimeterByIshitaHuge fan of Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  This also looks like the best &quot;rom-com&quot; since, well, Harry Met Sally, because I am a huge fan of that movie.

Also, what he draws on her arm, the partial cityscape, is so rad that I would want a tattoo like that in the same place on my forearm.
PsD0NpFSADMdelimeterByIshitaThey filmed some of this movie right outside of my house, on wilshire. I asked one of the crew who was going to be in it and they told me to piss off. I laughed and left.
PsD0NpFSADMdelimeterByIshitahaha.. just the same to me..
PsD0NpFSADMdelimeterByIshitaand just when i&#39;m tryin to get over my infatuation with zooey... this movie comes along...

OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe tagline should read, &quot;Its a Bitch&quot;
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaGuys! Cuaron said that there will be no sound in the movie when it&#39;s released!! stop making a big deal about it!!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitai thought this was a joke
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaAT 327 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH
THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND
NO AIR PRESSURE
NO CONVENIENCE STORES

LIFE IN SPACE IS IMPOSSIBLE
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaInsane.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe director said that the trailers will feature sound, but the actual movie won&#39;t. Gotta get people in the seats.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaYou are a massive tool.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, Sandra&#39;s &quot;screaming&quot; or hearing debris and explosions in space movies...
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThere is O2 in her suit still so that is carrying the sound
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitafuck that feeling dude. damnnn
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaokay that looks fucking awesome.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaStill wanna go out in space?
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaLOOKS horrifying 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re right, they never would have made it into space to begin with.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitarelax and have a Snicker :)
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita&quot;Ugh... ahh... ahhh! UHCK! AhhhhhUGH! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ughghgh!&quot;

Sandra Bullock
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita&quot;Ahh ahh huu huu uhh uuhh aaaahh haaa huuh huh huh huh huuuuhhhh ahh ahh uh uh!&quot;
-10/10
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita–ö—Ä—É—Ç–æ! –í IMAX –∂–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç?
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe movie that I most want to watch this year. Here in Brazil the premiere will be in October, I barely can wait for it.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita1:29 Jesus!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI really want to love this movie...but after 2 minutes, I was already sick of Bullock&#39;s screaming. Not sure how I&#39;ll make it through 2 hours.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaNone of this would have happened if Jebidiah were commander.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI love space.  I really wanted to like this, but at about 30 seconds I realized it was Sandra Bullock in that suit and from that point forward I just wanted her to shut up.  I want to be positive, but this is kinda like spoiled milk all over your favorite cereal.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIs there a plot?
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaLooks like a 3D gimmick to me.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitalol
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaDid anybody else laugh through out the whole trailer? 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaNope its 2048x1080, the standard 1080p is 1920x1080, so we aren&#39;t missing out on much if we have a 1080p monitor :D
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaFirst all there was from all trailers is Sandra bullock moaning and screaming
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t actually see how it&#39;s a movie.     :-/
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI think the idea that space can kill you at any moment and to survive you absolutely need the help of someone else is an idea worth regarding. This may be a subject that has been explored before, but not like this. The &quot;perils of space&quot; you talk about are very real and tangible, and that makes it important to explore.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaMine does, but my monitor doesn&#39;t :/
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaBroke my moon dream
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks suspenseful
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita1:53 fart
2:00 fart
2:06 fart
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI just played 1080p, crossed my eyes and watched it in 2k and 3d!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaÎ≠êÏßÄ? Ïù¥Îü∞Í±¥ Íº≠ Î¥êÏïºÌï¥!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI know that there was a comment that some of the SFX for the crashes in the earlier trailers are JUST in the trailers, and not in the actual film, since they&#39;re going for that element of hard scifi realism.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThat is my worst nightmare
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI saw a different trailer for this Film when I saw &quot;Elysium&quot; at the theater a few weeks back. Now that I have seen both trailers, I still do not have the faintest clue what this movie might be about.... other than knowing parts of it take place in space, and the people who made the two trailers obviously have little or no idea how physics, orbital mechanics, friction, or momentum actually work.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitawhat a troll he is
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita2k!! HAppy to have an iMac 27&quot;
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaps.  I&#39;m still looking forward to it!  Alfonso Cuaron is amazing, but Cameron is just...well...James Cameron doesn&#39;t do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is James Cameron!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitayea, because it&#39;s in 3d and Cameron has a financial stake in the equipment.  It&#39;s the same thing Cameron did for Hugo.   
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaAH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AH 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaLike his opinion matters.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI want to see this movie so bad, even Robot Actcress Sandra  AH AH AH AH Bullock can&#39;t stop me.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaA movie with an idea worth regarding. Not just about the &#39;unknown&#39; or &#39;dangerous situations&#39; or &#39;adrenalin&#39; or &#39;the perils of space&#39;.

OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThis is why women shouldn&#39;t be allowed in space.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaWhat the hell constitutes a &quot;brainy&quot; sci-fi movie?
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t worry. It&#39;s barely an extra thousand pixels you&#39;re missing out on.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaForget horror movies. this right here is my worst nightmare.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaSpace junk flies at thousands of miles per hour and would shred anything it touched.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe director has said they added sound for the explosions in the trailer, but they won&#39;t be in the final film.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a lot of moaning.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIt looks fake... And... Pleease, pleease do not make sci-fi movies that is base on the &#39;thrills&#39; or &#39;perils&#39; of space... This is so old fashioned. Please make &#39;brainy&#39; sci-fi movies...
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita1:30 - 2:14 Looks like Alien.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaWhelp. This is why I&#39;ll let someone else be an astronaut.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaWhich is why I never aspired to be an Astronaut. 

OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitagoddamnit, 2 minutes later
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita1:38 WALL-E
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaher character looks so obnoxious 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThis 2K is amazing!!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe sound is only for the trailer. In the movie it will be silent
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita1:38 WAAAAAAALLLLLEEEEEEEE
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaAssumedly, it&#39;s the impact that they hear inside of the suit from the objects bumping into them. The debris doesn&#39;t make any noise, but impact to the suit would transfer sound inside it.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita&quot;The best space film ever done&quot; 

James Cameron _after watching this movie
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitawhat I was thinking
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaChills....
I wanna see this now!!

OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaDude I challenge you to be put in a multi axis trainer with a mask over your face, blindfolded, and spun around at 2g&#39;s and see you remain silent.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaholy t*ts 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaWhat a gruntfest. 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIt takes time to render.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita*heavy breathing*
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe music and sounds are just in the trailer. In the actual film non of that will be there, I guess.

OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaAmazing 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaSo, this is a truly scary an thrilling movie
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaNo you are not...
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaSo, this is a truly scary an thrilling movie
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaGet a retina display and max out the res using third party software... 3K ^^,
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaI hope they keep teasing us like this, it makes it interesting
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaBest thriller in 50 yrs, we have never experienced this.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIf you notice, those sounds are actually background music + from her microphone.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIf I want to hear this much grunting, I&#39;ll just watch some porn.  Looks like a movie with a shitty plot.  
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshita4/10 Can&#39;t wait!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaNo sound in space.

Trailer is noisy as hell.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaIntense...
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaWould you prefer for them to film in space?
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaC-A-R-A-L-H-O
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaNICE GREEN SCREEN
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaSo it doesn&#39;t seem like gets lost in space after all.
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaJust .......Wow !
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaGoosebumps everywhere. And goosebumps don&#39;t make a sound in space either. 
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaAND THE OSCAR GOES TO........... SANDRA BULLOCK!!! FOR GRAVITY!
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaoscar
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaSPAIN
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaThe first trailer of this got my heart pumping they should definitely make this movie
OiTiKOy59o4delimeterByIshitaGeorge Cloony&#39;s best role other than Batman!
