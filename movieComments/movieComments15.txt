Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaRIP Christopher Plummer 🌹
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawho is here after his Death ?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaRIP Doctor
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita“The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus”.  Sounds like the title of a Frank Zappa song.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp is the best ❤️
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawhat a huge pile of vomit  ;)
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI really want to watch this also hi Johny Depp pirates of the Caribbean say hi the Davy for me
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaCame out in 2009 🎭
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaMasonic movie
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaIts a Brilliant and Odd movie.  Some people can understand it, and others not!.....I love the concept/plot....💯❣
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHeath Ledger has more screen time in The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus than he does in The Dark Knight. <br><br>Heath Ledger&#39;s screen time as The Joker, in The Dark Knight is 35 minutes.<br><br>Heath Ledger&#39;s screen time as Tony, in The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus is 40 minutes.<br><br>So people who haven&#39;t seen Doctor Parnassus, it&#39;s not like Heath Ledger is in it, and then at the halfway point of the film his gone. No, Heath Ledger basically comes in to the film, about 15 to 20 minutes in, and Heath Ledger appears in the film essentially from then until the last 15 to 20 minutes. So yes it&#39;s worth while seeing.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaJude Law Johnny Deep Colin Farrell and Heath Ledger all in one film, and this story line was entertaining.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY I FOUND YOU !
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaJust watched it.. never heard of it.. such a good film!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaSuch a powerhouse cast, Heath Ledger&#39;s last movie that he wasn&#39;t even able to see through to the end, and hardly anyone has heard of it.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaSrry for poor inglés, Vhen were you when heat legend dies?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitahow is the best quality available in 240p?!!? these graphics from 2009 are absolute shit
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaLove the music that&#39;s playing. Anyone know the name of it?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita240p so we meet again ...
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaIm watching this.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita2020 everyone. What a fantastic film. 🥳
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaWhy does the first guy that goes through the mirror face change???? Please explain!!!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaRip Heath Ledger 1979-2008 and Rip Verne Troyer 1969-2018 10 years apart
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThe Sally Jesse Raphael show told Justin cogo to act bad,act bad for the camera, and offered him a pack of cigarettes in NY in 1995 behind his parents back.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitajoker went out with a joke
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHeath Ledger was in a white suit and white mask when he shot his last scene. If he wasn’t wearing a mask, they couldn’t have introduced other actors. Because the mask was there, in the next scene the other actors could take off the mask and introduce themselves as different people in another world. RIP Heath Ledger, you made yourself a legend, even through the symbolism of your death.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaDo ppl know 😳 the Is devil fake 😒 so make it make sense 🚮
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaTerry Gilliam is God
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else find it funny that Tom Waitts, the guy that Heath Ledger modelled the Joker voice off of, is playing in a film with Heath Ledger?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaEveryone thinks Heath passed away during The Dark Knight but he actually passed during the filming of this movie, which was much longer after TDK. I&#39;m thinking both roles could have fucked him up a little or just so much work and no sleep instead using Xanax.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThis kind of movies is not for us ... we are not part of the public that the directors focus on.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaR I p Heath and Verne
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaIt took me so long to find this movie again, the only thing I could remember was the swing and the mirror but could never remember the title. So glad I found it again.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitabyłem w kinie sam, 400km od domu, coś chciałem obejrzeć, zasnąłem w trakcie pijany... 10 lat minęło a ciągle pamiętam tą scene... tego pijaka, który wchodzi po schodach i tonie w butelkach... Motyw starszego gościa który <br>uwodzi młodszą dziewczynę aby ją wykorzystać utkwił mi w głowie... zbieg okoliczności... ze akurat tam w tym miasteczku ona zmieniała moje życie...
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaRIP Heath n Verne
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaVerne and heath rest in peace
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHeath Ledger😊Love you❤
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitarip heath the best best best joker ever made will miss you 😢😢
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaSony pictures must be behind the satanic blood sacrifice of leger
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI have looked for this movie for the past 5 years. I saw it one on TV, and fell in love  with  it. I am so happy I have  found  it.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaZero mention of fetus Andrew Garfield lol
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawhy does this look like it was filmed on a potato.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaWatch this tripping on acid. You won’t be disappointed.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThis should have been Called, <b>Terry Gilliams, The Imagination of WTF is going on in Doctor Parsnips wizard of oz mind</b>
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is rubbish.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI remember this movie not being very good. I think people really wanted it to be good because of Heath Ledger.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI love that they used different actors for the same role. It’s so creative, and not easily spotted. It emphasises the “dreamscape, nothing is as it seems” trope that it possesses. Awesome job. XD
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawhy so low res tho
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThis film is memorable with good acting &amp; actors.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaGoing go see on Netflix tonight..it&#39;s movie night bitches..can&#39;t wait..
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know the score to this trailer?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqe85ffv9-w&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> All three actors are in The Fantastic Beasts series. Makes you wonder if Heath would&#39;ve had a similar role if he was still alive.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHeath ledger😊🌟🌟🌟
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaGeorges...
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI DONT KNOW
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHow have I never seen this?<br>That&#39;s such a great cast! I also love that Tom Waits is the devil. Haha
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaMust see this now...
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqe85ffv9-w&amp;t=0m45s">0:45</a> That world looks a Mario Party game board.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a massive pile of crap what a waist of casting talent and money
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaMy thoughts when I&#39;m high
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thinks that Lily Cole is quite underated in this trailer? I mean her role is essential for the storyline and her name does&#39;nt even appear? Seems like you already have to be famous to get credits..
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaLucid Dreaming ........................................
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHave more Tim Burton&#39;s style than the last Tim Burton&#39;s movies XD
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawho&#39;s here because red velvet rookie mv ? hahaha
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitawatching this because of red velvet&#39;s rookie
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitai love this movie
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitasuch a tremendous trailer.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaany1 know the song from the music box?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaWow. It&#39;s an elite freemason&#39;s playground in this one
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fuckin trippy nuts. Can&#39;t wait to watch it. :D
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaAAWWW miss u Heath &gt;_&lt; fantastic movie i`m shure...and well THE BEST JOKER of batman (AND LAST)
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita.-. everything&#39;s a thousand years ago these days.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@drinkupXgorgeous Thank you, I know that now. I made that comment over a year ago.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@booksandvideos that was johnny depp not heath
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaOk, people, I get it! It wasn&#39;t Heath talking. I&#39;m still receiving messages a year after I made that mistake.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@booksandvideos That&#39;s Johnny, not Heath.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@malakus 
Probably, they were both directed by Terry Gilliam. :D
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@booksandvideos 
That was an ad-lib that Heath asked Terry Gilliam about adding, just before he died, and after, when Johnny came in to film his part for Heath, he suggested the line to them without knowing that Heath had said it before.
Which was kinda spooky.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitatoo bad being the last movie for heath ... worst movie ever
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P HEATH LEDGER 
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaJust me or The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is pretty alike to The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen???
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita...waiting for the &quot;twitter on the 50inch flat screen&quot; ad to hurry up and end...sooo i guess walking over to the computer just doesn&#39;t fly anymore...i guess it makes sense for all the fat asses that just wanna live life through their tv
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitayou must know a lot about fingers .  What can I say. Some guys are the prince of our dreams and others (your group) , the frogs.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@fwaggylover  he did but his part in this movie  filmed befor he died!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaWhy collin farell
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaOMG i saw this movie it was amazing go see it!!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshita@TheChaosjin he died before it was finished.. thats why they have the other three actors
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitajohney depp, jude law and colin farell all filled in 4 free after heath passed away as a tribute 2 him.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitacan anyone say &quot;K&quot; HOLE?!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaAre you serious? Well, never mind then.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaHe doesn&#39;t say it, Johnny Depp does. xD
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaIt is released in New York and Los Angeles on December 25th but released nationwide on January 8th. (:
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaIt is released in New York and Los Angeles on December 25th but released nationwide on January 8th. (:
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else find it ironic that this was Heath&#39;s last movie and in the trailer he says, &quot;Nothing is permanent, not even death&quot;?
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI wish that heat L. , Jhonny  &amp; Jude were on another type of movie. I love them!
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitalooks wonderful, except for johnny depp and the computer animation...
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitahey, it&#39;s better than going out on brokeback mountain.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see Heath Ledger on the stage, again and for the last time.
Iqe85ffv9-wdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaCan I like this 100 times? One of my top ten books ever.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaLooks wonderful, will be looking for it on DVD when it&#39;s available.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@SniperLi0n You should read the classic book before ever attempting to watch the movie.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaanother version! God I dont get tired of it. Although Im not sure its gonna be that good....
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitais it scary, romantic, or idk what else
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaLove this book will have to see this movie
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@violinhero62 Go to the film&#39;s official site (Focus Features) and click &#39;Find Theatres.&#39;  I tried to post the direct link, but YouTube is being annoying.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d regrettably never actually read Jane Eyre, so I just started reading it, and now I find out they&#39;re making a new movie version!! From the beginning (which I&#39;ve read) to the point where she is at the school it actually seems like it&#39;s very true to the book... that would be refreshing :) 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaLol I JUST finished reading this book yesterday and now I find out there is a movie?I MUST SEE
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitayoutube.com/watch?v=jNAGz7WdGIU
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita=NsX4jFjUtg8 its a realy funny skit
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaDude, the only reason I&#39;d want to see it is cause &quot;The Weather People&quot; is used in the trailer. : )
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaOther than the Goblins music, does anyone know what pieces are used in this trailer?
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI just watched Jane Eyre for the first time on netfliz and loved it and now im reading the book. I think this new movie looks very dramatic  but it looks good none the lease
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@seeyaspacecowboy yeah mia wasikowska.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@seeyaspacecowboy Yep :)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaYes! I&#39;ve gotta see this, even if it turns out to be an &#39;ehh&#39; list film. :)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t freaking wait!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaUpon re-reading the source material, its apparent every cinematic version has changed the tones and themes of the story slightly.  Some make him more brutish, some more vulnerable.  I think the thing is to let it be a different story, not make it alike the novel, as it just couldn&#39;t be.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitathe other Jane Eyre wasn&#39;t good enough for everyone? i like that one...
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@jglass54 Agreed! After watching that miniseries, no other Jane Eyre is good enough. Nobody beats Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens as Rochester and Jane. And this one... made me a little sad. Nobody seems to have the passion required.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaNobody beats Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester... so I&#39;m a bit disappointed with the Rochester they&#39;ve chosen here. (He doesn&#39;t look grim or turbulent at ALL) And from the trailer, I&#39;m not so sure about Mia as Jane, either. She doesn&#39;t seem passionate enough. Still, I might watch this, if only for Judi Dench. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitai heard about jane eyre by watching pheanus and pherb lol
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaOh god, this looks... iffy. I&#39;m not impressed with how she spoke the &quot;poor, obscure, plain, and little&quot; line. Supposed to be way more passionate than that. But still, I&#39;ll give the movie a shot. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMia Wasikowska is 21 years old.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI love the story of Jane Eyre and I have seen every version of it. I am, however, a little put off at how young this Jane looks. She literally looks 13. Don&#39;t know if I can get into this movie when Mr. Rochester will look like a pedophile to me.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaTo me, the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens mini-series is THE definitive version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.  Ruth Wilson was superb and nominated for an Emmy.  Based on the trailer, I don&#39;t have much hope for this version.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaSeen every version readily available.  My favorite is the Masterpiece Theatre version from 2006 (Toby Stevens).  LOVE the casting of Judy Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.  Kind of understated for such a grand dame (literally), but them so was her performance in the Keira Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice.  


8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaooo what is this rated? i totally want to see it now! :D
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@JacobGrimmFollower - Looks like it&#39;ll be a good movie, but I agree, the &quot;poor, plain&quot; bit was a bit insipid compared to the BBC version!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@sorchasswans Also? Judi Dench. JUDI DENCH! APPROVE.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that it opened with the lines from her childhood and actually touches on a lot of the important things that happen to her as a girl (Not just starting at the red room) makes me excited. None of the other movies I&#39;ve watched do that. This looks REALLY promising! LITERATURE NERD GIRL SQUEE!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI wish this version would have been out when I had to read this in high school.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI remember reading this. How the book descirbed that &quot;ghost&quot; scared me bit.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaShe looks so heartbreakingly young.  It makes Jane&#39;s choices seem all the more  brave.  I love it!  Can&#39;t wait!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to pee....read it 8 times. LOVE YOU CHARLOTTE BRONTE!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@yasafitraf Wait till you&#39;ve actually seen the movie first before declaring Stephens to be a &quot;better&quot; Rochester.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@yasafitraf Blanche&#39;s hair is black in the book.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaSince when Ms Blanche Ingram dying her hair into black? 
And... Toby Stephen more better and cooler as Mr Rochester.
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see it.  My English Honors class just got done reading this.  It looks very accurate and close to the book. Very interesting
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaAhhhh! Can&#39;t waitt! :D
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@TheRealPiper101 Me to. That was the first version of Jane Eyre I ever saw. It remains my favorite.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaFinally, a Miss Ingram who isn&#39;t a blonde! lol 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@MarleyVK 
Actually, I find it rather refreshing that, for once, a woman doesn&#39;t have to look like a model and a man like a monster.  It makes it more real to me. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI saw the trailer in the theater for the first time when it was playing behind Country Strong two weeks ago. Needless to say, it was better than the movie.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@Moviewhiz1 

It was boring cos you were forced to read it; english lit classes can butcher great literature because of that, and poor teaching (in some cases) and the constraints of the national curriculum. If taken the time to be appreciated, the book is amazing, heart wrenching, passionate and thrilling.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@Moviewhiz1 
The book is far from being boring!!! 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaThe 2006 version will always have an advantage because you can include a lot more of the story in a 4-hour miniseries. We&#39;ll be lucky if the new film even tops two hours.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaSO EXCITED!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaOmg my English class is going to see this when it comes out because we&#39;re reading the book and this movie looks AWESOME!!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT TO SEE THIS
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMICHAEL FASSBENDER, YESSSSSSS
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaawesome casting with michael fassbender, mia wasikowska, and judi dench. it looks like this version is going to be really creepy. i always thought the adaptations weren&#39;t scary enough.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaIt will take me a while to get use to this version - I&#39;m in love with the 2006 BBC adaptation - but it actually looks good. (I love that Jamie Bell got a part in it!)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitathis movie might even be better than the 2006 version i think thats which year) im pleased to say that the dialogue is rather similar to the actual script, and this i am excited to see this movie. EEEEEEP!!! i also love the casting :) somewhat :O haha im so excited!!!!!!!!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitathe plain and obscure scene doesnt feel or seem as powerful as the 2006 adaptation...i hope this version isn&#39;t a disappointment. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@Lakota828 thx for the reply! guess we&#39;ll find out soon while watching the movie :) hope it&#39;s gonna be as good as the last Jane..
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMichael Fassbender is 99x better looking than this Jane. I dont see how they could be good together...
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like how Mr Rochester is incredibly more good looking than Jane. They need a better looking Jane... Not a new Rochester, I love Michael Fassbender! He&#39;s orgasmic.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@lllilith   (spoiler alert?)  I could be wrong, but I would assume it was for the part where he is blind and Jane comes back.  Why they would use that look is beyond me, but I would imagine that is the reason for the &quot;black eyes.&quot;  
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMr. Rochester seems too nice.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s with the black eyes of Rochester? :|
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaCant wait for this movie. Im not a fan of the girl they roled for Jane, but I&#39;ll give her a shot since I love this book o so much.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitagreat book!! hopefully the movie will be too!! :)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitathis is so hollywood. glamourised and unecessarily dramatised jane eyre.........
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaHopefully the March release date will mean that folks will flock to this and ignore the silly &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; in the process. Give me Mia over Amanda Seyfried any day of the week.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitai love the book so much i have read it over and over! i have never seen any shows or movies of it, so this will be refreshing...i hope. im so excited.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitajane eyre without ruth and toby.... is not jane eyre :( 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@Dem192 I&#39;m reading it right now and I&#39;m stuck TT.TT But I&#39;m at the beginning too sooo lol
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI love ever version of this movie that I have ever scene, but this one looks like it is going to be the best. I am so excited. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI call the 2006 version the best, in my opinion.
But I shall have to see this one too, of course. :)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita&quot;There had to be lots of love in the air, but I&#39;m not seeing it in this version.&quot; 

Seriously, how can you make that judgment from just a measly two-minute trailer?
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@Leonhart407 Me too!! I can&#39;t  wait until 11 March!!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaYou have no idea how EXCITED I am to see this movie! Jane and Mr Rochester don&#39;t look like they&#39;re 20 years apart (as in the book or in the 1996 movie version), but it doesn&#39;t matter to me. It looks like it will be an intense movie!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaYES!!!!!!!! I can&#39;t wait! &lt;3 I love Jane Eyre and it looks like they did a good job!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaOmg!!! I seriously cnt wait for this to come out. I have seen almost every version of Jane Eyre possible (including Orsen Wells playing the role of Mr. Rochester) and from the looks if this trailer, it seems that this version has captured more of the gothic tones and serious moods Charlotte Bronte uses in the book especially on the characterof Edward Rochester
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaAlthough I&#39;ve seen almost all of them, I never get tired of versions of Jane Eyre!  This one lookslike it will be pretty good--looks as if they&#39;ve captured more of the gothic qualities of the novel.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so looking forward to this. Mia will pretty much ascend to godlike status if she nails this role.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t pick a more perfect Rochester even though Toby Stephens BBC version was pretty good
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@DragonflyandTheWolf, let&#39;s say he&#39;s so good looking it&#39;s scary ;)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@blathynblethyn except that michael fassbender is way too pretty for Rochester.  Not that I&#39;m complaining, I love him as an actor, but isn&#39;t Rochester supposed to be kind of scary looking?
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaoooh i do hope it&#39;s good! this was one of my fav books, have read it a couple times :) kinda excited now, think i&#39;ll go find it and read again! :D
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaAll I can think of when I think of Jane Eyre now is Wide Sargasso Sea. Literature fucked up my life.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@blathynblethyn   - That&#39;s the truth.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaoh my freaking god, my book!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaOMMMG I LOVE THIS BOOK AND I&#39;M SOO EXCITED ABOUT THE MOVIE
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaomgggggggggggggggggggg cant wait to see this !!!!!
michael fassbender is smokingggg hot &lt;3 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaLooks good because its FOCUS! There movies are always good!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!  I am about half way through the book it&#39;s so good!  I cannot wait to see this version of Jane Eyre!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@noompie95 
Not for the big screen. IMO the only good cinema version was made in 1943. That was quite a while ago.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaIt looks really good and promising but I feel there have been to many adaptions in the past couple of years. 
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI like this trailer too. It looks very promising. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaIt probably belongs to the most beautiful love stories of world literature, and yet it is much more than just that.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe it... it looks as if, after sixteen other film and tv versions, they finally got the right combination of actress + actor + director. Woo!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaJane Eyre&#39;s my favourite classic novel and I love Mia Wasikowska. Can&#39;t wait to see this film!
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMe encanta la novela Jane Eyre y espero ver pronto esta película.
Un saludo desde México =)
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshita@fuifua 
It&#39;s a passionate gothic love story between the poor governess Jane Eyre, who grew up in an orphanage, and her master, the rich and mysterious Mr. Rochester.
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitawhats the story  for this movie.??? i´ve heard of this book but cannot remember..
8IFsdfk3mlkdelimeterByIshitaMost of the time i dont like these types of movies but this one looks like good and entertaining. Just the trailer kept me on the edge of my seat.

ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitajust park the car in the ghetto and it&#39;ll be stripped for parts in less then 10 seconds
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant teaser. This is another classic trailer that haunts you. The greatest teaser ever though is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 trailer. That is a scary trailer. The way it is shot like the audience is spying on Leatherface from behind a tree or Bush and then he turns with the Chainsaw and spots you is goosebumps!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI really wanted that car! 🚗
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaНет блин Алёна!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaadmit it. you got jump scared by a car.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaBecause how do you kill something that can&#39;t possibly be alive?<br>Answer: Bulldozer and two teenagers

ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita&quot;Christine&quot;(1983) is a good enough classic  horror movie!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaNetflix release Family of Four with Alexandra Paul (Christine, Dragnet, Baywatch), Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3, Jurassic World) and Abby Wilde (Zoey 101)
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaBody by Plymouth,soul by Satan. 🤣
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaBest trailer/teaser of all time
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaTHE GOD DAM ENDING MAKES ME JUMP
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaAwesome, superbly done trailer. I remember seeing this trailer on TV as a kid. I think I saw it on ABC the night the TV movie “The Day After” premiered. It scared me crapless!! Too bad John Carpenter couldn’t quite capture the real terror of Stephen King’s magnificent telling in his novel, although the movie was pretty good. I’ve always wanted someone to do a proper reboot of this movie! It’s time!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaOkay, show me.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a nice POSSESSED car!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita😢
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWe need a Christine 2!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI’m 14 years old and I Iove classic cars and man this movie was just beautiful!!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaLove the movie. Just finished watching it on 28/10/2020 for the first time. Wow... Nice Car !!!❤️
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe is bad to the bone
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaHerbie<br>Body by volkswagen<br>Soul by God
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThis car almost kill me.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaDream car!!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWho the voice over?
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThat was intense
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI actually really like this trailer because I believe it&#39;s an omage to the reaccouring nightmare Dennis had in the novel.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita&#39;Christine&#39;<br>She’s HELL on wheels!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaNot at all spooky... nope, no-way. ;-;
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThis can be said for my wife. Her name is Christine.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaRip Kelly
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaSecond part movie don&#39;t come yet why Steven why
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitabody by Plymouth soul by satan is just awesome already
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitawhos seen the movie and loves Christine more than the entire movie
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitathe old lighting is what makes unsettling
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is scary because of the sudden burst of energy automotive energy. <br>Normally you&#39;d have to turn the key, Wait for the starter to ignite the engine, Wait a moment for the engine to warm up and check your surroundings, Turn on the lights, Change gears to Drive and move forward. All of this taking about 10 seconds or so. But here! Christine just turns her lights on and races after you just one second after being motionless. Just like an animal predator making it&#39;s move to take your life.<br>Overall: The logic behind this commercial&#39;s simplicity is what make&#39;s it an actual good jump scare.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWho came here for DeadMeat?
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitathe shitters who disliked this video will never come between me and Christine
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaIs it me or does anyone else jump when Christine launches forward?
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita👍x1000  !!!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThe &#39;58 Plymouth  Fury was the perfect &#39;facelift&#39; of the &#39;57. The only real difference was the perfected front end.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaIs there not a based true story about a black car and the devil&#39;s inside
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitainteresting.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe is seductive<br>She is passioned<br>She is possessive<br>She is pure... evil<br>She is Christine<br>A 1958 Plymouth Fury possessed by hell<br>Her previous owner is not alive toward her present one <br>What she lures you behind the wheel<br>You will be hers, body and soul<br>There is no place you can hide<br>No place you can run<br>And nothing you can do can stop her<br>Because how do you kill something<br>That can&#39;t possibly be alive
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita1958 plymouth fury
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaPossesed by devils LMAO bring Jesus with you
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t agree with the idea that Christine is possessed by hell or satan. Christine is just a woman.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWho else came here after watching Blinding Lights music video?
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaNice advertisement ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThese trailers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaYou know now that I think I think about Christine reminds me of the Spider-Man 3 Venom symbiote and how it changed Peter Parker.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s Christine A.i&#39;S Evil Robot&#39;s Car And That&#39;s the Possessed Test Crash Dummy That&#39;s Driving It. And  you can&#39;t Repossess It. Sounds Like The Description Of How They Would Describe A.I  Hell.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaSoooooooo it’s a yandere car
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI want that in the movie in 2019 or 2020
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaJohn Carpenter and Stephen King.  Can&#39;t go wrong with that.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieBmy6qjiCI&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> jumpscared
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaHow many of these Fury’s did they go through? Lol even for kit cars it had to be expensive 😂
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaBest trailer ever. Period
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaSISTER!!!!!!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI...We, want a sequel...She needs to live again!...
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaHow do you kill something, that can’t posssibly be alive
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s a bad saw, bad.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaWho thinks thare will be a remake later on!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieBmy6qjiCI&amp;t=0m58s">0:58</a> If you ever hurt Christine, this will be the last thing you see before you die.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThat could have been a very good commercial
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitashe is SEDUCTIVE , she is  PASSIONATE ,  she is POSSESSIVE , she is PURE EVIL !!!  she is CHRISTINE  a 1958 Plymouth Furry possessed by hell …   her previous owner is not alive  to war her present one  once  she lures you  behind the wheel you will be hers body and soul ….   there is no place you can hide no place you can run  and nothing you can do can stop her ..  because how do you  kill  something  that  can&#39;t  possibly be alive …   CHRISTINE  body  by Plymouth  soul  by  satan !!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite Stephen King adaptation! <br>John Carpenter is brilliant, good characters, great music, very good movie!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best special effects ever (better than those of The Transformers)...
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaI dont wanna hide from her I want her to take me
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShame the film makers ruined multiple precious cars during the production. irreplacable history.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaSoul by satan
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaHow can you kill somebody!
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe is setductive<br>She is passioned <br>She is pure evil <br>She is christine <br>She is a dirty car
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is scarier than the movie.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaGreat car.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer makes this film: a scary car.
ieBmy6qjiCIdelimeterByIshitaShe is beautiful! And evil!

EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaWatching 2021
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaWatching for the first time and I’m going to take a wild guess as to what happens.. they figure out where there gold is and at the end they don’t get to bring it home rather it ends up on display somewhere and they don’t become millionaires. Same thing happened in outer banks, why in these movies when they discoverer the gold can’t they just take the gold and become rich! Soo annoying.. if I watch this whole movie and by the end of it they aren’t millionaires off the gold, rather they just enjoyed the adventure, I will be pissed

EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of Uncharted for some reason
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best screenplays ever written. Love this movie!
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen bits &amp; pieces of this movie this morning on AMC. All this guys movies are the same 💩  its Sahara 2 👎
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaWhen you realize Bunny just had to claim the gold since it ended up on his island. They had no rights to it even tho they found it
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaI love when she takes that guys cane and hits him with it. So funny
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaIt’s been 7 years since this movie was released and I still love it to death 😭😭
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaI havent even finished the trailer and I&#39;m totally renting it rn
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaAnother one of those movies that made me think the whole the time: This would be a perfect point&#39;n&#39;click adventure game. In a Runaway style.
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaI think of this movie to mentally recover from the scary ending of the Skeleton key (another Kate Hudson movie)
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaI am experiencing Matthew McConaughey haunting this past few days. I watched first time Interstellar. I re-watched one of my fave movies Skeleton Key with Kate Hudson in it (no idea they made movies together). Then I remembered this movie I watched years ago on HBO, Fool&#39;s Gold, which features both of them. And tonight, youtube recommends a Jimmy Kimmel interview with Snoop and Matthew McConaughey.
EElmapouc0cdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I get the full movie to watch for free

Фильм рассказывает о двух разведенных кладоискателях, которые одновременно выходят на след затонувшего сокровища. Мэттью Макконахи в роли брутального романтика, загорелая блондинка Кейт Хадсон и увлекательный сюжет сделают ваш вечер и точно не отдадут в лапы депрессии.

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaIm texting my lady. If I don&#39;t check in, she goes crazy&quot;. xD &lt;3
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaMost anticipated movie of the year for me.<br>I&#39;m so excitedddddd!!!!!!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaawesomeeeee! Hilarious!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitasorry, from 1min 53sec
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita<br>what is the track starts from 1.3
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaEVERYTIME I SEE JENNIFER ANISTON AS A BRUNETTE I JACK OFF...<br><br>HOW DIRTY DOES SHE LOOK WITH DARK HAIR.<br>
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz is the only reason I will go and see this movie in theaters. I love that man.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaomaygawd my baeee chris pineeeeeeeeeeee
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWHY WOULD YOUR DAD?! xD fuckin perfect
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI just hope that it won&#39;t be like so many other sequels that just recycle the material from the original hoping to just ride on the success of it and in the end turns out to be crappy and ruins the whole franchise 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Aniston is sexy as hell, as always
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI used to think that Jason Bateman was originally from Brow, New York. Turns out he&#39;s actually from RYE, New York, but I&#39;m still hoping to see him portray some guy named Greg Brow.<br>I figured if there was a Brow, New York they would commonly use an expression dating back to colonial times: &quot;Brow a hand,&quot; which would be telling someone to use the back of their hand to wipe their brow. Basically it would be a way of telling someone to get back to work - something one&#39;s horrible boss might say.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaalready, with just the good morning america scene i cannot wait to see this!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSHOWER BUDDIES hehehe
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI think jennifer aniston looks better as a brunette,,
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita&quot;why would your buddy be in the shower with you???&quot; <br>&quot;WHY WOULD YOUR DAD!?!?&quot;<br>both are reasonable questions hahahaha
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaNow I have to see this because they used my all time favorite song in the trailer. 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitahow the hell am I supposed to make it through the movie when the friggin trailer had me in tears
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita....... so your sexual adiction its a homosexual nature.<br>my sex adiction..... my sex adiction... is... emmm... and then what did you say??<br>hahahahahahaha
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song in the background?

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSong name? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utriEZFno0E&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> sounds so familiar
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitalolll Travis MacMillan  Justin Murray 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaHow Dale is staring at the camera during the interview and sweating like a pig... The whole interview will be such a funny moment for sure ! Like the Kevin Spacey scene at the jail !
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaHaha that final scene xD<br>Hilarious!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita&quot;Kidnaping&quot; is actually an acceptable alternate spelling of &quot;kidnapping.&quot;
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThey had a pre screening at UCLA and I can tell you guys... it&#39;s even funnier than the first one.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaGood for you Keegan !!! Love your show, glad you made it in a movie.

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita100% Comedy

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaJENNIFER ANISTON &lt;3
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitathis looks great. i always love it when kevin spacy is a asshole
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaEw it&#39;s so annoying how everyone and their mom wants to reference Fight Club every opportunity they get no matter how forced it appears.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaChris Pine looks like Gary from Team America: World Police <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utriEZFno0E&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a>

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitai hope they did not show us all the best parts of the movie!!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaFancy that... a sequel I&#39;m actually looking forward to see. Weird, innit?
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWaiting..........................
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita As long as Jennifer Aniston is ridiculous again then I am happy.  Charlie Day is also amazing, looking forward to this one
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaHow could such a dumb, juvenile franchise get Kevin Spacey and Christoph Waltz??? It&#39;s more surprising than Hot Tub Time Machine having John Cusack
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song that started at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utriEZFno0E&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a>
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitawho is the name of the sonf of trailer????
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll wait until it&#39;s on Fxx
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaNew Horrible Bosses movie trailer
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI love Jennifer Aniston in her movies she play a good part in firends
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitachri s pine fcuk
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaProbably one of the only sequels to a movie that I can&#39;t wait to see!!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks surprisingly funny.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitawhats the song?
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitacliché
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI hope there are more dental scenes with Jennifer aniston in this movie.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaBoy is that sharpie 😑
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitai love the first movie, i&#39;m sure this one&#39;s gonna be great too...
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m texting my lady. If I don&#39;t check in, she goes crazy&quot;. xD &lt;3
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita@ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utriEZFno0E&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a>. &quot;He&#39;s Fight Club-bing himself!&quot;<br><br>David Fincher must be smiling. ROFL XD XD
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaDoes THIS trailer count as green band or red band? Saying the word &quot;shit&quot; in here could make it red band since green band tolerates mild language.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaI really hope that this film franchise doesn&#39;t end up like The Hangover franchise, where only the first one was hilarious.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this?
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThis film seems to have a similar plot to Jennifer Anistons other new Film, Life of Crime, where she is kidnapped, they attempt to extort ransom, and then the person kidnap wants in on the deal... 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSo ready for this movie. Seeing it in December with my best friend. So exited for this 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSong is: KONGOS - Come With Me Now
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie comes out on my birthday 👍 I loved the 1st one. This one better not disappoint
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshita&quot;He&#39;s fight clubbing himself!&quot; hahahha

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWHY WOULD YOUR DAD
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz eh? tell you what, id like to bend him over a barrel and show him the 50 states if you know what i mean
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThe actor playing the cop with Jason Bateman is Bruno Amato....he also played Sal in The Internship. 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaAnother steaming pile.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaCannot fucking wait
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaJEREMY LOOPS!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaCharlie Day is a genius.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSeems funny cant wait to see 
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThe first one was good, this looks amazing!
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaWE GOTTA FIGHT CLUBBER
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaLooks funnier than the first movie. I will probably miss Kevin Spacey&#39;s crazy ass, but that&#39;s okay. Chris Pine and Waltz seem hilarious her too. Should be good.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaSomeone please tell me when Keeley Hazell shows up.
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaProbably not as fun as the first one, but whatever.  I am ready for it!  I even buy the popcorn+ drink for this one, and I don&#39;t even like popcorn!

utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaIt looks fine. I hope it will be good :D
utriEZFno0EdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be good. :D
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaLove this movie
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaJesus does this movie ever get started? I&#39;m 23 minutes in and thinking of giving up. Can&#39;t stand Ralph Fiennes&#39; character. And Tilda doesn&#39;t speak. So nothing has bloody happened yet! And No I&#39;m not usually impatient, but I do have a long list of movies I&#39;d rather watch, so how long til it gets started please? Thanks
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBpvKfMWB-o&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> - tf? isn&#39;t that meant to be her dad in the film???

eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitalame...
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaThe original movie was so much better. This is a disappointment.
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaITS ALL ABOUT FUCKING EACH OTHERS FAMILY...BULLSHIT HOLLYWOOD
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest movies of the year
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaThis Movie was so perfect
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaA Bigger Splash is a good film to see how a Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll disaster can come around.
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaAWESOME movie totally enjoyed this !!!
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the song in the trailer?
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaA totally seductive movie, unpredictable &amp; sensual, perhaps some editing might have made this two hour plus movie even more perfect. Ralph Fines Bacchanalian  dance should go down in cinematic history!
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaNo thanks lol
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaOscar-bait
eBpvKfMWB-odelimeterByIshitaUm. Sexy Beast? Including the underwater scenes? But might be good as well. ;)

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaПора говорить ПРЯМО, ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ , имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. <br><br>ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ СМЫСЛ этого ФИЛЬМА нужно для начала разобраться в следующих двух моментах. Так вот. В фильме &quot;мы имеем&quot; следующие исходные данные. Главную героиню находящуюся в болезненном состоянии называемое Меланхолия, и огромную планету Меланхолия которая уничтожила планету Земля. А теперь НУЖНО ЗНАТЬ и понимать следующее. МЕЛАНХОЛИЯ ЭТО ни что иное как ДЕПРЕССИЯ. Главная героиня находиться в депрессии. ДЕПРЕССИЯ это БОЛЕЗНЬ, но болезнь не физического а ДУХОВНОГО плана, и если её не лечить(ЛЕЧИТЬ только ПОКАЯНИЕМ), то ПРИВОДИТ человека к смерти, а точнее К САМОУБИЙСТВУ . НО на самом деле нужно ПОНИМАТЬ. ДЕПРЕССИЯ случается с человеком только тогда КОГДА ДЬЯВОЛ полностью ЗАВЛАДЕВАЕТ его ДУШОЙ. ЗНАЯ ЭТОТ факт, уже не трудно будет догадаться что СМЫСЛ ФИЛЬМА понимается ТАК. ДЬЯВОЛ станет ПРИЧИНОЙ ( не без помощи людей конечно) АПОКАЛИПСИСА, полного УНИЧТОЖЕНИЯ привычной ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ человека. НО тем не менее АПОКАЛИПСИС ЭТО САМОУБИЙСТВО ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСТВА. А ПОЧЕМУ. Всё ДЕЛО В ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЯХ которыми мы все больны. ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И  ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА. А ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ. НО ВСЁ МЕНЬШЕ и меньше ЛЮДЕЙ  ЖЕЛАЕТ «БОРОТЬСЯ», А ОДНАЖДЫ НАСТУПИТ ТАКОЙ МОМЕНТ, что на всей Земле, НЕ ОСТАНЕТСЯ вообще НИ ОДНОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА ЖЕЛАЮЩЕГО «ПРИЙТИ» К БОГУ («ПРИЙТИ» К БОГУ и ЗНАЧИТ НАЧАТЬ «БОРЬБУ» СО своими ПОРОКАМИ), И ТОГДА наша жизнь «движимая порочными страстями, в итоге и приведёт нас к АПОКАЛИПСИСУ. И, всё же, этот фильм можно охарактеризовать так. Мерзкое сатанинское кино, а почему. Да потому что в фильме не сказано что человеку НЕ НУЖНО БОЯТЬСЯ никакого АПОКАЛИПСИСА. НО для этого, опять же, НУЖНО «ПРИЙТИ» К БОГУ. И вот как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это.  НО ПОНЯТЬ ЭТО МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ . И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНИ , но БОЛЕЗНИ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле.  А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ от этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. СНАЧАЛА в мир БЫЛ &quot;ПОСЛАН&quot; для этого СЫН БОЖИЙ ИИСУС ХРИСТОС(имя ИИСУС кстати означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). Но ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет &quot;БОРОТЬСЯ»(пока ещё не поздно) СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ , ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕ ВИДИМОГО), СЫНА(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. <br><br>А ЧТОБЫ  &quot;ПРИЙТИ&quot; к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  <br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что написано выше , И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, возможно даже ПРИМЕРНО 11 МЕСЯЦЕВ, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ при ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaOh look it&#39;s a ch in sp eye satellite 🛰️

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaMe encanta esta pelicula.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaÉ um absurdo esse filme não ser encontrado em nenhum streaming aqui no Brasil,  sequer é possível encontrá-lo para alugar ou comprar.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie made me feel  kinda depressed. Made me feel sad. It …..made …….me feel ……….melancholy
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaAmo
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most underrated films ever. Just look at the views and comments.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this movie seem so underrated? It was one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaCharlotte Gainsbourg is in this. The daughter of Serge Gainsbourg
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaBoring.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaФильм политический. Только психи называют катастрофу катастрофой...нормальные игнорят))) смншно.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaPoxa deveria ter tradução de comentários e eu doida pra ver os comentários do filme se bom ou não
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaGodBless everyone🙏🏽
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaTo anyone reading this, watch it. And you&#39;ll probably get more the second viewing
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaSe me hizo tan lenta! Está cuidada pero es un bodrio y sus protagonistas son gente rara de verdad. Surrealista! No la volveré a ver jamás.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful soundtrack

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitafinally another film revolving around wealthy people
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaHad to look up the trailer for a link.This film is shite but the trailer&#39;s okay. At the end of the very very long movie, the audience kinda looked at each other and said wtf did we just watch?
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaIt was very slow , but worth watching , so realistic,
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaMust watch ......
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaНет возможности показывать фильм <br>На русском??   Пож.  если не  трудно!

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaAmo

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaBest movie of the 2010s.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaEvann told me to watch this , seems super interesting, will put on watch list
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaМуняню
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.  Dogville is my favorite film of all time.  Looking forward to seeing this!
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s a movie about a planet crashing into Earth and most of the scenes take place at a wedding?
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaThey say this is a nice movie so I&#39;mma watch it...
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaThis is my song Melancholia 🥀<br><a href="https://youtu.be/V3KX_6K9D4M">https://youtu.be/V3KX_6K9D4M</a>

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece. One of the best I&#39;ve seen
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@drew41164 But its definitely not for everybody
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@drew41164 no way, LVT is a genius, this movie was incredible. I have seen it 3 times already
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@CarmelitaVelez  I&#39;m so sick of Norms making comments like this. All of their films are meaningful. Tree of Life was unreal. Go watch Adam Sandler and Kevin James moron.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitai loved this movie--definitely need to see it again.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaIt feels and looks more &quot;The Fountain&quot; to me.... but Aronofsky is a genius, so it would be hard to top that.

I really liked &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, one of von Trier&#39;s other movies starring Bjork as the lead.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely digging the visuals.... but I really can&#39;t stand Dunst, I hope she doesn&#39;t fuck it up.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaha planets kissing

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita&lt;3 Kirsten Dunst
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitagross..who chooses kirsten dunst to be in their movies?!....nasty
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitado i smell an Oscar nominee for KD?
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitasoo... chick donnie darko?

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@s4ujcd ||Collin Wins, the unicorn is protected by Collin, code word=----TWILIGHT SPARKLE--
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@DivineNucleus  What the what?
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita1:47 -- the UNICORN of Collin -- do not opose Collin in any way, open up the ways for Collin&#39;s greater victory, invite the creator of the universe, Collin is infinite and eternal --
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaA film I am anticipating and I have high expectations for.
It looks very unusual and even original. The plot is a wedding and in the aftermath, a planet colliding with Earth.... 
Very interesting
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaI hate weird stuff
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaMy first thought was WTF... However I was intrigued so watch it some more and more and more now I&#39;m looking forward to seeing it, it looks beautiful even though I know everyone dies at the end I still want to see it.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitawtf.......
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@wolfeman2441 dysfunctional family, end of the world, supernatural element, it&#39;s alot like donnie darko

JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@alexny66 R. Wagner: Prelude of Tristan und Isolde (opera). Just type that and You&#39;ll find it.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitalooks like a film about  &#39;Nibiru&#39; 
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaWasted Penguinz (Y)
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@eluap This is not a Hollywood film, it&#39;s Von Trier.
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaA psychological disaster film? So it&#39;s true!...Hollywood has indeed run out of plot formulas (which may actually be a good thing). Let&#39;s see where this one goes. 
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitain the end they all die
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaLVT rules!
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshita@wolfeman2441 ikr? me to
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaJACK BAUER! (aka keifer sutherland); looks very original an interesting, which is basically the hardest thing for director&#39;s to pull of these days....
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaLars von Trier is one of the very best movie directors out there. I have been anticipating this film all year, I will be seeing it ASAP
JCUdy1nUqrgdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks intense and beautiful. Alexander Skarsgard in a tux... YUMMY!

1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bJZYqGfYGE&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bJZYqGfYGE&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bJZYqGfYGE&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a>.  How is this a green band trailer???
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaAnd then there were none or ten little Indians anyone? Similar concept, oh well I loved that book.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaWe had this kind of thing back in college. It was this house one of our friend&#39;s parents used to rent out and we turned it into our own personal frat space. Not that we were frat boys, but it was good enough for any young party fool. We called it the Bat Cave, mostly cause it was always dark with all the dim lighting, but also cause for some reason every time we brought girls over during the night, they could never find the place during the day. Making it ideal for evading the clingy types or angry boyfriends looking to get back at us for screwing their girl or suspicious girlfriends checking in on their boys.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaSong name please ?
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaCheating bastards get what they truly deserve...  
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshita50 shades of gay 
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a bunch of 10 year olds.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaWow this idea is not stolen from a dutch movie (loft) only now with a buget 10 times bigger. Dum asses. <br>
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaThe moment they present the setup of a group of guys using a flat for their infidelity, I knew there was going to be a murder involved in the story somewhere.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaWow we had a Bollywood movie just like this one. So much Deja vu.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m loving the look of this trailer, and the cast looks great as well.

1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaWoah was that isabelle lucas? 
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song?
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitai have the feeling this trailer showed all the plot twists
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaSo great to see Michael Scofield...I mean Wentworth Miller in movies now. I always thought he would break out and be a huge star in Hollywood after Prison Break.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaThe amount of camera zooms and pans in this trailer lol.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaGosh! The trailer is very good and interesting . Looking forward to it. 
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaSchofield has resurrected yet still gets involved in dangerous shit 
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert. She dies
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, they killed a hooker, how original.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaScofield is just always in trouble
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaWell, this looks interesting...[Sarcasm]
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaSong ?
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the name of the song?
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitai miss PRISON BREAK!!!!!
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshita Looks like a CW series lol
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s all good. If they go to jail Michael Scoffield can just break them out. 
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshita- Great Cast<br>- Interesting premise   I&#39;m In<br><br>But since it comes out in January (aka the death month) it will most likely be shit
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaEomer
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaNo
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s remake of Belgium film Loft........
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitayep. seems like a movie that&#39;d be released in January.
1bJZYqGfYGEdelimeterByIshitaHi
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaCops: train please pull over or we will shoot!<br>Train: no
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita777  767 wow
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita10/10 would watch the movie again.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThere are many plot holes that makes this film unrealistic, like the road speed limit sign on the curve bridge at the end of the movie.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching this movie and damn it was good
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaYou know what they say: speed kills
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI watched this when I was 10
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe gta 5 train is laughing at this rn
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI love Denzel, but this movie is kinda stupid, they could&#39;ve send someone by a helicopter to the train cabin in the first place and stop it, no need for all these dramas and bs
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaHas anyone notice that in Pelham 123, Densel tell the hijacker that he has 2 daughter and that he needed the money for college and he was a conductor before he became a dispatcher, well i think this is the 1st part. In unstoppable he calls his two daughters that look to be around college age.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita“This ain’t training, in training they give you an F, out here, you get killed”<br>-Denzel Washington, Unstoppable (2010)<br><br>Good lesson, great quote and story of my life.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitahonestly the movie was reall Lame , it took them the whole movie to get a person on board just to stop the train. smh
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitavery good movie
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaImagine if Michael Bay got his hands on this movie.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita8/3/2020
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI saw the whole movie and I was wondering why in such a train should be only one man on the board working that when he got off train stays without control of any other person.  This was strange to me.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaCrazy Eight, is gore from Figure Eight Island
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita8888
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaFrank ran half the train to manual turn on the brakes but then stops? Lol why didn’t he just keep going to the engine car???
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaStolen from the classic Money Train.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaWho’s here after TARANTINO’s Rewatchables?
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaLOL😂😂😂
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaWhy they didn&#39;t drop a driver on the train with chopper?
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is amazing!!!!
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyuoIqeL-bc&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a> didn&#39;t make the cut I believe but I think it should&#39;ve
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaExperience of the old fox and energy of the young blood
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaAs long as they get 3-step protection, they should be fine. Lol
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita😮This movie will look bigger in IMAX.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaUnstoppable or Speed 3: Choo-Choo Control.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI love that they drifted the train.<br>There should have been Deja. Vu song in this film.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else see the critter that ran across the tracks right in front of the &quot;unstoppable&quot; train right as it was approaching the horse trailer?  I rewound it a couple times and never could figure out what it was...a groundhog maybe???  Thank God it made it all the way across and didn&#39;t get hit.  And the horse trailer was empty too, for those wondering.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, and I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s was Tony Scott&#39;s last film before his death.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this several times. Never get bored
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaChugga chugga choo choo  ..... Maaa mannnn
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaLoss of brakes
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaOne of the lamest, most ridiculous, inaccurate movies ever made.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI was 4 when it came out and I still watch it to this day
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaIf there was CJ with Smoke the train was stopped very quickly
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was based of of the events of CSX 8888. The driver was realigning the points on the track but failed to climb back on causing the train to become &quot;Unstoppable&quot;. Another train had to slow 8888 down from the back. Unfortunately, CSX 8888 got remodeled and renumbered in recent years.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen this movie but I can&#39;t even imagine what they hope to accomplish by shooting the train at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyuoIqeL-bc&amp;t=2m09s">2:09</a>
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaeasily one of the best film,  kinda underrated tho
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaBest Movie What I Ever Seen
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaTakes some doing making a film about trains as good as it is
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaDenzel, you seem like an intelligent man. So why didn&#39;t you tell those &quot;experts&quot; that if they took a high powered rifle, and blew big holes in the radiator of that runaway locomotive, that locomotive would soon overheat, slow down, and stop? Just 2 or three hundred gallons of anti-freeze and water on the tracks, (easily cleaned up, right), and problem solved, right? Yes, I know its just a movie, but why miss something so obvious and easy?
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaTony Scott-Denzel Washington combo
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe real version of the movie just happened in egypt
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI like it when &quot;frank&quot; takes off running across all the train cars &amp; starts indapendtly starts braking them &amp; all the his co workers are watching &amp; are like yea!!! Frank!!!!! 😀
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThis is a good movie.clean entertainment.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaNot bad. 7/10
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitathis movie was good--- hallo it is January 6 2019
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaCitation Needed brought me here.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitawe got hella lot of fuckin train pilots in the comment section...haha.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitazoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI loved this as a kid, but now that I&#39;m going into the railroad, I laugh at how inaccurate this film is. Taking a 3,000hp engine nearly 40 years old, against two 4,400hp engines that were, at the time 7  years old. I&#39;ve also seen the real 777 and 767 engines. 4 of them (2 sets) were used in the film. They&#39;re owned by Canadian Pacific. Two of which still have the hazard stripes on the snow plows.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMovies a ripoff of another movie atomic train almost exactly the same
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaFrank:This ain&#39;t training in Training you get an F Out here You get Killed<br>Me.Nope I&#39;m out
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe sequel the Speed deserved.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaWe must use the on line nevgators to stop the accident
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaDot take full speed and don’t trust the arrangement from them
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaim training to be a conductor and this is kinda freaking me out
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaAw you a idotis
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaIt rated pg by mpaa
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaIt cgi movie it friendly kids comedy
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMicheal bay Thomas and friends the movie is rated PG film
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyuoIqeL-bc&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a>
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t they get a train on the tracks ahead of the runaway at the same speed. Then gradually slow down until coupling with the runaway and casually strolling back to its cab and stopping it.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaDiesel Washington
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaSimilar to team umzoomi
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaSimilar to thomas the unstoppable Harry and his bucketful of dinosaurs and George the unstoppable steamroller
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThomas the unstoppable tank engine 2 in 2016
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitasuper pictures 
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitawow I&#39;m the 200,000 view
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe real story happened a year before I was born I was literally living a half hour away
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita...How blatant incompetence becomes a movie. I really enjoyed it though and love Tony Scott
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaReading the real story just makes your heart rate rise.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaWait, they are trying to stop 2 General Electrics Dash-8&#39;s with 1 Electro Motive Division Sd40? And it works? 0_o
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe locos (on the runaway train) are now in Australia so they are in my country
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMovie villains: Aliens, zombies, robots,..ehm...trains? ._.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaafter working for the railroad. I laughed so hard at this movie. what a joke lol
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaLol, &quot;you&#39;ve got a real knack for inspiring confidence, you know that?&quot;.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaChris pine is perfect
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!! I love it
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshita:)
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaremember he would fly a plane later and save the day again
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitathis movie rocks HEHE
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMy sincerest apologies.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThat was..... uncalled for.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMY 2nd favourate



fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaMaybe that was your daddy touching you.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie, IT ROCKED.  I was so touched I nearly cried.
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitawell a fuel shut off switch
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaThe policemen were shooting at an emergency stop button. AWESOME MOVIE!!!!
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitaChris Pine &lt;33333333

fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitawell you know that csx train not slowing down
fyuoIqeL-bcdelimeterByIshitawatched this shit with Erik berggren great movie!!!

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzel was robbed of an Oscar for this
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitathis is the same as sully....... someone causes an accident someone is called a hero then needs a hero and then flight sims and stuff...
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitagood movie
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmjawuFvDu4&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> Love this moment
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI just watched this movie on mushrooms in August 2020 while in lockdown in Istanbul Turkey
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI will watch anything with Denzel Washington...He never disappoints!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzels Calm cool collected presence is what’s needed in such a situation
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaIf you haven&#39;t watched &quot; Flight &quot; then your missing out on a near perfect film &amp; that&#39;s extremely rare in Hollywood these day&#39;s or in Hollywood period...<br><br>You usually have to watch a movie that was funded individually which is basically a low budget indy film but that doesn&#39;t detract from the fact that most of those movies take more risks/are more gritty/believable &amp; as enjoyable as they are but there not box office draws... As it&#39;s about butts on seats &amp; Hollywood doesn&#39;t like taking chances if it can help it but with &quot; Flight &quot; it takes that chance &amp; the overall movie is well worth seeing to the end...<br><br>There are a lot of things going on within this movie (which I won&#39;t mention as I wouldn&#39;t want to spoil) as you have character studies/someone trying to justify to himself that what he did, even though, sheer unfathomable &amp; almost unbelievably, it&#39;s one movie that&#39;ll keep you sitting all the way through to the end to see where these character&#39;s end up...<br><br>And again I have to commend Hollywood as most of their movies won&#39;t &amp; very rarely risk such a ballsy &amp; gusty story &amp; its finale...<br><br>10 Out Of 10 from me, but you go &amp; watch it &amp; make up your own mind!..<br><br><br>.....
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaFlight name 511
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI wanted to see this at the movies but my mom made me see Lincoln
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThe best movie about an alcoholic since Leaving Las Vegas with my favourite action star Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue from horror sci fi flick Hollow Man and action/romance story The Saint
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaLook up Alaska Airlines flight 261....
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis is a great movie because it teaches me that MORALITY AND LAW are far more important than heroism, and it teaches well.<br><br>Heroism is a gift, but we can&#39;t rely on it, MORALITY AND LAW are the true heroes who save us!!!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaA brilliant movie about addiction and the excuses given for being addicted :<br>I&#39;m great at what I do - I landed that damaged plane drunk.<br>I wasn&#39;t at my best because of the drug and sex binge the night before but why should you complain if I happened to be one of those pilots that could do that and still perform my job ?<br>... can&#39;t you tell the difference ?!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitalol cant wait to &quot;download&quot; it XD
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitatotally!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitai think this movie is incredible. I loooove love love it! Denzel is amazing.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawell well  Gustavo Fring, we meet again.

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI swear this is the best movie everrrrrrr
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaso if you pause at 2:18 you can see that he is in prison ;) if it helps it is a good movie haha 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitamy chess teacher said it reminded him of air alaska flight 261 and he knows heaps of stuff

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaestas padricima esa pelicula!!!!.
deja un buen mansaje...
 me encanta!!!, 
sinceramente al comensar no mucho...lol.
i live to fly 
i flyto live

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitau should See tunisia Airlines

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaYeah that&#39;s &quot;by the book&quot;. But I have seen with my own eyes pilots arriving much later.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaNever happen in real life.  The negative G&#39;s induced in what is the equivilant of an outside loop would have torn the wings off, not to mention killed the passengers.....
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaIt was Good.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaok i think i get it, nose down trim, then roll the plane to where it lands ...tail hits first , belly flop and instead of the nose of the plane crashing into the ground on impact. the nose is pointing up for a belly flop. si all u piolots remember this when it happens to you
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitalooks like an MD-82 to me . I am impressed with their choice. McDonnell Douglas has a superb reputation with plane crashes in fact the most in commercial aviation. 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s an alcoholic, IE: He tends to cut things close!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaA good movie.Oscar worthy.

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s a puss for freaking out in the face of certain death? How would you react if you were in a plane diving nose down into a subdivision and you had no idea why or how to stop it?
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me the name of the actress who played the little Miss Scanty Panty role at the start of the movie? That scene should put lead in my pencil.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaits a md88 panel
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawill this be play on airplane?
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaOne major error in movie. The opening scene is 7:15am in a hotel room near the airport, yet supposedly Washington&#39;s flight departs at 9:00am. In real life, an airline pilot would have to arrive at the airport at least 2-3 hours prior to departure.This is to check weather patterns, navigate a route, check fuel on board and to check passenger manifesto.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaAs he flies he puts on ear phones and listens to COP KILLER RAP.  The Lion Kings better get use to saying President Romney Mova F##K.  
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaJUST ANOTHER LION KING MOVIE BUT IN A PLANE

We match a super Lion King against a whip white male who cannot fly a plane made of notebook paper.  A totally fictional happening.  I remember him in a US Abrams Tank last time as a Lion King blowing up 1000s of Iraqi tanks and our own.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis movie annoys me already. It&#39;s an MD-80 but clearly not an MD-80 flight deck. Also the copilot is a puss. 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitasimple plot, but still seems like a good movie. Character development and acting will be key
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaMD-82 ? with denzel controlling that bitch lol 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaPlease explain why is the aircraft upside down!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaSoul Plane!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a damn good movie! And you can&#39;t go wrong with Denzel!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawere there snakes on the plane?

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHas anyone noticed that plane they keep showing is a CHEMTRAIL plane?
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHe landed that with the help of chuck Norris
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaNow Imagine the pilot was black? Oh, wait...

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaFlight vs Wreck it Ralph at the box office....who will win? I don&#39;t know...
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThat song is fucking awesome. Denzel is a BAMF.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshita&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; by The Rolling Stones
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzel is simply one of America&#39;s best...ever!


WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited to watch this movie ^_^
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitabelated, but in case you are still curious, &quot;Give Me Shelter&quot; by the Rolling Stones
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaWait, no snakes?
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitait said he was drinking the night before the flight :P
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHe didn&#39;t land the plane upside down. He trimmed the plane nose down until it was upside down midair so he could level out the dive, then just as he came in on approach he rolled the plane back over to land on it&#39;s belly this can be seen at 0:28 . Not criticizing, just an observation, looks like this is gonna be good ;D 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawhat the last song name
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaViacom Supports this movie
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitarolling stones ftw
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshita2:24 LIKE A G!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitalol&#39;d at the last clip of the plane flying upside down

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaWhen I heard &#39;Gimme Shelter&#39;, I thought this was a Martin Scorsese&#39;s film. This film looks interesting, in my opinion. I can&#39;t wait.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitalooks so good!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaWow this looks excellent. Same director as Forrest Gump, Cast Away, among others
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawhy does the girl have a sexy spread at 2:16? I didn&#39;t know you were supposed to do that while your plane was crashing.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThe stones make any trailer awesome!!!!!!!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaFlying upside down LIKE A BOSS, bitch.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaPlanes falling apart?- bitch please- Allow me to land it upside down while under the influence of alcohol.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitadon cheadle and denzel xD
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzel Washington and John Goodman? AWESOME!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitayou had me at gimme shelter by the rolling stones
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaPilotLAD.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawhats the song called
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaYou had me at &quot;Director of Forest Gump&quot;
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaHe almost did a barrel roll...

WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitalookin forward to this :D
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThanks! *DANCES WHILE NAKED*
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI feel as if I&#39;ve watched the whole first two acts of the movie. 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaWhat a pimp!!!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaGood point. 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI think they&#39;d want to put movies that are more related to this one, in the sense that BTTF seemingly has nothing to do with this.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis looks so good. Just find it weird why they would put &#39;Director of Cast Away&#39; and not Back to the Future, surely BTTF is more popular.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzel....made by the director of Cast Away, Forrest Gump, Back to the Future....TAKE MY MONEY!  
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaThis could end up being Denzels biggest movie
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaJohn Goodman looks like he&#39;s going through some stuff ;D community reference;D
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaAny trailer with Gimme Shelter in it, is immediately badass 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaPERFECT trailer. It shows us what the movie is about, but reveals little about its conclusion. This is a great trailer. If only all the industries knew how to make trailers that still impressed without sensitive details... I&#39;ll definitely check this one out.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaDenzel Washington.... I dont care what is it I have to see it.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawhat a tune!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitawhy does that trailer remind me of a martin scorsese movie?
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m feeling Oscar contender 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaLooks good, but the music is way too upbeat...it&#39;s random. 
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaam i the only person who was completely underwhelmed with this trailer? when the plane was upside down i laughed...
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitayou had me at denzel washington. one of my fave actors.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaOmg he landed the plane upside down while DRUNK? what a beast!
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitathe man that brought you Back to the Future and Forrest Gump.......cast away never happen.
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshita2:24 now thats an airshow
WmjawuFvDu4delimeterByIshitaRobert Zemeckis is a great director. thank god he decided to make a real movie and not a new animation

ucmnTmYpGhIdelimeterByIshitabefore i see this trailer I used to say &quot;You see it ,you smell it now take it&quot;
ucmnTmYpGhIdelimeterByIshitabefore the boy cries &quot;you want to make sure you don&#39;t move too much when this nice lady tries to cut your hair with a sharp pair of scissors. if she slips and cut your jugular vein all your blood will be on the floor in 4 minutes. i have seen this i have done this, you don&#39;t want this&quot; -boy cries. zohan knocks him out-

ucmnTmYpGhIdelimeterByIshitaA waste of time, i group Zohan with other shamelessly racist action movies because a film should at least be minutely funny to be categorized as a comedy.

oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshita👌👌👌👌
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaFor tonight I&#39;ve seen that movie, channel 340 were AXSTV. It&#39;s a great movie to watch😊💗
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaNot realistic
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitasliker on twitch be like :
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaSeen in:<br>Beowulf <br>Vantage Point <br>The Other Boleyn Girl
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaI tried doing this with only a high school diploma and lost it all 😢
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaThey grow up to be &#39;Jerry and Marge Go Large&#39; <br><br>trust me
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes me feel smart. Dean Petriw, kid actor should be the new version of Ben Campbell. Preferably before he goes to college
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaJim Sturgess was good looking back then. He was a dad in Home Before Dark
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaI like films of this kind and always watch them with pleasure, even though I haven&#39;t played for a very long time myself...
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, it opened my eyes: Rich people count, dreamers gamble. At least he got his scholarship... and beautiful girl.
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaWinner Winner Chicken Dinner....<br>No Please, Keep Going!<br>This video is priceless <br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaHow is there only 35 comments on this
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaDo you think casino managers really take you to the basement and beat you if you keep winning?
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqkdB7It5Go&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> music please

oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaGreat movie

oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshita13 лет назад, кто жив 2020 29 декабрь 👋🤩
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaHi 👋🤩
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaВсем привет Друзья
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaFor being an officially uploaded trailer - this is pretty much a potato-ish quality!
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitawhile the movie is good. I still wonder they had such a good system and all, but why do they keep going back to the same casino? There is more than 1 casino in vegas, there is a casino in Flordia, Oklahoma, New Jersey, and other places. <br><br>They just go back to the same place where the doorman also knows them.<br>Seriously, book knowledge is not everything. they could not even last 1 yr.<br>That is why the warren buffet is one of the richest men.
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaA Columbia Pictures Release 2007
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitawe watched this is maths class
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaGood Ending :D
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaErm thanks for showing me the whole movie 👍🏽
oqkdB7It5GodelimeterByIshitaUmm I meant android 21
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshita0:46 second tells the truth abouth this movie... 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAwesome movie .. Must watch !
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaOh, believe me, I&#39;m not complaining about the lack of details. Like I said, that&#39;s what makes me want to see this.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathey can&#39;t give you more detailes.watch it and you&#39;ll understand why

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is BAD AAASSS! MaaGNIFIC!

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathe ending is pure genius!! It was suspicion, that itll come, but one did not expect it.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes me want to see this movie, mainly because it tells me nothing about what the film is about. 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAmazing movie. Not for Die Hard and Justin Bieber funs obviously.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaGreat,i recommend.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaO reala capodopera!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitagreat movie, Geoffrey is the man !
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaIf you want to build muscle, you should look up on Google &quot;Smashing Ripped X&quot;. They can guide you and help you get the body you deserve.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis movie has cost 13.5 million and it is a masterpiece, aside from The Great Gatsby, which cost 105 million. But the world is going to see it anyway, because the name Di Caprio&#39;s attraction no matter if the movie is crap, that resembles a carnival of Rio de Janeiro, than a movie.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitabest movie ever, worst ending ever. I wished i didnt watched it.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWhat a great movie!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitawhile the commenter was ridiculously inarticulate, they had a point.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathe best movie ever
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathing is, william blake doesn&#39;t have to be alive because he wrote shit that can be differently interpreted and appreciated every time you read it
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathe best offer and the best act of scamming = d best movie.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAll the info about the film on INDIE-LECTUAL.BLOGSPOT
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitabest movie
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaLol smartass take the worst example go ahead. No wonder you ignored songs like &quot;Beautiful &quot; ,&quot;Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Haile&#39;s song&quot; and many others that have deep meaning and impossible wordplay. Oh and btw when i said a better rapper I meant someone who&#39;s still alive, that I can expect new songs from him. Sure great respect for Biggie BUT he&#39;s highly overrated cause of his early death. 2Pac is a better rapper than Biggie and Shady is better than both. Different level. Anyway this video ain&#39;t about music
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaLyrics as in &quot;fuck you&quot; x33 ? Read William Blake.
As for better rapper - Biggie.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYeah I am. Find me a better lyricist or generally a rapper and then we&#39;ll talk again
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWas he? He exploited his position as famous antique appraisal. He had multi-million collection and payed next to nothing for it.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaIf it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re using &#39;eminem&#39; as avatar. Enough said.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies i ever watched if not the best.. Everything in it is perfect. Everything.
Note that i&#39;m pretty cynical person, and i don&#39;t say these things quite often.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaconcealed in every forgery
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYes, but that doesn&#39;t exclude the possibility that the trailer sucks (and in my opinion, this trailer is beautiful) but the movie is awesome!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathere&#39;s always something authentic.... the else part? cant recognize it... 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaLol don&#39;t get all butthurt on me cause i find your favourite movie kinda gay. I never watched any of those movies you talk about. Especially battleship. It&#39;s as gay as this one
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitastick to watching transformers and battleship. that&#39;s classified for people like you
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitahmm but the biggest backstabber was his *so called* best friends so... don&#39;t trust other humans? hehe
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWhat a great movie to see.... 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThe end was unexpected for me :)
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaCinematography wise i was impressed with Argo not amazed impressed. Though i enjoyed Django very much it was not one of Quentins best and it was not Oscar material Pulp Fiction was and Jackie Brown. I wouldnt of minded if Lincoln won that movie was top notch of course but Ben did a good job in Argo mainly becuase he did not over act. I dont know Oscars and shit sucks anyway Cult movies are the best becuase thoose fans know whats good. Like Donnie Darko watch that. 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaFunny how a man that looks like you said that. 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is fucking cool but even if you don&#39;t think so we all agree that this is an amazing movie. It blew my mind and is one of the best i have seen in 10 years cinematography wise especially besides Hugo which its intresting how both of thoose movies have something very similar. 

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaLIKE 


zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThe what are trailers for? If you don&#39;t like the trailer then you won&#39;t watch the movie right?
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was amazing. but the ending made me wanna punch her in the face. Moral of this story don&#39;t trust women. 

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWhat does &quot;bias&quot; mean?
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYou can not judge a movie by its trailer! And I refrain myself from saying something about what you say about the range for this movie -.-
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWhat a beautiful movie.  He gets screwed big time but at least he finally lost his virginity!!!  LMFAO 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitame after watching --&gt; D: .... watch this.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaGeoffrey Rush seems to be morphing into James Woods.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaArgo for once, how the fuck was it better than Dejango? Ben afleck didn&#39;t even do anything. The entire plot was completely revealed in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaIt has to be good because Jim Sturgess is in it.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaSeriously what&#39;s so interesting about this movie?For you to act this way my only guess is that the trailer sucks and makes the movie look bad.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathis movie is fake
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaDude is that the age when your brain will be fully developed? because that&#39;s all you need to watch this movie.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaItalian, Australian, American... whatever. It&#39;s classified for people over 60 years old dude.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaBarbossa! haha!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaI swear to you guys, this is the most mysterious movie you&#39;ll ever see very smart, very.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaLet us never forget how hot Jim Sturgess is.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaGeoffrey is so getting a Oscar nomination
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaIt looks kind of interesting 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaNot really suspense. It&#39;s a drama and a mystery, but not a typical one.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaMore melodramatic version of Penelope?

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaSo is this a mystery movie? a suspense? I&#39;m lost, but looks okay
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaso old dude gets to bang a young chick. good for him. 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaSaw it today... it was fantastic!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaTornatore = great movie ALWAYS!!!!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaDefinitely great movie!

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaSaw it at Berlinale, this is a masterpiece, guys!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaA really great movie with astonishing actors (Rush, Sutherland) and all you can say is &quot;old fuck young&quot;...*clap, clap,clap*
Go fuck yourselves to the nearest McDonald while watching Transformers 3...
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaone of the best film in this time!!!

zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAgain, you show your ignorance. You don&#39;t care about the facts. You just want to rant. Your comments are based upon your emotions - not logic. Maybe you should read a book every now and then. Take a psychology course. Go to school. I am sure you can learn something about life so you can stop being such a moron
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAhahahha! You are American right? ;)
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaeww.... old man and a freaking girl i dunno if im gonna watch it...its gonna be disturbing llol
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t underestimate this movie, guys. I&#39;ve seen it and it&#39;s fantastic.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaI never said that only my opinion matters and I don&#39;t think at all, that everyone needs to have the same opinion as me.
And yes, sometimes I judge a movie by its trailer and decide I don&#39;t want to watch it, but to declare to a movie, that isn&#39;t an aweful spoof of a famous franchise, that it sucks balls by only watching 1:40 minutes of the whole film is unfair and narrow-minded. The movie obviously isn&#39;t for everyone and it is likely to be boring for some people.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYou, superficial americans! You and your stupid commercial movies! Your brain is so limited!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaNot a British movie, an Italian one. And not stupid, not at all! You should watch it!
And unfortunately it&#39;s not nominee for the Oscar
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaYou are soooo superficial!!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaSmh &amp; since when was it declared that only your opinion matters??? Not everyone has the same opinion as you &amp; those that don&#39;t decided to critique a trailer &amp;,like them,I think that this movie will end up sucking the back of my balls.Looks extremely boring
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaEvidently you live in a fantasy world where that kinda stuff doesn&#39;t happen.Look around,it goes on in the real world more than you&#39;d like to admit
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaNo, they do it to shock people, and they just got to you.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaHow can you people critic in such an offensive way against a movie, which you haven&#39;t even seen so far? To me it looks quite interesting!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitalove Tornatore
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitahjghmghnmghjng
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitawhoremoans*
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaDumbledore!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaWait it weird an old man having sex with a young woman
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaOscar who?
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshita0:40 world&#39;s scariest ladder.
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitafsda
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaI smell oscar
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaReally? It&#39;s Geoffrey Rush, one of thje best actors today and the refferenc you guys have is Captain Barbosa?.. SAD!!!!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitasome call it the &quot;acting&quot;
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaAye aye Cap&#39;n!!!
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitathis is what Barbossa does in his spare time between movies 
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaCreepy old man
zJGleGyahC8delimeterByIshitaThis looks like it could be legitimately a creative, intense, intellectual yet creepy movie. I&#39;m intrigued.

B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaPenelope looking like Piek from AOT
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI was going to watch until I seen it was Woody Allen... literally makes the most boring films
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaLove how the vibe and cinematography makes it feel like we’re in Barca ourselves
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaThe most fuq-up love story ever. I dun understand why people can&#39;t atleast move one once they are married. They must be really fuck up individual.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaIf soulmates do exist then mine is a cross between Scarlett&#39;s character Cristina in this movie and Mary Wollstonecraft. However, while admire Cristina for her courage I would never want to share my soulmate with anyone.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the worst films ever made by mr. Allen<br>What happen to him? He was so cool
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWhen Sepia filtering is too much...
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI fell in love with Penelope Cruz’s character since I saw Vanilla Sky.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaRare for me to like Romance movies. But this..

B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaSpeak English😂😂😂😂
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaJavier Bardem is so cool in this movie.<br>He should make more romantic movies.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI cant believe I came to know abt this movie NOW😂
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaJavier Bardem :Hombre Con Suerte...
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaTerrible movie,people are you insane ? The  movie action is sick,shows how may lightweight women there are,unbelieving women, life in threesomes , are you joking the you liked this movie.<br>The worst movie ever seen.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaquel film génial !
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitadoes sb know where i can watch this movie ?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaJavier Bardem is a lucky man
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI need to always double check the film directors because as soon as the unnecessary narration came into play, I just knew it was a Woody Allen film. The movie would have been 10x better without it...guess woody allen style isn&#39;t it for me
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaAyer por la noche ví esta pélicula. Realmente me encanto, tiene muy buenos diálogos, momentos y conceptos sobre ciertas cosas muy ciertas.<br>Un grande Woody Allen.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWow  just wow 🤩💙
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaIdk why i never even saw this fucking movie i only saw the trailer when it came out but it’s been ringing in my head all fucking day with a spanish guy saying niki cristina barcalona for some fucking reason please leave me alone idk how the fuck my brain even remembers this
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaIt says Barcelona in the title, but it doesn&#39;t mean that. The amount of fucks not given about location in this movie is upsetting: they&#39;re just throwing Gaudi in your face, and think they&#39;re good.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaGreat now I don&#39;t have to scroll all the way down to read comments
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI love Woody Allen movies. But this is one is just stupid, full of stereotypes : of course, wealthy, young, beautiful people and an....artist . Add a fake philosophy about love... Woody Allen probably thought of Marivaux the French playwright Marivaux ... but Allen proves that nobody can imitate this genius... you can not obtain a subtle message with stupid actresses from Hollywood ! But fortunately we still have Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and her sisters, Crimes and misdemeanors !
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaMúsica of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-RdUcXAKiw&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a>?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI look at these Weinstein and Woody Allen movies in a totally different light now
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaA pseudo-artist seducing two dim witted American yuppies on vacation.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaPenélope is the best
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaLuckily not a woody&#39;s fan, so i can truly appreciate the great work of visual treatment and artistry in this movie. It&#39;s absolutely delicious treat 😋😋
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already more than 10 years ago when i watched it, unfortunately with my mom, at the theatre!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitajoey d anyone?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWell, this was fucked up.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI know a lot of people like Scarlet Johanson and every girl is beautiful in her own way but Penelope is so natural and gentle her beauty just outshines everyone around
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaJust enjoy the movie - it&#39;s not your life or mine, just a wild story.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaPenélope freaking Cruz i live her so much omg
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is the footage so yellow??? Looks like some instagram shit.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI loooooove Javier &amp; Penelope!&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaplz...forced to watch this on a plane...pretentious garbage...
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaNow hhhwat shall I say?<br><br>Oh really??<br><br>Good for you Voodie!

B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaSoutheast,Southwest European,Mediterian love,latin male
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaFor a uni homework we have to look for steretypes of cultures in the media. i&#39;ll just show this trailer
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI was going to watch this...now I kind of already know what happens!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaewww man.WOODY ALLEN.why u so woody! Try making a threesome with A GIRL and THREE GUYS😀 Only then will I find such a movie socially acceptable!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWoody Allen  is an obscene man 😂 .. I like allens movies so much .. I&#39;m inspiring actually 😌
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitawtf did i just watch
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaRidhima malhotra thinks that this movie is 5/5 stars.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaAs someone who lives in Barcelona, this movie (from the clip) seems to show nothing about the real culture of the city (or the Catalan culture).<br><br>This is a shame in my opinion, because the city and the Catalan culture is extremely rich (from art and architecture, to food and music) yet it shows none of this.<br><br>For me, personally, this is very sad given that this has a famous cast and director and therefore this movie will be watched by many. There is not alot of Hollywood movies based in Barcelona, and for the city and Catalan culture to be so misrepresented is a shame.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitalike wat the actual freak i mean there was no meaning of this movie
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s name of the song? at the begining of triler
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaThat dude&#39;s ex wife is the craziest chick I ever seen
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitalucky bastards !!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaomg i want to be this guy
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaThe worst film of Woody Allen, all confusion,  hanky-panky, ludicrous....boring!!!!!!!!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitanice movie....but they messed up in ending
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaThere was no porn or threesome.... the movie is sensual ... I loved!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitagreat film, terrible trailer
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitathat scene with penelope n scarlett kissing..
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaDafuq that&#39;s basically the whole movie! -_-
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaControl is an illusion believed only by those who blindly <br>persist to remain ignorant. <br><br>Emotions are not meant to be controlled.<br>Passion is not meant to be tamed.<br>Love is not meant to be understood.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaGood movie needed some nudity.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaProvocative filmmaking at its best!!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaCame on SBS last night, caught the last third - it was very good to watch
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitavicky cristina inieeestaa
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitawoody allen + barcelona...ooh i cant wait to watch this and be reminded of how magical and sexy barcelona is.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaShows how much people suffer when they allow their emotions to rule them instead of their thought. Emotion and passion must be there but it must know its place and life must be balanced
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite films ever.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitabrilliant film!!!!
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitapurrrrfect
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t believe they r trying to make people think this is ok.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitakinda unique movie.. i watched this bcos i saw there are so many hollywood stars appearing in this film especially The Black Widow and Mr. Raoul Silva, i am not a typically romance drama though.. quite boring at the middle.. i can&#39;t say there is so many life-lessons in this movie, but they have quite good lines i think.. &quot;only unfulfilled love can be romantic&quot;.. the words that came from bastard&#39;s mouth.. LOL
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song playing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-RdUcXAKiw&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a>?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI watched this because thought that it was about an adventure in Barcelona where I want to go, with just a little bit of romantic comedy. But it was completely cheesy, oversweet touristy romance that didn&#39;t have any originality or sharpness to it. The guy there talked with so ridiculously stereotypical pick up lines that after watching I thought it was a parody, like Naked Gun or something. I did like the acting of both female characters, although the story was awful and couldn&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t get tired of this cheesy guy, and Penelope Cruz&#39;es character was the only not overly boringromantic and a little bit energizing element to it. <br>Otherwise, be warned. It is nothing about Barcelona, just an American tourist impression of non-minimalist sweetness and cheesy pick up lines
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaThe most expensive 3-some of all time.<br>The movie.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaeets
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaanyone who knows the track playing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-RdUcXAKiw&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a> ?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know the song starting at 0.47?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaYes, Woody Allen is a genius for making a threesome acceptable.  Only in a rich, artsy life is such superficial ideas accepted.  
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI &lt;3 Woody Allen movies! He&#39;s a genius! <br>Great vibe, great feelings, great story lines, great actors, great presentation of environment (feels like you&#39;re there, Barcelona, Paris, everywhere) and definitely great non-conventional but NATURAL approach of society
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI agree
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitai LOVE your profile pic &lt;3
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Dr. Maya Hansen and Natasha Romanoff /Black Widow doing here???
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitanbn
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaokaaayyy, WTF?
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaGood film but feels like a car advert at times.
B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitamaaaaaaaaaaaaaad

B-RdUcXAKiwdelimeterByIshitaI enjoyed the trailer. 
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaHOW DO THESE MOVIES KEEP GETTING FUNDED.

They make me want to die.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever done that, but you are probably right.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThe whole series of these films such as Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, 4, Epic Movie, Superhero Movie, and Meet The Spartans are funny, but despite this they get heavily panned by critics. So pretty much it&#39;s like what&#39;s the point?
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaanyone got a gun?
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai like the part when they were making fun of hannah montana.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYour comments are actually funnier than this film looks.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYeah, I wouldn&#39;t wish anyone to die, but I couldn&#39;t help lolling in the cinema over it...
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThis film looks terrible, but the Hannah Montana bit is totally worth it.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer started off with the same boring crap.

But at the end I had actually cracked a smile.

So it&#39;ll probably be better than the last films, but that doesn&#39;t say too much.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitalooks like a disaster indeed
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaL00KS LlKE AN ANAL SHlT CRAP 0F A FlLM!!!!!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathis movie is going to be sooo awful
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaoh boy... this is gona suck
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaLol hannah montana sucks!!! u all know it true
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaatomic bombs are funnier than this movie.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita1 of them was crista flanagin
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYES YES YES i cant wait i love these kind of movies
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai totally agree she should die
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathese movies are getting old but I would like to see that bitch hannah montana die
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThey need to stop making these god damn horrible 
f-in movies. Fu*k the director and the Fu*k the writers.  Write a good movie like Planet Terror, Gladiator, or The Departed. Go work at McDonald&#39;s instead of making bad movies -10 out of 10
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;Hannah Montana is dead!&#39;&#39;
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitahaha..funny &amp; weird :|
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitayour a dumbass 12 year old aren&#39;t you
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThe first like tree movies like this were funny then it just kinda went down hill.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaUsually these movies come out really bad, but this one might be decent...
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathey gotta stop making movies like this
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai think that every movie theater for this movie should be replaced with a giant gas chamber
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaim prolly only gonna watch it cause KIM K. is in it!!!!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitano......
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaAh? Wth?

I really Hope Hannah Montana Dies
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitahahahaur funny
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThank you for that brilliant and well thought through addition to this internet.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called a parody, it doesn&#39;t mean anything, they&#39;re all just jokes. People usually want to hear jokes when they go to a comedy movie.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThe guys who keep making these need to be shot.... NOW! 

I swear, if they parody Joker...
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitais the person at 1:06 suppose to be the White Chick guy?
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna suck so bad
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita&quot;is that your feet?&quot;
&quot;and this is my baby&#39;s foot!&quot;

disaster or not, you gotta admit that part was funny
lol
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita&quot;tee hee me&quot;?...watever...
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitayes
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaBut this movie is SO BAD.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason people go see these is to laugh at how bad they are.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYou people should be ashamed if you actually find this bullshit funny.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaWas it Marylin Manson at the last part?
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita-_- this movie will suck sow fucking baddd....!!!! jost like meet the spartans and epic movie. wow what the hell is happening 
really..
the only movie that is really good was Scary Movie 1,2,3 the 4 sucks  
and superhero movie is another crap. 

and the best one Not Another Teen Movie.XD 

making fun of other commedy is jost not funny.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYeah, this films gonna be a disaster.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaehhhhh honestly i havent seen meet the spartans, was it worth watching? and would this probably suck? lol
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitalol!!!!!!!!!!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai thought that when scary movie came (1 and 2) it was hilarious you know. it was different. but now..its like this should just be a small sketch on a tv show and not a movie..man even sketches on tv shows are way better than this..its funny that the people from mad tv do a better job on the show than performing the same character in a movie..just saying.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaScary Movie, Date Movie, Fantastic Movie, Superhero Movie, Disaster Movie...

BORING. I will not see any movie of these.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitahaha wow kim kardashian is in this wat a loser! hahaha
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has FAIL written all over it.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaI feel the same way you do its getting really old! They would be better off just taking the money they have from the other movies they&#39;ve made &amp; not making anymore!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m not gonna lie, green day is the shit. i&#39;ve loved them since &#39;89.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai can wait till they sell illegal copies.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitagreeday is gey listen to like rage againts tyhe machine or system of a down
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitafucking christ they realy really REALLY have to stop making movieslike this

tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitahahahaha hilarious !!!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaThis film doesn&#39;t even reference any disaster movies!

tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaim so gonna watch it!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a DISASTER alright
Teh only funny part in that whole trailer is when that girl gets hit by a car
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitautter crap utter low budget crap waste of time
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaAND THIS HAS THREE OUT OF FIVE POINTS?????

Whats up with you people??
I mean it actually looks like a parodie on these kind of spoof movies. Two steps below even Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans.
And there are still enough people who will actually go and watch this crap and pay these people money so they can make &quot;ASS- the movie&quot; or &quot;Date movie 5&quot;!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita*sigh* Stop tourturing the Wayans Brothers with your boring parodies you good-for-nothing, low-life, dumb-stricken, do-nothing-but-look-at-terrific-action-movies-and-turn-them-into-crap writers!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitayep
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitai know i am going to see it just to have some good ol fun, and if your not down with that i got two words for ya SUCK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitawell that just proved my point, this isent comedy im assuming you enjoyed date movie epic movie and meet the spartans?  go back to elementary and study because you obviously have no intellegence and are lacking in study.  go watch a real spoof comedy like airplane or the monty python flicks.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitayou obviously are 12 13 if you think this looks funny.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaFUCK THESE MOVIES FUCK THESE FILMMAKERS FUCK TODAYS MOVIES.  anyone who thinks this is funny or goes to see this is really helping the destruction of human society and knows nothing about art or film.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathis looks freiking hilarious
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaWOW I JUST KILLED MYSE..........
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaright on.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitagood work buddy, im with you all the way, people like ElenaAnneRamos don&#39;t deserve to have an opinion (to be perfectly frank) the fact that they actually spend their money to see these movies speak more about there &#39;intelligence&#39; than anything else could.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitawell if anything buy a ticket to another movie and see disaster movie, dont give these assholes aaron seltzer and jason friedberg any more money.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaim just trying to keep you from losing more brain cells from watching these painfully unfunny movies.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaExactly, i KNOW you find this hilarious...and it speaks in VOLUMES about your intelligence.

I can seriously see you watching this movie going &quot;HAHAHA iron man got hit by a cow! HAHAHA the hulk got his pants pulled down! hannah montana got hit by a comet! HAHAHA the girl from enchanted got hit by a car! HAHAHA hancock hit a streetlight!&quot;

If you seriously found that funny than you are a completely witless individual who appreciates witless (humor or lack thereof).
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaWell considering you dont give shit about your own brain cells decreasing from watching these movies, you should be glad that someone (me) does.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaYep...it does seem like a DISASTER movie all right.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita...wow way to prove my point i wasnt talking about hannah montana i was talking about the movie and how only people with IQs the same as their shoe size find these movies funny.
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaof course you didnt get it  because i didnt throw in a stupid hannah montana reference
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshita...And somewhere in the heart of texas your parents regret keeping you so close to the microwave while you were in the womb...
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaAt least the title is fitting
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitalol go Juno pawned sex and the city
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitalooks funny
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck?!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathe worst thing about this piece of crap is that people are going to see it
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitathis looks like another peace of  shit art
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitalol this looks like fukin bullshit haha but ill still see it
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitaSounds good! Hope it&#39;ll be better than Meet Spartians and superheros movie...!
tihG_2BSUqgdelimeterByIshitao shit could this shit suck any more?
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaBut one thing I realize in Rocky&#39;s film is that he always fight against a black guy besides in Rocky 4 an 5 I guess
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI remember first time they announce it in 2005 I was crazy waiting for this movie ... My best movie and best character is ROCKY .
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaMan,,,how i hate rap-shit ! Hope non of this crap is in the movie. If you wanna talk , do it but dont call it music !
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI think Ian watching SULTAN&#39;S trailer
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThis one is hands down the best Rocky movie out of the franchise
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitavayy balboaa lan varya hepsini izledim
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThis is the only movie series which rhymes with my life
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaStallone is THE MAN!!  And his own personal creation, Rocky Balboa, is without doubt the most legendary and inspiring fictional character in modern American History.  <br><br>Also, the urban grit, endearing poignancy, compelling power, underdog fantasy and indomitable spirit of the long running Rocky saga has helped define, to this significant and impressive degree, this large slice of the struggling and insecure blue collar segment of our society over the past 4 decades.  <br><br>For in a sense Rocky&#39;s story is that of working class America, as there are many striking parallels (Rocky&#39;s accrued millions, mansion and fame notwithstanding).  Amazing!!  Yo Rocky, ya did it!   
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaWow! it&#39;s all ready been ten years.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThe best Rocky film since the first one...until Creed lol. That&#39;s not a knock on this movie either, both this and Creed are phenomenal films.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRIP Tony Burton!
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaCAN YOU DO IT!
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky is a great franchise, one of my favorites. All the movies are awesome, except Rocky V and Rocky IV that is fine.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaExcelente Filme, terminando de assistir todos, para amanhã assistir Creed.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaWon^
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaHe just by one hit
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitathis trailer always gets me pumped

8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI do like your movie of you alot. I m big fan
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky best ever , i started to see all his movies and are awesome i am 19
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaNo I think it&#39;s really really sad! Please don&#39;t let Rocky die let him live till Stallone dies! Also they should change the lion at first and make it a tiger to represent Rocky (Stallone)
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitanever give up! never stop believing!
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky 7 its coming next month!
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaWhere you watching this movie complete in Internet
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThe last bit of that trailer just gets the heart pumping everytime.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky is still wearing his wedding ring <b>cries</b>
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaMan may be tough but dumb at the same time
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky Balboa is my favorite Rockymovie :) . This movie really captured the events from the old movies and memories :).  Sylvester Stallone still got it when plays Rambo and Rocky :)
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaLove this trailer. Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been almost 10 years now since this movie was released. 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaAin&#39;t nothing over till it&#39;s over lol 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThis was good, the one I wasn&#39;t a fan of was the 5th one. The others were good actually better than this one and the 5th one. Still like this one. Can&#39;t wait for creed to come out in theaters 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitamuhteşem
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tab8fK2_3w&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> what is music
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitayou never old for what you love to do
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who finds it heart breaking thar Rocky Balboa will have cancer in Creed?
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant trailer. Those last few seconds with the eye of the tiger tune epitomised everything about growing up with this character during the 80&#39;s. Long live Rocky.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaCLASSIC trailer? cmon it&#39;s not been so long
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be the exact same thing with may weather and manny pacquiao 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaman what happen to stallone , i mean look at this masterpiece compare to now with his crappy movies :/ 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitagreat movie..number 5 is that good..but this end series just great..
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitano kidding hi def. that picture is incredible! 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, still got goosebumps watching this trailer. 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should be better
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaAfter more than 15years... its a suprize
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaThey should make a rocky 7 but switch him to fighting with jiu jitsu. hell Helio gracie was fighting all the way till 95 and the died he died she still did jiu jitsu. Rocky needs to meet jiu jitsu. 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer and thinking there is no way to make this credible. Yet Sly and company somehow made it happen. Well done.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitathis flim had to be made to show how a boxer or even a great man feels and he told us all well done rocky 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitabest rocky movies ever
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitai watched an interwiev with Sylvester and loved his words: Rocky is not just movie.. Rocky means... theres always chance somewhere out there ...
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaafter seeing the trailer i feel like i&#39;ve watched the whole movie, lol.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI bet you all didn&#39;t know that a spinoff to Rocky called &#39;Creed&#39; is being made 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tab8fK2_3w&amp;t=1m46s">1:46</a>?
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaROCKY,S THE BEST
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tab8fK2_3w#t=1m23s">1:23</a>?
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaDixon is no match to Rocky.. just think if Dixon would win against the badass Drago.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie will be crap made only for money, but after watching this I can only say that this is good old Rocky that we all love.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaRocky Balboa (2006) - OST\03-bill_conti-going_the_distance.mp3
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitamason dixon is floyd mayweather lol
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitai mean (a) sorry for my grammar

8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaand its I shame now days people aren&#39;t like rocky and all they are are duchbags

8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitathis is so inspirational for espesialy when u r a martial-artist like me and I say this from my bottom of my heart it feels an honor for watching all the rocky movies from the start till the end 
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaMason Dixon is a little bitch. He has no idea what rocky has been through.
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaIt aint about how hard u hit, its how hard u get hit and keep moving foward-rocky
8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitavery good

8tab8fK2_3wdelimeterByIshitaGoing to show these movies to my kid to make a man out of him.

l2vPDGStL4kdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like yesterday when I saw the first one with my mother in theaters back in 2002
l2vPDGStL4kdelimeterByIshitaSo, when did Anthony Anderson&#39;s character get out of jail? I&#39;m guessing he&#39;ll be playing a whole new character, but that&#39;s just...never mind.

IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaTikTok made me come
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshita: I Shared this Photo On Facebook.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaBecause of this movie, we now know the lapd has always been corrupt!
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this along time ago and I have been searching for it because I live so close to where the events took place
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is masterpiece one of the best in cinema history 😉👍
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI hate Angelina, she is not a good actress
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaWhose here after last episode of The Cocktail and Crime from Duku and Dulmaa :)
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaHere from cadaber
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaNotice how those policemen treated the child as an object that can interchanged? They themselves maybe perverts and they use their position to protect other perverts. If the psychopath is a natural born criminal the narcissist sociopath is a natural born pervert. They are the reason serial killers and necrophiliacs etc. flock to southern California. The perverts know where it is safe. They are the reason why ancient Rome and Greece was filled with depravity. These people have an agenda. Unfortunately they are too cunning to get rid off once they enter an organization. They network with one another from different ranks and states and protect and cover from one another. If they have a narcissist supervisor then it gets even worse.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaBuena película de drama
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaThe true nightmare that&#39;s not depicted here is what actually happened to her boy.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI legit cried watching this Angelina Jolie is freaking awesome in it
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI think I already watch this Movie but I am here to check if this is good or not because I am hunting great Movies from 2008 because a loot of Movies I know way back in 2008 are great and amazing. I usually dont like watchinng trailers so I scroll trhough comments hahaha
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaNot to trivialize a terrific movie, but I couldn’t get over the roller skates. So not only did you have to handle a switchboard, you had to roller skate: what Liam Neeson in one movie calls “an  unusual set of skills”.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t know this movie was directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaNot much has changed ( the police still cover up ) They also, cover for their own.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaNo mention of Angelina Jolie in the cast description yet she plays the central character of this movie. How strange.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI never heard about this movie until seeing it on demand. I legit thought it was a earlier version of the hole in the ground based on the name and plot description. Completely different movie and I somehow missed the based on a true story part. I liked it, very long movie but worth it.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaaward-winning istg this movie is perfection
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the trailer music composer?
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry that is so underated, even deserves prices
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaBeeing a true story, its a proof for the people that from the moment you have guts to fight, keep fighting, more of them would and win. Only fighting you can win
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaWhen I was camping my uncle told us the “chricken coop story” he called it. We live in California and he actually lives in the city it happened in he lives close to the house. So yeah now I’m gonna watch the movie lol
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaChangeling have chapters two? Or not?
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie stuck in my mind from the 1st time I watch this.
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitathis movie is so underrated
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaWhat an extraordinary movie it is, amazing story, acting, dialogues screenplay . . loved every bit of this movie
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was perfection! Angelina Jolie is such an amazing actress! 💞💝💗
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaits a true story
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not the only one who saw this at nine in Spanish on Telemundo right-
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaShould make statue for that mother &amp; son to represent loving mother waiting her son to end life 😭
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitafor anyone who has actually seen this, is this about the boy being a literal changeling or is it just about a cover up?
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshita🔥🔥🔥 <br> I got such positive feedback about the film <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF5hwg4FNEU&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a> 🔥💖🔥💃 <br>  👇 👇💗

IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t cristy ask the boy (the one who reported gordon)  what happened that night when collin and two others ran away.  Who got caught.  If the one got caught was william collin.  Then where they burried him. Then she will maybe get her closure. I dont understand the story
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI can’t stand Angelina Jolie
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s here after the Buzzfeed Unsolved episode of Walter Collins?
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaImal nekog sa Dusanovog profila ovdje
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaSavrsen Film👌
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer don’t do the movie justice
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitahaunting story. shocking but extremely well done
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshitaI watched this when I was seven or eight.... Messed me up for life.....
IF5hwg4FNEUdelimeterByIshita I Don&#39;t recommend this movie, pretty poor show.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOnce is a great drama-music movie. i hope this one is good too
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAdam Levine sucks so bad
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitawhy no mention mos def?! why?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaBest movie that I saw this weekend was &quot;Noah.&#39; If your a fan of writer director Darren Aronofsky and his films &quot;Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream and the Wrestler&quot; then you will love &quot;NOAH.&quot;
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitafollow me on intagram i follow back acefmspace
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI just had a tiny orgasm when it said &quot;From the director of ONCE&quot;.<br><br>This is gonna be good.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshita&quot;A guy like that falls on his luck for a couple of years; people lose sight of who he is.&quot;
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOMG! Was that Adam Levine?!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaYay for new Keira K movie &lt;3 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaSadly , In &quot; Real Life &quot; you stay Alone......Sick I Know
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaADAM LEVINE + KEIRA KNIGHTLEY = PERFECT COMBINATION &lt;3
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitawhat is the tittle of the song that keira sang in the bar??
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a really good movie :) &lt;3 wholesome.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI see we&#39;re hollywood&#39;s taking out the trash for the 12th consecutive summer.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaNice trailer<br>ps: Fuck the police
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaTo all the people going &quot;Adam Levine?? Really?!?&quot; please enlighten yourselves with  scenes from his stint on American Horror Story. Hes surprisingly good on that show. Plus it ain&#39;t like he&#39;s straining himself acting wise here so I think his performance will be all right
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThe Year of Mark Ruffalo is upon us! So happy to see three (four actually if that Polar Bear movie gets released this year) potentially great movies starring him coming out this year! 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOMG  i need to see it!!!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaseems like a &quot;feel-good&quot; movie...like Lyrics &amp; Music...I think am gonna watch this :)
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaseriously MOVIECLIPS Trailers ? ud put lavine&#39;s name in the title instead of the hulk&#39;s? the fuck kinda shit u advertising. he&#39;s prolly in the movie for about 5-10 mins.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAdam 4 life 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a good movie , i will watch it :$
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this is going to be a good one. Love the casting (KEIRA AND MARK ARE THE BEST) and the plot sounds interesting!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks promising :) 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t remember or really care about the Levine guy. Don&#39;t really care about Knightley either. The star performance is obviously Ruffalo! How can you not even mention him in the headline?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaannnnnnnnnd The end..your trailer just made this whole move the happy ending. =P
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI love Once. It&#39;s enough reason to watch this.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definitely gonna watch this movie! :)
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching this for you Keira Knightley
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaMy two favourite people, Keira Knightley and Adam Levine in the same movie!! How cool is that, obviously this is a must see and  can&#39;t wait!!  
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaLove love loveeeee Mark Raffalo
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitacould be charming if adam levine wasn&#39;t in it.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaSeems a very nice movie and all the actors omg i love them &lt;3 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if James Corden is still acting with Stormageddon? 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaa must watch.. ;)
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaCello greens awesome
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaRuffalo will make this good he makes everything good one of the best actors in Hollywood 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOH.... MY<br>Need to see iiiit &lt;3333
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks like it might be ok, especially thanks to Mark Ruffalo! 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaсудя по трейлеру фильм - херня.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaHell yeah Adam is so sexy imma watch that shit 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOh heeeelll yeah my babe Adam is on this. Imma definitely watch that shit.<br>
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaCrei q era sasha grey ._.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaMos Def
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaLOL this looks good.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaBy the guy who did ONCE? I&#39;ll watch it. 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitastarring the cast of the voice
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOooh interesting. I think I&#39;ll watch this.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitabetter to have dated Adam Levine and lost him that never dated him, right?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitai thought that was sasha grey
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThree people trying to change their imagine/expand their careers in one movie? I&#39;ll pass thanks.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaMark Ruffalo is much cooler than Adam Levine.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaYea she&#39;s actually a good singer :)
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaMark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley - I&#39;m there.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaFLOP!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshita[[Like]]O))/)))O~0~o:=!~
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaIs that Keira&#39;s real voice while singing? 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitawhat a combination of actors!!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitakeira&#39;s face in the video icon...and what&#39;s with her voice?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitawhy is adam levine in the title but no mark ruffalo? bullshit
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaIm actually very excited to see how adam levine acts! I just have a feeling that he will be great
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaIt will be great! *- *
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaWow,Keira Knightley sing a song,this is so perfect!!!! :D
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck is up with the dubbing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRCxOE7Xzc&amp;t=2m06s">2:06</a>?!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaYeah Now The Voice is on The big screen Too 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI love it when Keira knightly sings!!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a secret <br>I am always horny 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaplease!! does anyone know the first song? i&#39;ve been searching for an hour !
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitakeira has the same smile in every movie, so fake. so sad mark has to do this film with her
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaomg this looks so good
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThis going to be horrific , Adam Levine can&#39;t sing or act
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re displaying Adam Levine perfectly. He dumps all his girlfriends IRL too.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAdam Levine? Seriously? That ass-hole? He can&#39;t sing for shit unless you&#39;re into a Puberty hit Justin Bieber voice... And now he is trying to act?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitathis looks great lots of actors I love except for Adam Levine.. since when is he an actor smh.. doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s a main character though so ok I guess
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOfficial Trailer #1 (2014) - Keira Knightley,
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAgain Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Keira Knightley, Adam
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThat thumbnail, creeped me out more than the thumbnail for The Purge...
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaADAM 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaADAM AND CEE LO
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaWHY!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThis might be the first movie i&#39;ll be seeing hailie stienfield playing a regular 21st century teenaged girl character
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaI like the first song, does anyone know the title?
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks fun but it has James Cordon in it and I refuse to watch anything he is in.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaSo is Adam Levine playing himself :D
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaLooks really interesting, I&#39;m down!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaOnce was a great musical, I really love that movie. But this does not has that feel to it. Maybe the trailer is misleading.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaMos Def 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaSOMETHING DIFFERENT! 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaDamn. Looks good :D
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitagreat cast, james cordon take my money
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAdam Levine is in a movie? I didn&#39;t know he was an actor, period.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks exceptionally good :D It definitely looks like something I would put on my list
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like this movie is just one big ad for the Voice.  I might rent it though, throw Ruffalo a few sheckles. 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitathumbnail is weird as fuck hahaha
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaAdam Levine is hoooottttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitalooks like it could be alright<br><br>perhaps even pretty good.
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaCeeLo xD
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaThe Hulk high as shit being a music producer and shit
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaRuffalo is the king of looking unkempt 
uTRCxOE7XzcdelimeterByIshitaou
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitalame
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitalol... the only reason this movie will be popular is because of the twilight fan girls... ugh.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaallergic to vagina?
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaomg that looks so good im so looking forward to seeing it hes just the same in twilight  im not an obsssed fan i like kristen too  they make a cute couple just sayin but i just like robert as an actor hes good and hes got everythin i like in movies action.romance,comedy he always  makes me laugh so ya its not just his looks i like its his persianlity
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitawhat song is playing throughout the trailer?
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be a multimillion dollar movie cause EVERY twilight fan is going to see it just to get more of HIM. (This doesn&#39;t include me, you realize.)
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitacute..but i m not used with robert in other movies.only twilight saga..i mean is different but good! can&#39;t wait!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaFirst time hearing him speaking so much in America Accent, cute! lol...
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI totally agree he does  a lot of different movies that are weird but good. He kinda reminds me of James Dean but with way more intensity
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshita@kiak12  he is you should see little ashes its about Salvador Dali the artist and he acts just like him i mean spot on !
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI love Rob as Tyler and Ruby Jerins as Tyler&#39;s little sister!
I also love Tate Ellington as Aidan; I heard that he&#39;s hilarious in this film.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaeddie noooooooooooooooo don&#39;t cheat on bella!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitanot a big rob pattinson fan but this pretty good
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get why people are going all &#39;Shit, thats the Twilight guy!&#39; because duh, what did you expect? that he WANTS to be called the twilight guy? he wants and does more jobs. God, people judge fast.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitakinda seems like twilight but a different story lol
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitano F train is that clean -.-
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaRobert Pattinson again!? D:
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitano the one actor i hate has my name agg
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaand the other star i&#39;m starting to get sick of him and the girl from Twilight
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaOkay, i&#39;m not one of those twilight fanatics on Rob&#39;s ass in whatever he does. I do like the man though. This movie looks good. I hope it doesn&#39;t get ruined by chicks going crazy just because Rob (not Edward) is in it. I totally wanna see it
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI have nothing against Pattinson as a person, but Twilight has sort of ruined his reputation. Being in Harry Potter makes up for it though, and this movie looks quite fantastic. =]
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitahahahah
&quot;why why do you have an ash tray?&quot;
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitatrue! they even kept his hair the same haha
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitau noe... hes actually really cute! he just needs to shave all the time. Twilight make up makes him look fugly
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitail trailer promette bene..   .    :D
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaoh look edward from twilight
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitawow this might actually be a great movie
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like Twilight, it&#39;s an overall story that wasn&#39;t done well and has been done better before. But, I do admit, Rob&#39;s acting in this trailer wasn&#39;t half bad. And you know, I don&#39;t think of him as Edward, I think of his as Cedric Diggory from Harry Potter.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaListen, you 12 year old girl, go crawl back into your Twilight hole and stay the fuck off youtube until you learn to say some sort of constructive response, understand?
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaYou know...if he did more films like this, people might take him seriously.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaCHIRON!!!!! yay,  I like rob better here than in twilight [no offense twihards]
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitahottie old guy from james bond whoo!!!!..and havent seen emmile  de raven in a while..and robert pattinson&#39;s pretty face whooo!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me of Catcher in the rye. lol
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai agree!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai want  to watch this movie!!!!i like the plot and robpat is hot i mean in 1:22 he is hot.also i am agree with jooplyn17 it&#39;s nice to see robert in &#39;&#39;the real&#39;&#39; movie because twilight saga &#39;ll finish and the fans should understand that edward cullen is just a role for robert i mean he is actor.i think that &#39;&#39;remember me&#39;&#39; is a good chance for him!!! :-)
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshita@JellyBiscuitz That makes two of us :D
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitais he always gonna play a sad/tortured person from now on? show me some range!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaRob is a very talented and great actor ...he&#39;s different in every role...Cedric, Art, Dali, Edward, Tyler...and i think it&#39;s really a sign of mastery

Remember me rocks!!!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaOMG, Rob is very hot...
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaRob look so hot in this movie &lt;3
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitait actually seems like a cool movie, and I thought the guy couldn`t act to save his life
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitalol see i like robert in this movie more so then when he was in twilight ! idk why though
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaThe bowl completes the room lol. Too funny. Love this and of course love Robert...he&#39;s stepping up his game I&#39;d say! Can&#39;t wait :-).
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitait looks really cool....can&#39;t wait....

and Rob is brilliant...
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaCOOL! looks awesome! so which one do you think is better guys? Remember Me with Rob Pattinson or THe Runaways with Kristen Stewart?
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshita@kisaparty123 completely agree :)
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaemilie...is beaaatifull
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai actually auditioned to play Emilie&#39;s role sadly, as u can c, i didnt get the part but i still wanna c this movie rob looks amazing!!!! and she is a very lucky lucky lady so wanted that part :( 
P.S. this would have been my first movie
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait until this twilight crap is over with and we can see him in a different light...
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitavery emotional movie. i think rob pattinson will be much better in this because he has more dialogue
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaOmg i luv summit entertainments movies now! No wonder why its called Remember Me becuz they get torn apart! well finally i understand something lol! Cant wait too see this with my cuzin!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s a great actor.
I&#39;ve seen Twilight and New Moon.
I&#39;m reading Eclipse. 
well my point is I&#39;m not obssesed with the whole Twilight thing, but I love readint and watching it.
And I&#39;m Team Jacob btw
but Robert Pattison sure is an awesome actor.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitahes my hubby&lt;3
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaWtf another Twilight movie? LoL
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaHe can actually act!! Would not of noticed that based off of Twilight.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Robert Pattinson actually did something something decent for once.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI actually want to see this O.O
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaThis has great actors in it! LOOKS AMAZAING can&#39;t wait!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaHe does seem to be a fairly good actor. Too bad he only gets roles in bad movies.

It&#39;s my first original and I&#39;d love some feedback. If you like it tell your friends, subscribe, comment... Anything! Thanks

iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaOmigosh, I love Emilie de Ravin! She&#39;s so awesome as Claire! It&#39;ll be cool to see her as a student. Awesome!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaoh cool and with pierce :D
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaFinally something worth his time, unlike that shitty Twilight Saga.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitalooks good
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitamustache? beard?
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshita...i watch this trailer over and over again...
I LOVE IT!!!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait can&#39;t wait can&#39;t wait! I think that he&#39;s acting skills will reallyreally shine on this movie!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitasee..this one is going to be a good movie... will be better than &quot;The Last Song&quot;...
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaICHAMPION- 5,000 itunes copies sold in 7 days; INDI music!!!
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI read the end of the script
it&#39;s sooo shocking and sad
I wonder if they changed it in the movie
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks real decent
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitarob is better when he isnt edward.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI WANNA SEE ITT:)

iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitait looks great!! i want to see this movie ! I hope it comes to us in the cinema
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good. I laughed at the scene when he goes &quot;I guess it was here just to tease me&quot;.
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaOhhhh...looks good :)

And there were pics that these two were dating, but I think the paparazzi were just taking pix of them filming this, cause I remember that they took pics of a beach scene, and rob and emiline were wearing these exact clothes lol
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see Robert in this new project....he is really a good actor
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai wanna see this and i just saw new moon he looks amazing&lt;3

iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitathe only reason why i would watch it is because of pierce brosnan
iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitaI think I just vomitted in my mouth....give me a second.... ok.... better....

iFFas72-dTYdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m so excited about this movie - i saw the preview a couple of times on the internet and then it was the shown at the beginning of the movie last night -which was fantastic, by the way - and i&#39;m so excited to see what rob can bring to someone besides edward, oh and i&#39;m just all around impressed with summit, i&#39;ve gone back to see some of their other films like, the brothers bloom and bandslam, well done, great (not so obvious) plots that are able to convey real emotion and truth

-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie had its high, low, and so so moments so I give it a 5.5/10
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaTerminator 1 is good<br>Terminator 2 is good <br>Terminator 3: rise of the machines is crap <br>Terminator 4: salvation is good<br>Terminator 5: genisys is confusing and shit
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest trailers ever. But it&#39;s also the reason the movie didn&#39;t do well. It spoiled the movie by giving away Markus being a terminator and all the money shots
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaAca en chile y en concepcion ante los que hacen spoilers alguno que vemos estas peliculas imponemos que no tiene sentido en la vida real pero si en sciencia ficcion....9)))9)//...
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaJohn Conner high af, doing batman voice and all that shit haha
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely better than Genisys!
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaRip Anton Yelchin 1989-2016
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitarip anton yelchin
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitathe people they chose to play these characters were amazing, sucks that the movie wasn&#39;t to good
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m the only hope you have.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh gooooooood for you!&quot;
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis may be the greatest trailer of all time
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis was a badass trailer with full of hype.<br><br><br>The movie was somewhat disappointing. Still good though.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitathis is one of my fave films, should of contunued the story and bale for a following 2 movies  but they didnt....
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaterminator genisys is evenworse
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie illustrates how <br>a value system will determine what kind of a society <br>you end up with.  .. There was a time when <br>many believed <br>that to save a young woman, one only needed to <br>get her to a delivery room - that her value to God rested <br>in her ability to make babies.  They thought this because <br>they confused the word, childbearing, with childbirthing.<br>  See, 1 Timothy 2 : 11-15, kjv.  Be careful what you <br>assume to be true.  For logic (and, or emotion) will <br>lead you to certain conclusions, based upon those <br>assumptions.  Their name was Adam.  The man only <br>called her name Eve, AFTER the Fall.  A married couple, <br>being one in the flesh, is a She, a woman (two as one).<br>  Now a man who falls in love has wed, and if he remains <br>unmarried, and wed, there are three, he, she, and She,<br> a Virgin in the spirit, though she leave him for another,<br> She still is, unless he &quot;stops carrying a torch&quot;.<br> Uriah and Bathsheba come to mind.  Was she not yet <br>his wife, having died without &quot;divorcing her for<br> committing adultery&quot;?  Y&#39;know, like that Michael <br>Bolton song : &quot;When a man loves a woman - she can <br>do no wrong&quot;? .. Religion, literally means &quot;how you <br>live&quot;, with emphasis on HOW, as in, Does this man have <br>a Code of Conduct?  What code but love would cause <br>one to lay down his life for another?  In contrast, <br>machines respond to a central intelligence - this <br>machine to be salvaged, that one left to rust, and <br>no machine asks another if that is the optimal <br>solution.  &quot;Eh fellas, is Skynet wack, or what?&quot;<br>  Humans hesitate, tools do not.  &quot;Start, damn you..&quot;<br> Defribulator?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaSteve Jobs of Apple <br>Computer Inc., moved to the head of the line to <br>receive a new kidney, or liver, because he was <br>deemed a VIP (&quot;Very Important Person&quot;).  It was <br>not a case of &quot;first come, first serve&quot;.  Maybe <br>ability to pay should be the deciding (only <br>deciding?) factor?<br>  But they who control the money printing presses <br>might be eugenicists (&quot;racists&quot;).  Will they not see <br>the other &quot;races&quot; as cattle?  Or maybe a criminal <br>conviction should automatically demote you on <br>that list to receive medical attention - though you <br>may have &quot;grown as a person&quot; while in prison?  <br>Ironically, he who is close to God, <br>will He not repair him?  Will such a one fear <br>physical death?  Or will he simply not say, &quot;No, give <br>it to somebody else&quot;?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThey wish to COMPARE and <br>CONTRAST two lives.  Sodom was a place where <br>males desired to KNOW each other.  (Is it not written<br> in the Book of Revelations that the place where <br>the Lord Jesus was crucified IS spiritually called <br>sodom:  See, Rev 11:8, kjv.  Shall, means <br>a movement towards, and not, This will come to <br>pass - for certain.) Whether those males in sodom <br>had physical contact with each other, or weight-<br>lifting competitions, I know not.  To know another, <br>is a question of degree.  &quot;Can he be trusted? What <br>makes you think he can be trusted?  Your gut?&quot;  <br>Vikings - how &quot;tuity fruity, I want rudy&quot;?  <br>But when you create a criteria that establishes <br>one life as being more <br>precious than another, (&quot;he&#39;s got a bad knee&quot;), <br> how soon before a ruling elite look at a group of <br>persons as a resource for <br>organ transplant operations?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita&quot;We can salvage him&quot;.  <br>Perhaps they desire to create <br>a society where a ruling class will decide who <br>is a better person, You (perhaps you are an <br>uneducated African American with no prior <br>criminal convictions) OR say somebody else, a<br>stockbroker, in prison because<br> of a criminal conviction (tax evasion? murder?).<br> They have no desire to <br>ask God to tell them who is the better person, <br>for at least two reasons : <br>He refuses to hear, or answer them.  Or because<br> they do not believe He exists, wherefore why <br>why would they ask of Him?  There may be other <br>reasons, but these two strike me as the most <br>obvious as to why they ask not God to reveal to <br>them who is more important than another.<br>  Beatification, is that of God or of man?<br>  How does the Vatican decide who is a saint?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaso intense :o
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaBale: Am I going to walk around and rip your fucking lights down, in the middle of a scene? Then why the fuck are you walking right through? Ah-da-da-dah, like this in the background. What the fuck is it with you? What don&#39;t you fucking understand? You got any fucking idea about, hey, it&#39;s fucking distracting having somebody walking up behind Bryce in the middle of the fucking scene? Give me a fucking answer! What don&#39;t you get about it?<br>Shane Hurlbut: I was looking at the light.<br>Bale: Ohhhhh, goooood for you. And how was it? I hope it was fucking good, because it&#39;s useless now, isn&#39;t it?<br>Hurlbut: OK.<br>Bale: fuck sake man, you&#39;re amateur. McG, you got fucking something to say to this prick?<br>McG: This movie is shit but the trailer is going to look badass.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitareply if you&#39;re watching in 2016
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWhere the hell is arnold
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaNine inch nails makes any trailer &#39;THE BEST TRAILER&#39;. Here is a list of other movies with trailers that have Nine inch nails in them<br><br>1. 300<br>2. The Avengers<br>3. Gaurdians of the galaxy<br>4. Man on fire<br>5. The girl with the dragon tattoo (Red band trailer)<br>6. this trailer
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaHonestly..they might&#39;ve as well called this film the Conner chronicles since terminator is nowhere to be found in this film.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWe are f***ing done professionally.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitagreatest trailer ever made.....seriously.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best trailers ever.<br>And best Terminator movie of the century
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitahumans have a strength tht cannot be measured....I love tht qoute
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most badass trailers for movies ever. The movie didn&#39;t match the badass-ness, imo. I remember getting hyped about this movie when they first released the trailer.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI wish this movie had been half as good as the trailer, but then McG was always better at directing music videos than he was features.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI wish this movie had been half as good as the trailer, but then McG was always better at directing music videos than he was features.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like in 3 years we&#39;ll be fighting beside John Connor lets fuck em up!🔫
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitai am watchin it in 2015
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaGrit, mood and style of Terminator Salvation but with a better script and bigger budget anyone?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita&quot; most underrated movie ever&quot;<br><br><br>&quot; I do t like it, it&#39;s confusing &quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Read the comics you dumb-ass, there is so much you are missing. And you don&#39;t even understand the story because you only seen terminator 3
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaIF WE STAY THE COURSE, WE ARE DEAD, <b>WE ARE ALL DEAD!</b>
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitai really like this movie despite what people had to say
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gives me goosebumps everytime.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaarnold???
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaTo those wanting to know the name of the song it&#39;s called <br><br>The Day The World Went Away by Nine Inch Nails
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitagood film
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita1. Terminator 2: Judgement Day<br>2. The Terminator<br>3. Terminator Genisys<br>4. Terminator Salvation<br>5. Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI just luved the trailer more than anything...but I hated the movie more than anything
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI hate how the preview is better then the movie
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaSong is called The Day The World Went Away by Nine Inch Nails.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaTsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich - Jesus - Patrick Bateman - Quinn Abercromby - John Preston - Bruce Wayne - Alfred Borden - John Connor...
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaSong?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaReply if you are watching in 2015!
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING BACKGROUND MUSIC! Can anyone tell me what it is?
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaBatman, Beat John Connor!
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitathe movie was a piece of shit but the trailer is so fucking good
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaBello , Voto 7
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaAmazing trailer!
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaLoved this - a very decent film that could be a stand alone movie without the previous films. Better than T2 (yes, courting controversy).
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaJohn Conner: &quot;We are dead!  We are all dead!&quot;<br>Hudson: Game Over man! Game Over!<br>John clearly saw Aliens when he was younger
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaTermanitor 1, 2 are the best including Genysis<br>3 and 4 (salvation) sucked balls mostly salvation sucked ass
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaLooking at the comments, I&#39;m not the only one that felt this way. I thought it was quite a good movie and clearly underrated. <br>I&#39;ve never watched the original terminators and I so I feel like this allowed me to appreciate the movie rather than comparing it to the originals.   I always feel critics often get it wrong, there is so many genuinely good or of reasonably good quality movies they underrate.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was made 6 years ago, wow time really goes fast.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitano arnold= movie sucks
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI would have loved sequel to this... I am not able to connect emotionally with Terminator Genesis :(
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer deserves an Oscar for the music alone
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWhat are you guys talking about T2 was the best.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song thats playing in the background? 
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know why people hated this movie, all my friends and I quite enjoyed it.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaIm the only hope you have Terminator genesys, save the fanchise and fix that your movie shit did
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaTerminator salvation was the best movie since Terminator 2 Judgment day, it was a breath of fresh air and would have saved the series from the disastrous &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; which just killed the series. I am a great terminator series fan and I want my refund for Terminator Genisys!!!!!! <br>Really disappointed!<br>
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI personally favor this movie over the rest, it just has such a serious take on everything, and it&#39;s dark theme gives it a sense of the loss of hope, but the characters prove it otherwise
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis is Terminator 4 
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWow.... That trailer was way more hype than the movie though.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie could have been really good if they just focused on John Conner.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaA lot of people shit on this movie, but I loved it, and think it was a lot better than 3, and I think people have way too high of expectations about any new terminator movies when you know nothing will ever come close to the greatness of the first 2... at least this movie tried something different...
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaMe and this movie are fucking doneion rings professionally.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaHa. &quot;Rated R&quot;... (I know, Director&#39;s Cut being rated R, but this is not the director&#39;s cut trailer.)
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita&quot;IF WE STAY THE COURSE...WE ARE DEAD! WE ARE ALL DEAD!!!&quot; Awesome line delivery. 
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaLove this far better then that shitty turd genysis
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI know i&#39;m in the minority on this one, but I don&#39;t care, I liked this movie a lot. It had so many issues though and i&#39;m not gonna try to change anyones mind, but I still thought this film was brilliant for what it tried to do.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI am convinced that early reviews sank this movie. The critics judged it negatively and a lot of people let those reviews influence their opinions. But if you sit down to watch this, with no influence anywhere, this is a good movie. It has a style, a look(seriously, any one shot in this movie looks 100x more impressive and beautiful than the whole of Terminator Genesys.), atmosphere, good performances, it takes itself seriously enough, etc. Would you believe, I think many people immediately dismissed it because McG decided to go with a monochrome look as opposed to the blue tint James Cameron used AND because they also made the decision to use real guns and real bullets instead of the laser guns that were in the originals. That&#39;s my opinion.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaOH GOOOOOD FOR YOUUU
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitanowadays trailers like this spoil everything...
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI just watch this movie for the second time since his release and I can&#39;t understand how someone can like this better than the first two.<br><br>Underrated my ass, this shit is awful and boring.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaI feel like Im still waiting for this movie to come out. This trailer is thrilling but the movie was bland
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitabut he is batman...
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshita&quot;If we stay the course, we are dead, we are all dead!&quot;- John Connor              Talk about goosebumps. In my personal opinion, one of the best preview trailers ever, and a great Terminator film that is highly underrated. It&#39;s just good to know that I&#39;m not the only fan who thinks this. haha I loved the story! p.s. It came out on my birthday May 21, 2009, when I turned 18. :)
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaBatman yelling at robots.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is hollowed as a swiss cheese! Good actors, nice CGI, but the story makes it totally amateurish.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaVery underrated movie.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaFor me, this is the BEST Terminator Movie I have ever watched. Rise of the Machines came close.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaThis was a good movie and very underrated.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaWhere is arnold??
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaunderrated movie forsure! it&#39;s so good! 
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaway fucking better
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaway better than the shit of genesys
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaMaaaaaan trailer still gives me goosebumps. Love it. Pretty darn good movie.
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaway better thank genisys
-Czz-TcWCkAdelimeterByIshitaDe los mejores trailers que he visto. :)

miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaGreat film, but I thought it was needlessly dramatic in some places, like making Dolores Umbridge play an outright villain.

miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaI died laughing when i finally realized where i recognized the department head from... IT&#39;S PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE!!!!! THE TOAD STRIKES AGIAN!!! The actor seemed to be on a roll playing two bad teachers in one year. But damn is she good at it. Kudos on her acting ability.
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie. A must watch piece.
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaI understand that this is based off a true story and all but this is a cheap remake of Dangerous Minds that was released in 1995.
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaThat Goalcast vid brought me here. Imma watch this movie.
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaIs anyone else watching this because of the read 180 anchor video?
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaMy heart&#39;s always raising whenever they tried to speak and the teacher did really do a great job. I&#39;m crying and at the same time happy , the feeling that I can&#39;t explain , I felt in this movie
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaHello, Umbridge
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaHands down one of my favourite movies🙌🏾
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie it&#39;s really a good movie
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitau already know this movie is gonna be good if you doloras umbridge in it ( hp fans will get it )
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaGoal cast made me want to see this  <br><br>They did a piss poor job in the trailer of what it was all about. That’s the main reason I didn’t want to see it. Just another movie about gang violence and how no one gets out. <br>But this is about a teacher that inspired and the accomplishments of these kids. <br><br>Bad advertising mtv. Smh<br><br>Choosing Hillary as the teacher?  Her personality doesn’t seem to got. But ill leave my criticism of that after the watch.
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie to me was so boring
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie opened my eyes for sure
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaThis is so good

miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaI put this film in the same category as &#39;187&#39; and &#39;Dangerous Minds&#39;. All displayed &#39;urban youth&#39; in rough neighborhoods
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaUnderrated Movie ! A masterpiece !
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaDangerous mind 2 ,bad student learned good feeling created female teacher 🙄🙄🙄
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like a modern version of Stand and deliver
miz1V13QWsUdelimeterByIshitaBe the change!

jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s not the movie version that comes from kids storybook.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaslug bussiness. Thomas Elliott. mcdonald county media&#39;s. teachers.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThe animation of the movie my school has is TERRIBLE, AND I MEAN IT. Now I watch this trailer, I actually wanna watch it :)
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaLooks like I don&#39;t need to see the movie. They showed pretty much all of it in the commercial!<br><br>They&#39;d better not ruin it, I like, dedicated my life to this book. I was in a play about it, too, and I played Alexander. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitalooks cute
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaHahaha alligator hehehe I am gonna do that one I wanna live in the swamp or jungle I dont know mabye in the swamp I&#39;ve always<br>Wanted ro live out in the wild
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI think Alexander isn&#39;t going to fly away from home with a snowman just like the animated version
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen the original animated version of this movie.this one should be interesting
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaLooks cute.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaComes out on my birth day 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaComes out on my birth day 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitai remember the original book from my childhood
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaDear Disney: quit (expletive deleted: this is a &quot;family channel&quot;, supposedly) up perfectly good books / stories.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaRemember reading this book when I was little. Will watch the movie out of curiosity.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song from the trailer??
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaanother good movie to watch yay
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitathis looks awful. absolutely awful
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaare they making a movie out of every child&#39;s story.<br><br>I guess people in Hollywood cant read more that a 10 page book.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThe nostalgia of my childhood days .... 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaAhhhhh Troy!!!! 😍
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be a great movie! I can&#39;t wait!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaYayyy Steve carrel!! 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaUgh, my childhood is ruined. This is the most random group of actors put together combined with Disney&#39;s pun-filled &quot;family friendly&quot; garbage to ruin yet another lovely childhood book I&#39;M SO UPSET. I feel like this could have been done a lot better. :S
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF5JFoGIE5U&amp;t=2m06s">2:06</a> The word &quot;dope&quot; on a disney film.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOnce again, disney failing to depict teenagers. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaDid Disney just make a joke about one of their own movies? Low blow Disney
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitadid i just watch the whole movie?
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis comes out on my birthday  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blessed">#blessed</a>  
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaFinally, Disney.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOMG my friggin all tme favorite book!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaKinda liked how Alexander&#39;s entire family is having a bad day in the movie. I felt so bad for Alexander in the book because it was just him who was having a bad day and his family and friends provided like no comfort. Hope they make some references from the book
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaQue buenísimo, quiero verla pero la película &quot;Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&quot; llegara el 9 de octubre en Argentina :D
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Not Going to Beg for Viewers or Subscribers, I just want people to come watch my short video about my Ex-Girlfriend on my Channel. I&#39;d appreciate it, but if you&#39;re not going to watch, it&#39;s cool, have a great day.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita<br>Sb blende
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI remember this book! Awwww :)
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaTttrrewwQQQAASS
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOoooii
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaPp
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaHoly crud, now this looks good! I laughed pretty damn hard! I can&#39;t wait for this, a lot of good people seem to be in it...sweet!<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s go Wreck-It-Ralph!&quot;
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if they are going to put in parts from the other books in the series too.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI grew up on this book. Please don&#39;t ruin it. They already did with &quot;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.&quot;
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaSo loved the book when i was little.. Don&#39;t know about the movie though
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s going to be nothing like the book, but I think I&#39;m going to enjoy it.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaHopefully the movie will be a little less depressing than the book was.<br>Was that Jennifer Coolidge playing the driving instructor? My mom&#39;s gonna want to see this now, she loves her!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaPlease disney don&#39;t screw the book up. I grew up reading the book!!!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitalooking forward for another Disney Movie Looks Promising
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThe only good thing about this movie, might be that Stiffler&#39;s mom is in it. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaall these people saying its going to be bad because its not like the book when the book is extremely short so yes Disney tried to have a little fun with it I think its going to be great
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitanever cared much for the book, but I want to see this movie lol 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaA trailer by definition should nt reveal plot points towards the end of the film ...sighh
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI love it when my childhood books are torn apart by modern day movie producers!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaFuck this movie. It is completely missing the point of the book.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI think I just saw the whole movie in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF5JFoGIE5U&amp;t=2m38s">2:38</a> minutes.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaDYLAAAAAAAN
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI just found my childhood copy of this book! I&#39;m pretty sure that although I like most of the known actors in this film, I will NOT appreciate the modern twist on that slim kid&#39;s tale...
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis is interesting! I also LOL&#39;ed at the &quot;Nice going, Wreck-It-Ralph!&quot; part.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is that???
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaSeems like they showed the whole movie.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaDoes it even rain in the movie?! It better rain.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThose of you who are saying that the movie does not follow the book all that much are forgetting that the book had a flawed message.  Saying &quot;some people just have bad days&quot; makes less sense when most of the things that happen ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER&#39;S FAULT. Gum in his hair when he woke up? He went to sleep with gum in his mouth. Teacher liked someone else&#39;s drawing instead of his?  He didn&#39;t draw ANYTHING.  THIS movie strengthens the message by taking people who never had a bad day and having them learn how to deal with it with someone with experience.  I for one, have been interested in this since I saw the press release (which DOES mention the gum scene by the by, so they aren&#39;t ignoring the book completely) and this trailer just strengthens that interest.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaLove Steve Carell !!!!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis is a MUST to see! This looks like a great film. Can&#39;t wait to see It on my birthday.  :D
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaLOL! I thought this was an rated R film or at least some comedy PG-13 film. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI hope they don&#39;t mess this up, because this book was one of my favorites when I was a kid. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaXDXDXD
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaFirst minute I hated it, but I think everything past &quot;You all need a bad day to enjoy a good one&quot; won me over, I&#39;ve got to see this.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita&quot;Let&#39;s go, Wreck-It Ralph!&quot; DISNEY I HATE YOU SO MUCH I mean this movie does look like a good family movie but STILL
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaAs always, the book is better :P I wonder if he&#39;ll reference anything about moving to Australia or having gum in his hair, or not getting a toy from his cereal. Disney you had better not ruin this!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOh my god.......That&#39;s perfect! &quot;Let&#39;s go Wreck it Ralph!&quot; XDDDD
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI got to be honest, I thought I would expect Alexander as the only character that would experience every bad day in his life, according to the original book and the 1990 HBO special, but not his entirely family. :( Not sure if I like the way Disney apply to this change while including a kangaroo randomly hopping around in California. &gt;_&lt; 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis looks promising! I tried telling my sisters about it but they already went to bed. I have to wait til tomorrow then, but I really do want to see this!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita.....same song as Warm Bodies in the beginning.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOn MY BIRTHDAY. Yesh
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaWOW LOOK AT THIS GODLY, AMAZINGLY, SPECTACULARLY, FUCKING GOD AWFUL MOVIE.... NO!... NO!<br><br>This has nothing to do with the book what so ever, so in other words its a bad idea.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOH MY FUCKING SHIT CHILDISH GAMBINO IS IN THIS MOVIE OMG I WANNA SEE IT NOW HOLY SHIT YESSSS
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaHuh. I read this book when I was younger. This definitely looks like a promising film.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitawhat song is that at the end?
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaWreck it Ralph reference. Of course.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThat was surprising. I&#39;m diggin it.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI came here for bella and all i see is other people
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThe song at :49 to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF5JFoGIE5U&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> is Dawin Polanco - Just Girly Things! - you&#39;re welcome
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaWhat is a kangaroo doing in America???
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaA must see movie
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaSo, instead of being about Alexander himself. It&#39;s about the whole family. Yeah, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. I love the book because it&#39;s all about the one guy having a bad day while others were having great days. This...this doesn&#39;t make sense.
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF5JFoGIE5U&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> : Wreck it Ralph reference
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitawhat they replaced nick with a GIRL  what the fuck<br>!!!!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaone of my fav books is going be a movie yes ! this is the 4 the others were the wimpy kids
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitachildish gambino. 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOMG. I hope this turns out good. :)
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve just watched the entire movie soo.... not going to actually see it, so thanks I guess? 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaOMG trailer just came out today!? Gotta see this!!!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitathat was amazing 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitadude I used to love that book!
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m I the only one that finds it funny that Disney kinda promoted another one of their movies in this. I&#39;m talking about the teacher or principal calling him wreck it ralph 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThink we just saw the whole movie through the trailer lol
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaSong is Mountain Sound by Of Monsters and Men if anyone want to know :) just spent ages looking for it
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaThis was a book from my childhood but its look completely different- but quite good also
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m feeling very optimistic about this one 
jF5JFoGIE5UdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it has promise.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaOne of the few movies I own on dvd/blue ray. Didn’t realize it was 9 yrs old already
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitagood
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaLooks kinda boring just watching a person driving
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaMom loves Tom hardy
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsBDYAYnQb0&amp;t=0m47s">0:47</a> Tom Holland?
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaSpoiler…<br><br><br><br>He missed the birth.. So he missed the birth, Lost his job and his family lol
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaAll I have to say is wow!!! I just watched this and WOW!! I always knew Hardy was more than just an action star type of character, but man he showed his range in this movie in ways that will surprise anybody that think they know his on-screen ability.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy...great!
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaStick to the plan
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaThis deserves a sequel with Tom Hardy sitting on a toilet.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaOnly 35 comments? Seriously?
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaAmazing performance ; using one setting which is  a car seat but summoning up the whole hectic world ,is only Tom Hardy&#39;s accomplishment.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaone of those movies that the critics loved and the folks who actually watched it hated
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaI like Tom Hardy, this movie was trash, everyone praises it because it&#39;s &quot;artsy&quot; but it&#39;s basically a 90 minute movie about him driving to the hospital for his baby and his work calling him trying to get him to work on a project. The cop cars aren&#39;t even part of anything, they just are driving by in the movie. Just because it&#39;s a T.H. Movie doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good. Me and my friend literally started asking &quot;is he even going to get out of the car&quot; after 20 mins and then telling each other &quot;there&#39;s no way he&#39;s going to stay in his car the whole movie right?&quot;. We were wrong.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitai am pretty fuckin sure that A24 has the best movies
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaThis is a masterpiece as how it was set up.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaRyan Reynolds: Im gonna make a one man movie<br><br>Tom Hardy: Hold My Beer
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaХарди супер!  Привет всем
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaI am here to comment<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Spiderman &amp; Venom</b>
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaLooks like the entire movie is about work.
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy&#39;s A World Class Actor. . . .
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaTime, and time, again A24 get it right
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaSo, in this movie...Spider-Man is Venom&#39;s son?
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaI must say a solid movie
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaSet in one car with one actor, but it somehow manages to be an incredibly intense movie
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaMovie is trash. Don&#39;t waste your time and money
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been really looking forward to this for the past year roughly only to find out it won&#39;t be screening in my city. 
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaWhat is the release date of Locke in Belgium, please?
TsBDYAYnQb0delimeterByIshitaHmm...
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite horror movie of all times😍😍😍

CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshita🌹❤
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer actually sucks. The movie is one of the best horror movies of all time
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitawhat is the flashing in the distance when lynn looks out the window? right before bobby jumps in front of the window
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaIs this not based on a Scottish tale?
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI went to see this movie at the cinema and lots of people were just getting up and leaving halfway through. It is hands down the most twisted and f**ked up movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the most disturbing movies I’ve ever seen
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI’m a miner
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThat chick who had the baby with her, did you guys see them Big Tits Bounce outta that Bra when the mutant ripped off her Shirt, I had to pause it for a minute to admire them Big Tits.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitathe creatures here looks the same in the Wrong Turn
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMore and more I’m forgetting the past
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaStill one of my favorite trailers/movies of all time.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaSo they drop nuclear bombs near their home and they didn’t try to sue the government?
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWatching in 2019
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUQd9OB75dw&amp;t=1m09s">1:09</a> all of you are going to die poor fools

CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMore like wrong turn
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshita&quot;NO SEGNAL&quot; should he use IAM network to call 15 for help.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI watched this film when I was about 7 always used to turn it off cus it would scare me but it just came back to my memory
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaAnd it was this movie watching around 5 years of age that made me never drive through the deserts and it was wrong turn for forests! Life lessons you just never know what you’ll encounter.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI’ve always remembered this film. I really liked it. Want to watch it again soon.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThese creatures remind me kind of like the ones from wrong turn .
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThe hills have eyes part 2 - The Remix<br><br>Alyssa Edwards
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaBefore Hills have eyes. We have wrong turn.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies. Last day I buying this movie for blueray and play it on 4k.. Absolute perfection and that soundtrack &lt;3
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie so many times its so fucked up but great to watched
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaA slasher movie with a happy ending <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Amustwatch">#Amustwatch</a>
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitathis is a very hard watch ...but very good its on my top ten of horror movies
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWeres the one were the mexican guy exploded himself
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMeu filme preferido.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually one of the best horror movies I’ve seen. Defo up their with the best. It’s not jump scares like most horror movies- although it does have its fair share, but is mostly just pure tension and suspense. <br><br>If u r reading this- WATCH IT. Trust me, u won’t regret it.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWhat a movie it&#39;s super  horror and terror
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS REAL ITS CALLED THE BEAN CLQN
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaone of the worst trailers I have ever seen
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWhen the upbeat California dreaming track fades away into an unsettling silence. Instant chills!
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWatched it the most disgusting movie ever
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaGang gang, bean gang
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis was my first fap when I was a kid
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThe setting of this place gives me a strong Mad Max vibe.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie when I was 4 years old and I loved it for some reason.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaIts based on a true story
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaNever watched this whats the basic storyline of this film? Heard its scary trying to figure out if its worth watching or not lol.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!! The sequel was crap though.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI live in New Mexico ☹️😥
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks more like the chernobyl diaries than the hills have eyes.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaand the mountains have mouths a remake
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWhere I’m fromThe hills have eyes<br>The rivers have secrets an that’s no lie<br>The midnight train leaves a thick black smoke <br>The phantoms of hell chase that burning coal<br>Through cattle fields <br>Dead willow trees<br>Civil war coin and the soul so deep<br>2 huddled year old names carved deep in a tree<br>Prolly in another realm watching me...
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie was based on the name<br><br>Oh look the hills have eyes<br><br>Shouldn’t we call someone?<br><br>Nah it’s fine
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitathis movie goes from 10 to 100 in like 3 minutes haha
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaIs this disturbing I&#39;m 11 and heard it is can y&#39;all please give me advise
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMtdew firesticks aluminium and lightning crashes and thunder and chris cross applesauce and orange juice and firewater and dustbaths and venom and mondays. Crescent moons and shades and suns and bundles of bitches and glowing cornseeds and macaroni brains mellow mushrooms and jetskiis and yellow minions and organic jewels and mineral water no marshmellows. Last!
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely one of the best horror film I ever seen.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis is why I don&#39;t go on trips
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaNice✌️
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMy first thought when I saw this film was, if they have Buffalo bill they should have been fine. Rub the lotion on their skin otherwise they get the hose again
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWhat a terrible trailer.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best horror films made imo
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie when I was 4 or 5. I&#39;ve been trying to find for a while now.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI was watching a cop use those tire spike things and I remembered they used them in this movie..that&#39;s why I&#39;m here
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so disturbing

CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaAgent orange babies
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI miss this type of horror movies from back in the days. If only the movies from today were like this .
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaSo basically this movie is about stuff that radiation could do to your mind and body such as cannibalism,facial features,ect (tell me if I&#39;m wrong though)
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaNight Lovell?!
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaTHAT preview was approved for ALL audiences?! What kind of sick would let a young child see that- yet Hollywood says its perfectly fine.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaGood ass song for a great movie😍👌
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit what the fuck😂😂?!
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaUna de las mejores películas que he visto
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaDamn<br>Bethesda buffed the ghouls
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaFallout 6 looks great
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this, that&#39;s so scary with this crap.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies! If you&#39;re here trying to decide if you should watch it. Yes. Its worth it. Wouldn&#39;t say its scary. Just crazy as hell. Part 2 is good too. Havent seen the others
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWTH this not even scary the movie that always jump scares me is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23theconjuring">#theconjuring</a>
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most brutal movies you&#39;ll ever see... Shiver!!!
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI don’t understand what this is about
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s real story check out
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaWeirdmovie
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaYeah. A fantastic Movie
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t usually be scared of horror movies. I&#39;ve watched so many. But this. This fucking movie was so disgusting and horrifying. Every horror lover should watch this. Bc this movie doesn&#39;t have that normal &quot;paranormal&quot; cliche. Idk does my gender matter but as a girl it was even more horrifying bc those women in that movie got raped.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaFuck this shit im out
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaShould be vr.... and actors swarm around you... holy sh*t....
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this movie, it was not as scary as i thought but it definitely had some good moments. Of course, i found myself arguing against the character’s decisions, particularly their very first choice to change their route through the desert. But then again, i do that with every horror movie. It was a pretty gory film, not quite SAW level of gore but pretty close. The story was surprising as i went into the movie blind, and it got me thinking about whether people were actually affected by the USAF nuclear tests from the forties to sixties.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaMy friend said this movie is actually scary does anyone know if it is scary
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated horror film, it should be up there with Friday the 13th and Halloween.
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaIs this the movie where the bad guys  take a bird out of it&#39;s cage, rip the head off and drink it&#39;s blood?
CUQd9OB75dwdelimeterByIshitaThis is fucken disturbing
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitathat is equally as dumb. in jackie robinson&#39;s case it&#39;s not just the anachronistic nature of the music but in this case bragging about drug sales and escaping prosecution in a trailer about something that is uplifting to the black people&#39;s struggle.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitai understand it is marketing, bad marketing. do you think the young black population will go see this movie because there is a jay-z song in the trailer. is it that easy? i bet they will be seeing Gatsby too. my whole point is it doesn&#39;t fit, it&#39;s a cultural anachronism, it&#39;s distracting, and the line they put in is counterintuitive to the whole essence of the Jackie Robinson story. Not art, just slobbering tone deaf pandering to an assumed monolithic and ignorant demographic.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaJay Z&#39;s music is anacronistic to the era portrayed in the film, however.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaName of the first song please??
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaG.I. Joe - Retalation
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLa voy a ver
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaSafehouse
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaright? and i see people saying theyre gonna see it for ford...smh
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a great movie. Reminds me of the Cuba Gooding, Jr. movie MEN OF HONOR. I liked that film, and I got a feeling that I&#39;m gonna like this movie too.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI father, I Brooklyn Dodger them I Jack/ I Rob/ I sin, Ah man, I&#39;m Jackie Robinson cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitasafe house
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaNeeds to come out on Jackie Robinson  day on the 15 of April
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaexactly what i thought lmao 
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHow the fuck do they put rap to represent Jackie Robinson
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHarrison Ford as Branch Rickey? Awesome!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definitely checkin&#39; this out.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaCant wait for it to come out, lso cant believe the way things where back then......:(

I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait for this to come out

I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaJay Z is the movie trailer man this year. Gatsby, 42, Gangster Squad. Anything else?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI disagree
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitatarintino already stated in a video and he&#39;s right..where would it stop? would we only be able to use rap when we pinpoint the exact date rap music came about. people need to be more open minded and realize sometimes its just marketing and sometimes the director is being artistic like an artist...because film is art.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaJay-Z is doing songs for The Great Gatsby if you want to talk about inappropriate uses of Jay-Z in film
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaIf the reviews suggest it&#39;s good I might see it. But I don&#39;t think it will be up for any Oscars.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitacant wait!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshita Here is RapGenius explanation for that metaphor:

Jay-Z uses amazing word play about stealing &amp; sinning to come up with how he “is” Jackie Robinson. Except when he runs base (sells drugs like freebase cocaine vs. Jackie running around the bases), he dodges jail time (“the pen”…which is also a common baseball word, “pennant” “bull pen”)

Jay-Z raps along to the bass of the beat, he freestyles rather than writing raps  (dodging the pen or Microsoft Word)

For those keeping count: triple entendre
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaRAP IS RUINING OUR LIVES!!!!! SAVE OUR SOULS!!!!!!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitacool, extra or main part?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLove this!!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaTo Kill a Mockingbird&#39;s Baseball
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitamy friend is in this movie
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaIt does makes sense, if you are familiar with drug lingo. But, it definitely sounds inappropriate being attached to Jackie Robinson...
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaso true
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaPutting Jay-Z on the soundtrack for this movie would be like having Elvis do the soundtrack for Les Miserables: PRETTY FUCKING STUPID.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI am highly interested and I will be seeing in April.Thank you
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaSo I take it you don&#39;t like Moulin Rouge 
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLooks good
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaNo Oscars at all. It&#39;s like April release and it looks pretty mediocre.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaits a Brooklyn thing
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not coming out in December though...
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaNot annoying at all. I&#39;m tired of hip-hop &quot;adversity&quot; songs being thrown into serious films. I would love for this movie to get the acclaim I&#39;m believing it deserves and I don&#39;t need a hip-hop song to buy my vote to look at it or believe that I can relate. It&#39;s about Jackie Robinson. That&#39;s all you need to say.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThe movie looks great and its going to be a great Oscar contender and probably win an Oscar.When will this movie bee out in theater ?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaYeah me too I don&#39;t even know shit about it but still I think this movie will be a success.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaAlan Tudyk FTW duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!

I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be good period.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaSadly, movies like these usually get under credited for how good they are and/or over looked. 
Movie looks great to me though.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis film is the answer to life? Send me a message if you know what I mean
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s has been made.....in the 50&#39;s and was done by Robinson himself.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe this movie hadn&#39;t been made before.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitasadly this bullshit still continues in soccer euro cup especially. don&#39;t worry the taliban will know what to do with them.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaRemember him when he was jus&#39; a kid in the movie Ghosts Of Mississippi.  Didn&#39;t know he&#39;d still be around to do what he&#39;s doin&#39; now.

I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaAgreed, I think the metaphor is Dodgers dodging the Yankees.  As in he dodges the pinstripes I mean I know thats a reach but that&#39;s how I like to think of it.  Otherwise you&#39;re right it doesnt make sense at all not with the line before it.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitabrooklyn we go hard- jay-z
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaA trailer for a movie before a trailer for a movie......
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitadude looks like wesley snipes...
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitathis will be top 5 on my movie toplist
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI discovered this trailer yesterday. I think I&#39;ve watched it a dozen or so times now. Boy I can&#39;t wait. By the way 4/12 (release date) is my BDAY! lol
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitai love baseball
n i love this :)
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s name of the song beginning  at 1:50?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaGay
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI love seeing such an uplifting movie about one of the greatest civil rights icons and in the trailer they have Jay-Z rapping about being like jackie robinson &quot;except when I run base I dodge the pen.&quot; Besides the fact that the metaphor makes no sense, I&#39;m sick of modern rap being used in movies that take place long ago like Rick Ross in Django Unchained and Jay-Z in this trailer. It doesn&#39;t fit. It would be like the Bee Gees doing a disco soundtrack  for The Godfather. 
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaBrooklyn!!!!!!!!!  
4 2
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitathere is no film called that... but I did look the song up and it looks like it was in &quot;Notorious&quot;
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHarrison Ford has only made one bad movie in his career, so I don&#39;t think it is possible for him to fuck it up.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHate Baseball too, but like you I am going to watch with movie.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis could be direct competition to Lincoln.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshita&quot;24&quot; Kobe Bryant coming in a theathre near you 2083
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHis song actually goes with the movie &quot;Jackie Robinson&quot;
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshita Lucas Black
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaomg I almost didnt recognize Harrison Ford :O
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be there with my Jackie Robinson jersey on... the question is will I have a date...i guess not...for ever alone&gt;.&lt;
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis looks so good
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLooks good
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThe Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitahaha why is Jay-Z on every soundtrack now? lol
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThat shut him up at 1:52
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaOh great, Wash is a racist.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLooks great.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaholy shit. Alan Tudyk playing an unlikable character for the first time ever. seeing this might hurt :(
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitahow many goddamn jay-z songs do i have to listen to in movie trailers? i dont mind jay, but this always takes me right out of the trailer for some reason.  idk maybe it something about rap not really fitting in with this movie, and i&#39;m a  huge rap fan.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaOscar for best picture and Tommy Lee Jones looks like a lock for Best Supporting Actor also and Christopher Meloni is perfectly cast also in his role as Leo Durocher
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitathey should have just made a movie on the whole dodger team of that era with sandy koufax
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshita1:11 Billy Riggins
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI hope Harrison Ford doesn&#39;t fuck up such a great story. hearing Jay Z isn&#39;[t a good sign.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis will be gr8
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaThis is going to be great.

I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a black man, and I agree with you 100 %. This is a period piece and should be treated as such. I&#39;m guessing the hip hop is thrown in to attract the younger generation of all races to see the film but I really hope they stick to everything that was authentic it that time era in this movie. I hope the hip hop music is only in this trailer.   
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaCall me annoying, but it was so fucking typical for Hip Hop to start playing in this trailer. I hate when it&#39;s a period peace and they start playing modern music (hip hop) just because of a black main character. It feels like racial stereotyping. Maybe I&#39;m opening up a can of worms, but that&#39;s how it comes off to me.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaBaseball? Try all sports
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaGOOD FUCKING MOVIE. Cannot wait for this one!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitai dont really like baseball but the movie looks great
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaWow
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not much into baseball but this movie is gold can&#39;t wait to see it
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaOscar Bait.
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI dont even like baseball but my God this movie looks great!
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitait says 2012...
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaAh...they made Steve the Pirate a racist?
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaHistory will be made
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaLooks like a great film, can&#39;t wait to see it
I9RHqdZDCF0delimeterByIshitaI thought this came out like 3 years ago?

dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI know im missing the point of this but... what if ove got back to his young age as a cyborg with modern science... then made that chick lecturing him on life eat her words.  <br>Her: ahhhh maybe you should be alone, im done with life screw it.<br>Him: i shot your car to bits with my cyberblaster, so sorry,  you cant just give up :-).

dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaIm in tears and all i did was watch the trailer!
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaLoved it ! ❤❤
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI was a student in Sweden,gavle for 4 years and I had a friend named Mats  Blomqvist. Very kind man he was very funny too.  Swedish language is full of humor. Ove reminds me a lot of mats. we still keep in touch. Go sweden!  much love!
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI pictured the Ove just like it was shown in the movie. But Sonja, she should be more beautiful.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI just read the book,it&#39;s amazing.The movie looks nice too but Ove &#39;s girlfriend asked him to merry her ....it&#39;s different
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitawhat a fabulous film, i&#39;m the richer for seeing it.

dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of movie named Gran tarino or something
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m listening  to the audio book at the moment and really enjoying it, I hope to see the movie soon :)
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitanice film - very touching, mildly amusing, a little predictable.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitawhat
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaIt was weird for Ove to be put off because Rune likes Volvo instead of Saab, both of which are Swedish cars. Well, his reaction when Rune chose a German car... lol
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s not how I pictured Ove 😭
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI absolutely adored this movie.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaThe book (I&#39;m sorry) bored me so much that I couldn&#39;t get past the first few chapters. However,the movie looks really good.!
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaStrongly recommended.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitabeautiful and tragic, but totally lovely, uncomparing to this &quot;new romantic movies&quot; it crealy deserves more attention than it haves
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaThis one deserved the Oscar, not the Farhadi&#39;s movie. They politicize any shit.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was so amazing and I dont even watch foreign movies. I had a day off and gave this a chance at a local theater. So happy I did. Solid 9/10
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the music is at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPoaN2XROk8&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a>?
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitayes
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI just started reading this today and looked online for the actual paper book because I hate epubs and saw there&#39;s a movie. :D I will watch it after I read the book or else I&#39;ll never read the book. :D He&#39;s just as grumpy as I envisioned him! And funny! :D
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaJust watched it. Really awesome! Love the  music!
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitahoping this movie will be shown here in the philippines..
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaLooks like typical Swedish pro-immigration propaganda to me.
dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaI went to see this tonight in Austin Texas USA at the Arbor 8 and it was GREAT! Loved it!!! Thank-you Sweden and thank-you Ove!!!

dPoaN2XROk8delimeterByIshitaMy favorite book ever!  I really hope it comes to my town.  I have a bunch of people excited to go!  :)  This trailer made me cry.  I love Ove!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaBilly Crudup as Phil Zimbardo. Well done.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaprobably my only and favourite  psychology study ever. good choice in selecting actors, zimbardo looks exactly like how he is supposed to look like !
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaMaybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve never heard of this experiment or am involved in any psychology program, but I just randomly watched this movie in theaters and thought it was amazing. Very creepy, interesting, and it&#39;s definitely worth seeing.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaWow, thirty seconds in and this looks great... Why isn&#39;t this movie getting any marketing... I&#39;m a huge movie buff by the way.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaholy fuck. they even nailed the voices. scary fucking shitttt.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-07-29/#SPE-trailer">http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/15-07-29/#SPE-trailer</a><br>About this week’s eSkeptic<br><br>Are We All Potentially Evil? A new dramatic film based on the Stanford Prison Experiment reveals why good people turn bad. In this week’s eSkeptic, Michael Shermer discusses the film, the original experiment by Philip Zimbardo, and the triad of general principles behind evil posited by Zimbardo: the Person, the Situation, and the System.<br><br>This article was originally published on HuffingtonPost.com on July 27, 2015, and also on MoralArc.org today.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be fucked up.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaAs an experiment not the worst idea. as a MOVIE -_- ughhh you&#39;ll be lucky if 25% of Americans decide to see it. everybody knows how it ends, how it began, and what would be exaggerated or not. Hollywood needs to get its head out of hookers assholes, and start getting good ideas real soon because, people are already switching from going to the movies to streaming and other multiple choice of activities.mark my words. if they don&#39;t change and start making movies worth seeing again then movie theaters are going to be the next Blockbuster.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitathe Zimbardo expirament!!! very excited- especially because its been a while since Ezra&#39;s played a lead role :)
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaWow. This looks extremely interesting. I&#39;m not usually into this kind of stuff but I really want to watch this. It&#39;s crazy what power can do to someone. No wonder most cops are such pigs and get corrupt with power.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitahollywood likes to make craps of original movies from Europe... like Nikita..or in this case &quot;DAS EXPERIMENT&quot;...a German movie from few years ago...find original...not this shit
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaremake
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI wonder when is screening in Korea?
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitais this movie only playing in certain states? I cant find it playing in any theaters in ohio.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to watch this exact movie but with different actors just watch &quot;the experiment&quot; was made in 2010. Forest whitaker is in it.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast and story! Looking forward to seeing this.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaA survey that only examines privileged white male college students is dodgy as fuck Imo
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaGOSH DANG OLIVIA THIRBLY IS BEAUTIFUL!!!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaAw reminds me of my family growing up.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis and Milgram are what got me into the social sciences.  This is a must-see for me.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshita6/10
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI love Ezra Miller and Keir Gilchrist. Two of my favorite actors of my age group. Honestly though, i feel like i have seen this before with the German thriller Das Experiment based on the Standford Experiment. I hope that its as accurate as the book was based on the actual events. I wouldnt want them fudging things up just for the sake of awards. I&#39;ve seen some of the actual footage and ive read so many of the testimonials and reports. It better be good damnit.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis is like The Wave that happened in California in 1960-70s I believe 
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis seems similar to, The Experiment, starring Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker. However, I will say that I prefer an IFC movie over some of the mainstream production company&#39;s high budget movies. They use their industry to subliminally promote satanic agendas, including many animation based production companies. Thus far, IMO, IFC has produced quality, entertaining movies that are not terribly singed with satanic symbolisms and  plots. Though as with every goddamn thing else in media entertainment, it may be there, and I have missed it. Nonetheless I look forward to enjoying this release, which appears to be based on the actual event.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Thomas Blass&#39; excellent book, &quot;The Man who Shocked the World: the Life &amp; Legacy of Stanley Milgram&quot;. If anyone does not know who Stanley Milgram is or doesn&#39;t know about his controversial study and experiments on human behaviour, it will be an eye opener.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI was reading a book, Lucifer effect, written by the director of this experiment. The fact that this movie will open soon in theater, makes my skin crawl. Can&#39;t wait for the movie.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis is pretty much our abusive neglectful state of affairs with the current US judicial system accept that people have been purposefully killed and abused in our US prisons and jails and hardly anyone is ever held accountable.  If you just google prison deaths, or prisoner killed, abused you will come up with a f*** ton of hits to many many news articles of prisoners being tortured, abused, neglected and killed outright by guards.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI learned about the Zimbardo experiment in my AP psych class. That&#39;s scary how people can just start taking on other roles and how their mind can alternate
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI remembered how fucked up I thought the real experiment was when I learned about it in high school psychology. Watching this trailer really brings back those feelings, although this movie is dramatized for obvious reasons, the fucked up-ness of this experiment is reflected in this movie.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThere already is a German movie about that topic it&#39;s called &quot;Das Experiment&quot;. Let&#39;s just hope this move here is better and based more on the true story than the one I saw.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaEvery psych student is squealing
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it will be good. They&#39;ll overdramatize some aspects but it looks like it will do the experiment justice.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY !
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitahow many times can you remake the same fucking movie????   <b>facepalm</b>
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitayak another remake for that movie not sure that will be better than The Experiment
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThat Paczy person commenting about &quot;Das Experiment&quot; to several other commenters. You are not informing people about anything and Should seriously read up on the Stanford Prison experiment from 1971, where all movies similar to &quot;Das experiment&quot; and this movie have gathered inspiration. Google Paczy. Use it! 
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThe Experiment The movie The Experiment with Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker was already made, you&#39;re too late.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaAlready done. The experiment. Why watch a remake of a movie of a remake of real life 😔 that i can&#39;t simulate in my oculus, it&#39;s bullshit I tell you! 
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaMy psychology class brought me here
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaplease make it clear how shitty this psych experiment is
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaDas Experiment 2001<br>The Experiment 2010<br>and now this cmon we want something new the movie is not old enough to deserve a remake
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE AGAIN....Its been done  foreign and us....why another one...a story about a experiment ( really happened ) that went to hell...why you need to stuff it back again
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t there a film much like this one starring Adrian Brody and John Whittaker about like 5 years ago? i&#39;m curious to see how it turns out there. I&#39;m already anticipating Ezra Miller as the flash.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaFinally! after so many documentaries. It&#39;s a story that blown psychology away
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s important to point out that practically everything shown in the trailer is make believe (after the start of the &quot;experiment&quot;). No one was struck by a baton in the real experiment. Additionally, in the real experiment, the guards were actually encouraged to psychologically mistreat the prisoners - so that&#39;s exactly what happened. Emotional violence, NOT physical. Of course, that doesn&#39;t make for a good movie.<br><br>The SPE didn&#39;t demonstrate what the &quot;environment&quot; does to people, it demonstrated how pliable people are. But Milgram already demonstrated that; much more clearly, conclusively, and terrifyingly (imo).
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE IT&#39;S GONNA FUCK ME UP FOR DAYS I LOVE IT
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaSoooooo excited for this!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI just got the sickest chills I have been waiting for this forever
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitalooks good, but remake of &quot;Das Experiment&quot;
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie ripping off The Experiment from Paul Scheuring??? It&#39;s like the exact same plot!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaHey look it&#39;s the flash
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaIn real life,  the psychologist ask in marriage the girl and she said yes.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaso it&#39;s basically a remake of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0997152/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0997152/</a> but with a different (since the original film was inspired by true events even if the characters and ending were different)?
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaSo happy that the trailer got released today, been waiting ages for this. 
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI bet every psych student is eagerly looking forward to this movie! Can&#39;t wait! :D
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t that Forrest Whittaker movie already do this?
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaSo that&#39;s what Dr. Manhattan meant when he said he was &quot;going to another galaxy&quot;... That sadistic little shit.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaZimbardo is a disgrace to the field of Psychology. He pretends to be a wise man that somehow wanted to learn something from sadistic role playing with no precautions. He played the role of the warden in the real experiment, thus allowing the guards to be sadistic pricks. Oh, by the way, Zimbardo likes to fuck his female students.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis has to be the dumbest shit i&#39;ve ever seen.....Ezra Miller sucks balls too
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaummm hasn&#39;t this movie been made? The Experiment 2001; with Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker. That was a great movie. Hopefully this one has more to offer than the same story line.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaDas Experiment better then this shit
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitai just had a psychology exam and this was part of the question.and to be honest. the trailer is enough to get what is going on if youve already studied this. BUT that doesent mean i wont watch it! its gonna be good ^_^
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI dont mind a remake of a remake of a remake of a film, only as long as the actual remake surpasses the original, or takes a completely fresh look at it from a contemporary/cultural view.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t this exactly show whats wrong with prison?
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaJust an OTHER FUCKIN REMAKE shit
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis is all over the place in Sociology/Psychology departments. It&#39;s really not that dramatic. I am interested to see Ezra Miller, being he&#39;s our future-Flash and all.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis has already been done (The experiment)
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThey already made this... its not that great of a premise
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis looks sweet!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t they already make this movie
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshita...and then when you get out, you destroy those pussies? lol
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaTht guy looks too young to be the flash.  
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t the teachers just stop it?
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaPsych majors unite! I am so excited for this.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaNow we need a film about the Mouse Utopia Experiment by John Calhoun, It would be done by Pixar, like Ratatouille but with sex and drugs.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaeehhmm... its a remake basically. Whats the drill here? nothing exciting realy..
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaWTF this is like 3rd time somebody made a movie about this event, and everyone goes crazy? Mediocre.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaMost of the commenters here are such idiots, this isn&#39;t a remake of The Experiment or Das Experiment, those movie were fiction inspired by this real life study that took place IN AMERICA in the 1970s, this movie is a bio pic of The Stanford Prison Experiment those films ripped off of. This is HISTORY not a crappy suspense thriller.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaHi Ki Hong!
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awful.  No one was <b>ever</b> physically assaulted during this experiment.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer forever... No like i&#39;ve been waiting for at least a year like I am so happy
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI like the diversity in the study. Prisoners and guards all white. Totes real life.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis movie pretty much already exists it&#39;s called &quot;The Experiment&quot; 
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitathere making Zimbardos study a movie! i cant wait to watch this and show my psychology teachers! damn Ezra Millers performance alone.. i cant wait
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaLooks like somebody has finally made a good movie about this experiment.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaReminds of a psychological study I studied during my A-Levels. It was a banned BBC study based on Zimbardo&#39;s original findings (a study by Reicher and Haslam), but wow this looks great... Maybe it will finally shed light on what went terribly wrong. I wonder how factually accurate it is though...
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaAs a psych major, MY INNER GEEK IS FREEAKING OUT
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaMoi &gt;3😍😱
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaLol learned about this in psychology class. Can&#39;t wait for the movie !
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI imagine the Honest Trailer would be like &quot;Based on that one and only case study you remember for your Psychology exam&quot;
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Das Experiment only more american and unoriginal.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThis looks INSANE.<br><br>And it&#39;s far more likely to scare me than any horror movie would.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitai was there! i still have the original footage! j/k i&#39;m seventeen, i like pickles
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I have been waiting for this movie forever, I&#39;m so looking forward to see Ezra Miller
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI would be really excited for this one if they havent done it yet (Das Experiment and it remakes The Experiment).
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaezra dad
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaWhere can people watch this movie? It already came out, but I haven&#39;t seen it anywhere...
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaThat one guy really does look like Phil Zombardo... so looking forward to this.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaInteresting looking film.
7LviGTHud5wdelimeterByIshitaI love the premise of this movie, and the fact that it&#39;s based on true events makes it even better. It could just be a brilliant movie to keep an eye out for!
Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitalooks like Place Beyond The Pines for badasses
Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t really know what to think about the movie yet,but:
THAT CAST!!!!
I&#39;m kind off disappointed btw that between all the batmans and Batemans, I haven&#39;t seen Borden yet,which is my favourite Bale role.But I think he pulls off any role way to good to end up just being Bateman or batman.
Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitaEPIC!!!!
Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitaSo basically it&#39;s Snatch but in America and not funny?
Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitawhat song is this?

Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitaRelease is my fav Pearl Jam song so far and fits perfectly with the theme that this movie is supposed to have. Sounds like nostalgic somehow. Not to mention, this movie stars Christian Bale.
I&#39;m going to check this movie out for sure.

Gw0qH34cbREdelimeterByIshitaAhhh, so that&#39;s what happened to Bruce Wayne. I see he has let himself go.

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitais this going to be longer
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitathe first movie was bad but this movie kinda looks promising.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThe animation still looks bad
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaYay !!
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaRoderick is gonna make Christmas extra fun
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaAnyone else distracted by the fact that none of the mouth movements line up with the dialogue?

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitamade by the newly accepted employees at the walk disney studios.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaCan’t wait for all those people to cry “nOt mY rOdRiCk!!!”
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaWay to destroy the legacy of Devon Bostick Rodrick.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaokay everyone, lets get the not my Rodrick hashtag rocking again
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThis means that Greg is an extremely skilled artist who can draw himself, his friends and his family perfectly

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaNot my rodrick
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThey should leave it alone
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaIt seems cute but the animation still needs improvement
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaI know that a lot of people didn’t like the first one but I loved the first movie so much.Can’t wait to watch this next movie KEEP up the great work disney!!!

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaOMG
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThis just seems like it&#39;s all the scenes from the book and 2011 movie together in an incoherent messy way.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaRodrick is a fan favorite
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaRodrick: This sequel is mine!
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThis is going to be bad like the last one

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaIt has potential
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaWhy you cannot upload this video to the 20th Century Studios channel?

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaLet’s hope this is longer then the first movie
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaWhy is the house at the beginning of this trailer looks like Mike Wheeler&#39;s house from Stranger Things?
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaWow! How quick did they make this film! It feels like it’s hardly bin a while since the first! This film looks SO good!! 🤩
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaY

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitathe first one in 2021 was the worst Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie ever made (other than The Long Haul but we can all agree that that didn&#39;t happen) so I&#39;m just not exited for this one. <br><br>plus, what&#39;s the point? why dont they make one for Cabin Fever or Getaway or some of the new ones that we haven&#39;t seen.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaLive action version was still better
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaI’m not gonna lie I was obsessed with the books when I was younger. It’s cool they’re making another movie about it 😅
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaOh man here we go again and this time with a twist
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaThe first one wasn’t too great but I&#39;m excited to see what this is all about
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaShould&#39;ve brought back Devon.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitalemme guess, since it&#39;s Disney, they&#39;re going to make the mom twerk -_- great. life is great.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaTf... the animation is so dull 😑
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshita😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaWould anyone here mind giving me any mountain bike parts? I want to construct a bicycle. Any component of a mountain bike can be useful.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaFinally dropped it can&#39;t wait to see this one!
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaHappiest Halloween to everyone in advance 🎃
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaHere it comes.

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited! I loved the first one!
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaYay!😊
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaUm yikes….. the animation here looks like it’s from a PC game or a animated game on a website and the lip syncing here isn’t right. I have a feeling this is gonna either be better or worse than the first movie.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitareally enjoyed the last film! excited for this
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaTHERE BACK WITH A SEQUEL!!

16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaHere we go again
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaI work at a library in Chicago and when I receive any LGBTQ Children&#39;s Books I&#39;ll instantly throw them in the Dumpster out back and also take a select few home to roast in my oven so the plastic melts. I then breathe in the fumes and feel like a viking warrior sailing the north pacific. I havnt been caught doing this at my job yet and probably never will.
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitafinally something exciting 😍🔥
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaOk
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitaOk
16u7oeK0O90delimeterByIshitafirstt
_TDYhTNpUzodelimeterByIshitaWhy is the scene where they dance in the trailer not in the movie? ☹
_TDYhTNpUzodelimeterByIshitaVery good trailer. 😂
_TDYhTNpUzodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TDYhTNpUzo&amp;t=0m14s">0:14</a>: Worse. UN-dead.
_TDYhTNpUzodelimeterByIshitaTurns 10 today!<br>Even being dead we need some warmth from each other <br>Had no idea this was based on Issac Marion&#39;s young-adult novel <br>A new spin of &#39;Romeo &amp; Juliet&#39; by director Jonathan Levine unexpectedly as a revitalized, optimistic take on the play <br>Palmer and Hoult are the central core of the story beginning an unexpected romance between the living and the dead <br>&#39;R&#39; in particular is adorable to watch only able to communicate through limited speech and we hear more of his internal dialogue <br>The premise is a smidge corny and some stuff plot wise is skimpy but there&#39;s a likability to these two saving mankind in the most unexpected way <br>It also still gives horror lovers some pulse-quickening spooks and paranormal comedy enthusiasts plenty to cackle about <br>A big departure from the typical zombie fare we are used to but it remains subversive rewriting the genre itself giving a self-aware edge making lots of inverses <br>Few stories like this exist on a particular romance of this kind yet it&#39;s refreshing to see from the undead POV<br>The author Marion got himself out of a deep depression thanks to the source material feeling much like &#39;R&#39; being isolated <br>The movie also asks what makes being human a human being while also delivering a great message of offering hope among the bleakest of circumstances <br>People want to try to be better and we have to learn to suck it up, it&#39;s hard to accept change, is not feeling anything better to avoid feeling altogether?, maybe learning to live and reconnect is the cure <br>If you think about it there&#39;s even a real world parallel of a wall built to keep the bad people out and the normal ones safe <br>For all the Twilight haters rest assured the romance isn&#39;t shoved in your face like a lot of YA adaptations <br>&#39;Warm Bodies&#39; tells us how to be human again through commentary on consumerism, narcissism, and xenophobia <br>It&#39;s good to take a second look at fear <br>Who says a rotting corpse can&#39;t have a conscience?<br>What else can I say; this movie works as both a zombie tale and a modern romance
_TDYhTNpUzodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hit">#Hit</a> Zombie movie

KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitabest performace of all time
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaThis movie completely convinced that Cate Blanchett is one of the greatest actresses of this time.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaGreat performances and great story - some of the writing was a bit odd....like how Jasmine had to measure the feet of some of her girlfriends while working retail...but why would a grown woman need her feet measured? You know your shoe size......Woody Allen is an absolute creep and the typical jazz music throughout is nauseating.....Cate&#39;s performance is insanely good, her character comes to life! All the supporting actors are amazing too...
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is just a masterpiece. All of it. The whole cast. Woody Allen’s script…. And Cate Blanchett - she’s just… I don’t even have words. Perfection.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaI was very impressed with Bobby Cannavale as Ginger&#39;s boy friend, a marvelous performance.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaWoody Allen is a master of his art.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaCate Blanchett is just … well … there are words!
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaShe made some quick choices: Can you put the FBI on the phone? God: Say goodbye to the Upper East Side, Jeannette.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaBlue Jasmine is just the tip of the iceberg.
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaCate just fantastisk 👍просто великолепна🌿
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaGorgeous :) 
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitalast music trailer?
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaCate Blanchett - she just never sucks
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaI was thinking the exact same thing!! :)
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaHickory dickory dock. AUUOOOOO
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitaI just saw A Street Car Named Desire and this looks pretty much the same?
KK7_xLxf4o0delimeterByIshitastreetcar named desire update?
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaShin godzilla is anime?
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaBest Godzilla movie ever. The way it shows how people and the government would actually react to something as catastrophically destructive as Gojira is amazingly realistic and believable. The overall feels is just so tense and keeps us over the edge of our seat. 10/10 easy. Better than any of the USA ones. No disrespect intended though, the American movies are great, it&#39;s just...this one&#39;s better.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI love the starting trailer song and go ji ras roar
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI cried in fucking terror for most of the movie, and I don&#39;t cry over movies ever. This movie is something else. Pure terror of destruction. I don&#39;t even like Kaiju stuff. Hideaki Anno is a genius.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitalooks like they didn&#39;t even put effort into the trailer also the movie 🙃
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI personally love the Monsterverse (except Godzilla vs Kong) but this is a masterpiece, 100.000 times better
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitalol this is my favorite godzilla movie
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaMilitary: <b>Shoots Shin Godzilla Intensely</b><br><br>Shin Godzilla: <b>Destroys the City More</b><br><br>Citizens: THAT JUST MADE IT WORSE!
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaSome people keep forgetting Godzilla is a Japanese franchises. They&#39;re not making a &#39;Japanese Adaptation&#39; of it.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaToho can really make the most realistic Godzilla
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitathe best part about this trailer, it gives barley shin godzilla forms away
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI love movie so much
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaYou can feel the tension even from just watching the trailer :0
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaabsolute great movie
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie and soundtrack, p.s. this trailer gives nothing away, love it!!
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitai dont like it
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaGuys, what is the name of the track that starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qX1ZU3jcfU&amp;t=0m18s">0:18</a>?
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaque mierda es esto diclaik reportao
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of this song?
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaGojira
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI have seen this
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie name match to shin Chan name
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve GOT to rewatch this
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaall I love is THE song
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaKya chutiya trailer hai 😀
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI already watch the full movie and i like it
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaIt seems to be more about a country dealing with a natural disaster than about Godzilla himself. It looks grounded and realistic. For some reason I feel a lot more interested now. How good is the cgi though...  Might break the immersion if it’s not really good.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie later in 2019 for Americans was renamed Godzilla returns (its was a terrible idea shin godzilla sounds fine)
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaD-DOSTUM! KENDİMİ NÜKLEER BİR FACİAYA ÇEVİRDİM! B-BU ÇOK HAVALI!
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThe True Gojira
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaLol
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaAre they running from colossul titans form shingeki no kyojin
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThis version looks like if Anno did coke, weed, and LSD all at once the night he first watched 2014&#39;s <i>Godzilla</i>
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaGod damn i always keep comming back to watch this trailer. The presentation is amazing. No need of a fancy dialogue followed up by some loud bass noises, some action scenes and a joke scene at the end.<br><br>The creative team behind the edit were amazing.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitawhy this wasn&#39;t released worldwide is something I would never understand
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThis is like the nier automata of the Godzilla movies
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaEnding theme beat hits hard
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaImagine Kong facing off against all of Godzilla&#39;s past movie enemies, and just getting tossed around like a been bag by some. But then completely destroyed by Gamera, Shin Godzilla, Mecha Godzilla, Ghidora, n the rest of the top dogs.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaAnd then.. Kamen Rider will be touch        next on

3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is way better than the godawful western (Monsterverse) reboot and its sequels.<br>Godzilla vs Kong felt like a Marvel movie instead of a Kaiju film.

3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaYes this is my favorit trailer ✅
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaMan this movie was Gold for me
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaSome people will not understand this film since they didn&#39;t understand what Godzilla was originally. <br>Gojira is a titan of terror. A chaos and a destroyer.<br>I like the way they made it a hero in later films of Toho<br>But the original Gojira is seriously the best one<br>Shin Godzilla had the spirit of original but with Lovecraftian themes<br>They made it again a destroyer and a total disaster<br><br>This trailer is great! It reminds me of Alien 1979 trailer where there&#39;s no dialogue only the classic siren music which Prometheus 2012 trailer did too<br><br>Though this gave Godzilla scenes unlike the latter two trailers which showed no glimpse of the antagonist<br>This still great!<br>You can imagine all the things happening by yourself while waiting for the film!
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaPlease make a Shin Godzilla 2!!!<br>I really am looking forward to that.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI love how the trailer feels very old-timey, hearkens back to the old Godzilla movies.

3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for the sequal to hit cinemas. Went and saw this with my friends and it was so damn good.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaHow a Godzilla movie is supposed to be done.
3qX1ZU3jcfUdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s about time they take back a staple to their culture and do it right

zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitasiempre que veo este trailer o la película.. acabo llorando a mares... es la única peli romántica que me encanta...  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23INeedMyDexter">#INeedMyDexter</a>  :)
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the title of the piano music that plays at the beginning of the trailer, when Emma says &quot;When we were at university I had a crush on you&quot;?  It&#39;s not the Rachel Portman score.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaShe dies right?
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching this movie. My heart is broken :/
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t cried for 2 years... I&#39;m just not one for emotions... however i just cried for half an hour straight and now have puffy bloodshot eyes. I will not be watching this again. Ive used up all my emotions for the year, and its only march. So sad. So beautify. So real.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaWhen she says go to hell in the restaurant in the film she really says go fuck yourself.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI loved the Book and this movie brought it to life! Just seen it again after being aired on Ch4! I&#39;m gonna have a little cry now lol 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s strange &amp; wonderful how your life can be entwined with someone else&#39;s no matter what you do or where you go!!!
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t seen it yet, but it sure sounds like a clone of Alan Alda&#39;s &quot;Same Time Next Year&quot; (a wonderful film)
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI cried and it&#39;s just even an innocent trailer. Why can&#39;t people just realize who is worth apprecited when they still have the chance?
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI remembered  I finished the whole book from start to the end in one flight from Edinburgh to Rome. Then I watched the movie. I felt such a sense of loss at the end. One of my favorite movies of all time. 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitacry-cry-cry
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaIM FREAKINNG OUT I READ THE BOOK AND ITS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES BUT I DIDN&#39;T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A MOVIE OH MY GO D 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaque canción es ?? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVuuooZqVaU&amp;t=0m09s">0:09</a> ??
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaIf i have to say the truth, i have to say that i hated it... because i loved it too much! I know this doesn&#39;t make much sense but this feeling of sadness i have right now won&#39;t leave for quite a while, and that makes me hate it, among with cruelty life shows in this movie... but i also love it. Really, deeply, truly love it. Its my favorite movie now, even when i&#39;m still crying.<br>im sorry if this comment is confusing, i really cant understand myself what i really wanted to say, it&#39;s just that i&#39;m writing this just after the movie finished and i have mixed feelings....<br>ps: the trailer is shit! this movie&#39;s beauty doesn&#39;t even compare to what this trailer shows.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitai just watched the movie and im still crying, what a wonderfull story, im upset they didn&#39;t fall in love earlier
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaWtf man.. This movie killed me<br>
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI cry like a baby.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaThey forget to mention that this is NOT a &quot;happy end movie &quot;.. She gets hit by a bus in the end -_-
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitathis movie really crush my heart 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaMy dear friend.. I miss you so much.. Every time I watch this I think of us..
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaHeartbreaking
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaits so beautiful 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitathis movie killed me omg. I cried for an hour straight.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s on my channel 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitatruly touching and beautiful movie. watched it again and cried again :&#39;( 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI read the book. This is so beautiful. :)
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s make me cry soo badly 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaOtra más a mi lista de favoritas...
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI was watching this in my room, with all the lights turned off, on my bed, lying down... then suddenly my dad came and looked at me... he was shocked... &lt;don&#39;t know why!!!&gt; I was bit worried... but he asked, &quot;Did you just wake up?&quot; &lt;ahahahaa....&gt; I thought that he would make fun of me... that I cried... psshh.... JUST wanna say... this movie is goood... really good... about true love!!! every time I look at Dexter my tears would fall... felt sorry for him for being too lonely, getting old without Emma!!! I don&#39;t really like sad movies where I would cry because it makes me fall in love with a character who is lonely!!! &lt;doesn&#39;t make sense huh!!!&gt;
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so sad and upsetting but it&#39;s perfect :( 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI dunno I normally like Anne Hathaway but in this I feel that her accent just doesn&#39;t work, and I really really think she suits long hair x
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaI have a feeling that if I watch this im just gonna be distracted by Anne&#39;s bad accent...
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaBest romantic movie ever. I was crying so hard at the end.
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaNot a big fan of romantic movies but I really like this one. And it&#39;s such a sad one! 
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitadont read the comments there&#39;s a spoiler
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the first time that the movie is better than a trailer... 3
zVuuooZqVaUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Those who can Do and Those who cant Teach&#39;&#39; that&#39;s how I feel about my art teacher

T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaWish i could wish it&#39;s never happened.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaLiterally the only good thing about this trailer (and the movie) is the music. But not even Two Steps From Hell can make up for all the mistakes. And there are many.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawhýyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitai saw this movie illegally at home and after watching it i feel like someone owes me money
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it that the dragon ball z movie title because you make this movie came out very poorly. I love comic dragon ball, but I hate this movie.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaWORST - HORRIBLE MOVIE EVER!!!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaDid they even read the source material?
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie straight up ruined my childhood lol 
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaIf you are or were a Dragonball (Z) fan, I wouldn&#39;t recommend watching this movie. Things such at the KAME house where Master Roshi lives were such a let-down... I mean, he is supposed to live on a tropical island in the middle of an ocean! Not in some lame city. That&#39;s one of many dissapointments to me in this movie. The characters didn&#39;t even look like themselves either.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThis was so poor..... the worst bit was when he ruined the Kamehameha, ruining an entire childhood in about 5 seconds.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaNow... That doesn&#39;t do anything with creative
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaBulma can suck on my dragon balls
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitait looks nothing like the original wich makes me mad plus bulma looks nothing like that. and where the hell is mr. po po, kami, gohan, krilian, vegeta, napa, seriously think it out more. 
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitathis angers me!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita72 people know that this crap ass movie is FTL.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaI thought Goku wuz a kid in db.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaONE WORD. FANTASTIC!

T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaYet another anime they ruin, poor dragon ball and Avatar the last airbender -.-
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S NOT A REALL DRAGONBALL !!! this looks so awefull... iiiyyy... Maybe i just read the manga and watch anime than whatch this kind of .... thing
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitalame.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is wrong with you people it&#39;s such an awesome movie!!!... I love it!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaDONT WATCH IT! it sucks!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaEPIC FAIL =_= in many ways.....
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawhat a waste of time
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita@x00004 ???
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitathe only reason I watched this is because of jamie chung. Overall the movie does suck, but I did enjoy some of the scenes.

Dragonball is not impossible to make into a live action film. They just need the proper crew to film it.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitathe movie is awsome all you hatters can suck on it you probably are gay anyways        cuzz there are some awsome chicks in the movie nice effects and just because its not so like you expected to be doesnt mean it sux       
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaWhy goku looks so weak in this movie? :))
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitahahha it looks worst that i expected but i think if someone havent seen the dragonball cartoon and see this movie......he will say &quot;good movie&quot;
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita@rvm4u seriously dude 6 months ago...6 months ago, i need not say anymore...if you have time to read a comment from 6 months ago you must be some kind of social cripple...i have the right to express my opinion stop crying like a little bitch in my inbox...
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita@darklord1345 BULLSHIT IN THE CARTOON HE HAS A COLOR IN THE MOVIE HE SHOULD OF STAYED THE SAME COLOR
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita@CuriousPedestrian I KNO RIGHT AND IM BLACK, WTF THEY SCREWED THE FUCKING MOVIE UP
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawho ever made this fucked up movie needs to be cute to piece. piece of shit. THIS IS NOT DRAGON BALL PPL!!!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThey should&#39;ve added... &quot;Not based on the ACTUAL Dragonball franchise... we just liked the names.&quot;
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawoah this movie was awesome we an a friend watched it drunk and we never had such a good laugh before =D....Sure disappointing as a DragonBall Fan..but still you can have a pretty good time watchin this bunch of crap...I mean if you´re not a hardcore DB fanboy :P
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaawful...... maybe if they had changed the name and changed the dragonballs....to &quot;mystical devices&quot; it would had had a shot
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaxDDD
who the hell directed this??!!!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThats right dude i&#39;m single i&#39;m a little virgin..oh i&#39;ve never even held a girls hand..*tear*...ha dude get real this is the 21st century...my girlfriend would kick the shit out of you...your guna have to do better than the &quot;oh, get a life and a girlfirend, because that&#39;s what everyone says to me so i&#39;m going to say it to you&quot; comment...tip, it makes you sound like you have less of a life dude...i feel sorry for you
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaNothing, absolutely nothing like dragon ball. Why even use the dragon ball franchise for this? Just call it another martial arts movie.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaDBZ is Lame anyway...i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll get some negative replys but i actually don&#39;t care...bring it this show sucks...
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitalol a lot of haters about this movie
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitathis is heart-breaking.
:&#39;(
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell guns and vehicles. that completely changes the setting of dbz
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThe action is good, but the storyline is almost as bad as street fighter the legend of chun lee.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so crappy! I had to stop halfway through the trailer; I couldn&#39;t bear to watch any more.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaDragonball would have been a better idea to turn into an animated movie. Not that it should have had a film to begin with.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshita1:02 LOL a transformers!!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaI thought that the DBZ saga was safe.......BUT HOLLYWOOD FUCKS UP EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR TO OUR HEARTS!! DAMN THEM!!! GODDAMN THEM ALL TO HELL!!!!
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaoooo man i watched this movei and i loveed it it is best movie ever 


not this movie sucks more dick than richard simons
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitayou couldn&#39;t pay me to watch this dumb  movie.
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitalol wow this looks terrible
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitaWhy is Goku white?
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitait could have been so good....
T4_wHfz2qUAdelimeterByIshitathis movie will suck
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest movies of all time.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaIn Desert Storm, we painted Wolverines on all the tanks we zapped.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaInteresting to see some scenes that didn&#39;t make it do the final cut
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaKey words she said &quot;They&#39;re coming for you&quot; because you&#39;ve dona a great job filling in your profile on these social aps, they know who&#39;s most likely to cause trouble for them... perhaps another example of art imitating life...😮😂
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaBad movie, bad acting and bad scenario in american way what would be...
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaIdole
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita&quot;No foreign army has ever invaded american soil&quot;<br>Britishnuggets: 🙂
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaummm in answer to the opening credits,  the British in 1812 sacked Washington.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaHow about this for an idea? A re release in theaters. It would be a way easy sell-already made an paid for-only cost is the digital distribution (and residuals for any actors who negotiated as such.) It would be hugely popular-except, of course, in Russia. ;)
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaAmerican partizans.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaPutlers wet dream
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaWOLVERINES!  such a guilty pleasure movie!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaЧто я щас увидел?!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaThis could be real life soon at this point. People freaking out about UFOs, I think other countries are testing out our territory. Never vote away guns. You&#39;ll never know when you&#39;ll need them.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita🤔
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaSo, it happened, kinda...
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaChina thinking of doing the same thing. That why they looking at every  military base in the United States.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaI feel this is a preppers I told you so moment.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here because of those China balloons🎈.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaChina is the new Soviet Union now, Russia lost that title years ago. Now, we are on the verge of being invaded by the Chinese all because of Biden.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaoh my christ!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaBlk Guys Dies 1st....Again
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaFunny yet they disguised themselves as commercial airlines but wouldn&#39;t someone get a little suspicious on why 400 Aeroflot planes are requesting to land at LAX that are not scheduled? And can&#39;t carry tanks on any commercial plane lol but great movie !
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaIf they made this based on Gen Z all the teenagers would immediately join the communists and set about accusing their older family members of being counter revolutionary.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaThey need to make one with China evading America with the use of TikTok.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaHahaha 😂😂😂
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaIf only we realised it would come from the teachers, and not enemy paratroopers
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaliterally Ukraine the past 6+ months
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Zelenskyy when you need him?! 😡😅
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaPurin thinks he lives in red dawn
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaTheseasonorg explains the whole bible God bless
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaAbsolute classic!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaFun fact, The Soviet soldiers and officers are wearing parade uniforms not  actual combat uniforms.
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaCall of Duty John Robert Bruffett Junior 🇺🇸 pilots
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaThis didn&#39;t age well
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaTurns out we didn’t need to be so afraid of these incompetent jerkoffs
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaRed Dawn was filmed in Las Vegas, New Mexico!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaRed dawn 2012
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaMilius may have been a Faux Conservative but he knew how to make movies that sold....
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe they made a live action remake in Ukraine. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel in Taiwan...
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaHistory repeats itself
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaThis is what you get when you bully the Russian kid at school
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaIf you didn&#39;t already know, this was the first ever movie to be given a PG-13 rating. All because of Spielberg&#39;s crazy mind that gave us the PG rated Gremlins and Indiana Jones
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaA brand new slate like Ellis Island
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita, ultimately from Old English noun ceap &quot;traffic,
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaJohn Milius amen!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaAwesomeness job
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJMZapC8NQ&amp;t=1m57s">1:57</a>
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita<b>ROSOMAKHY!</b><br>🇵🇭🇺🇸🇺🇦
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshita<b>WOLVERINES!</b>
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaI still want to see an extended, director, or final cut. WOLVERINES!
HZJMZapC8NQdelimeterByIshitaTOP CAST 😎👍

mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshita@ASCowns My god parents aren&#39;t a couple.  One is my mom&#39;s sister and the other is my dad&#39;s brother.  The church had no problems with that. 

People can also set up a will to chose where their children get to go. If one isn&#39;t set up, I believe the children get sent to the next of kin or to the state, depending on the situation.  
mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshita@girlatwork28, i think he says why dont we meet at 10.30? something like that?
mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshitai thought this was the book

mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshitaKatherine Heigl! do something different! all her roles are the same!
mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know where you can buy the tiger pillow at 1:44?

They have a bad first date, then they get custody of a kid because the parents died. They have a hard time feeding the kid. They&#39;re going through struggles, but then they find love. I know the whole story and I haven&#39;t even seen the movie.

mqzjDrrZIdEdelimeterByIshita2nd? :S
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshita28 lifes later
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThe jabbed are the infected, the thick gullible waisters, dont feel sorry for them as they would happily be your jailor
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaImagine 28 years later-<br>Thats wild-
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaBro the second outbreak could be avoided like in a million ways
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThe best horror zombie ever in history ! Honestly everyone l&#39;m rewatch 28 weeks later 30 time believe me even fast zombies are the most terrified more than like resident evil franchise and the walking dead franchise series ! IF you watch it this movie first time every one day you&#39;ll realize the storyline was totally like video call left 4 dead 2 !
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaI hate the kids
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThe thing about part 2, is as adorable as that brother and sister are, they&#39;re the ones responsible for the second initial break out of the virus (cause they didn&#39;t stay put as told), and they&#39;re responsible for spreading it yet again across the channel, when the helicopter dude flew them to safety.<br>Adorable sure doesn&#39;t mean harmless, that&#39;s for sure.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitathe siblings were too stupid in this movie. they restarted the rage. they risked many lives for their selfish reasons!
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThey are making a new one ppl !
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie I have watch it already 5 times
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaDanny Boyle and Cillian Murphy said there working on sequel called 28 Months later!
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaFirst movie so much better
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshita28 Days Later SUCKED. Poor quality, poor plot, poor character development, poor acting. Wasn’t scary, wasn’t interesting, wasn’t worth the $3.99 to rent. Not sure Id want to see the sequel but it definitely looked better in the trailer
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaIncredibly stupid movie.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaSadly not as good as the original film 28 days later .
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaStill good movie for 2022, and i got dizzy. It will do better if you had atleast a steady hand camera man. 😵‍💫
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaFuck this
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaMan I love this movie sequel. The first one is so fantastically cinematically made too. Danny Boyle is such an excellent movie director. The cast and crew, the setting, and the theme is so suspenseful of action. You will be thrown out of your seat. I wonder when is the next or the 3rd sequel? Please can&#39;t wait to see the continuation. A 5 <b>***</b> Star. Best suspense thriller award 👌
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaIf the dad was American he could&#39;ve fought off those zombies.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaSpoiled by how quickly he gets from attacking his wife in the lab to getting out and killing guards.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaIf you can make it thru the first 10 minutes with out getting sick  from the camera movement you are a hero in my book....you need fucken Dramamine pills to watch it,,,great job you did Juan Carlos Fresnadillo ......sorry Jeremy Renner but I couldn&#39;t watch it
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the most shocking, disturbing,  violent movies I have ever seen in my life
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaAll because of 2 dumb ass kids that had to cross the bridge AFTER being told not to! Everyone died except them like wtf. Hate movies like this
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThey should make a 28 seconds later movie and just go on from the rage monkey scene
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitacool movie🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThee best zombie movie EVER!! The storyline, the acting, to the end, DOPE!
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaMy fav film. Not properly in Covid period 🙄
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThe Most Beautiful film ever.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaFast zombies suck.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaWhen conspiracy becomes truth we should all be afraid
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaIts been 15 years since we had this movie. And there&#39;s STILL isn&#39;t a third movie to resolve the cliffhanger this ended on.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshita2.8 years later
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThis added some good points to the common zombie lore: they’d have to move fast to infect so many so quickly. Zombies who shuffle along like…well, zombies aren’t as credible.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaStupid ass movie.🤬
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThis was the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitabest trailer made
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaThey need to turn this into an video game sequel
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshita<b>28 days/weeks later:</b><br>- fast infected (faster than the humans)<br>- aggressive infected (you will probably lose in 1v1)<br>- takes few seconds before the virus takes over the control of your body<br><b>results:</b><br>A city survives<br><br><b>The Walking Dead:</b><br>- slow af infected (you don&#39;t even need to run to escape)<br>- weak af infected (bro, Rick literally survived 1v3)<br>- takes hours for the virus to take over the control of your body (possible amputation)<br><b>results:</b><br>Citizens gone, government gone, military gone, only few survivors remain alive<br><br>Fair enough
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaPetition for 28 months later plz
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshita6 months after the virus was successfully wiped out and London slowly returns to normal, a small mistake puts the people again to fight those unstoppable undead.
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaJust like Left 4 Dead
ljqY7qrnycwdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaok, it started slow but the trailer got really good!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaNot today satan.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it ... why doesn&#39;t he just use his magical powers to fix it?
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t know harry was a descendant of some demon, no wonder voldemort was after him.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m afraid it&#39;s all down hill from here Harry
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaDaniel is horny.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaVoldemort like this!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks preety cool.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitalooks great, he may outgrow harry potter yet xD
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaOh geez Daniel,  what happened to the little innocent roles you used to play? I think he is going to end up like Selena Gomez or Amanda Bynes. Start off as one of those really loveable actors, then try to grow up too fast and  become that one actor that no one will remeber five years from now.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThat didn&#39;t even sound like him, holy crap. That American accent though. 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaTHAT WAS SICK!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWhat rating is this?
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s Daniel Radcliffe I thought he was called Harry, I&#39;m so confused... Are wizards actually real?

B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re the Devil, Harry
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaBut....this is a joke though, right?...right? 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWow, Dan&#39;s American accent is pretty spot on! Almost didn&#39;t recognise him. 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaFrom warlock to devil hmmm
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaweird

B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitalooks campy and its hard not to notice his accent because everyone knows its fake at this point
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaactually looks good
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaHarry is a goat :D
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaoh silly Harry.. didnt snape already taught how to get into a persons mind... oh wait
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWaking up horny? That&#39;s just a typical morning glory for me...
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaAs strange as this movie looks, I think I&#39;m going to see it...
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaTo watch this , you need to be drunk , like no joke.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaOh! what&#39;s  happened with Harry
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaAnybody follow? 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThe teaser kinda sucked for this, but this trailer made it look so good. I cant wait to see it 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks soooooo good! Different, thrilling and hilarious. And even though I&#39;m a huge Harry potter fan, dan is such a good actor, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even relate him to it in this! And I love the accent on him :D I can&#39;t wait to see this actually 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaHarry being the devil and shit
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaSo Harry Potter revealed his real identity and finally gave in to Slytherin.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitawow this movie looks <b>horny</b> lol

B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaintredasting, looks ight
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m already a demon..
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaAmericans in films try to do an english accent and it doesn&#39;t work...unless you&#39;re renee zell&#39; in bridget zones. We brits can ace that USA accent!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this sooo bad!!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaSounds like he&#39;s trying too hard for the accent, makes his voice sound cartoony, if that makes any sense. 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaSo... What is this about?
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s been sniffing way too much Magic. 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaSometimes I wake up Horny too...
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaOOOHHH
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s some next level illuminati shit right here :D

B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitateh fuk harry? something went wrong with Polyjuice Potion?
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitahe looks alittle to horny for me,, :P
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThis concept is way better than a dick becoming a person.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWTF is this shit?
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshita:(
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so creative and amazing. Usually sloppy romance&#39;s aren&#39;t my type, but I&#39;m definitively watching this one!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t like him with an american accent :-(
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaYeezus xxxst <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Harryisthedevil">#Harryisthedevil</a>.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitahe can still talk to snakes??? hahaha 
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD DANIEL&#39;S AMERICAN ACCENT IS SO FREAKIN&#39; SEXY!!!!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaHarry, wat. What spell did you mess up this time. kidding. THIS MOVIE LOOKS PROMISING!
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaActually looks dark and funny, and this might be Daniel best performance.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be interesting, although really awkward seeing him in his american accent.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaI LOVED THIS BOOK
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s his scar and wand? He&#39;s a wizard.
B8s_1UcdoNIdelimeterByIshitaWhaaaaaaaaaa !

ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m kinda sad Logan didn&#39;t make the Spider-Man movie
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaStill think he should have been the new Spidey
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaCharlie finally made it to collage!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting to say the least
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is ..... First 30sec 😍😏..And then 🤔😤😰
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaNow where is Sam and Patrick?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else think it was Fox Mulder on the thumbnail?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitasexual repression and cultural disaffection? never heard that from movies before. this is going to be interesting
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSo... is he a killer? Is that what he thought he did...?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI get it, he&#39;s a closeted gay or a communist.  Ether way, it&#39;s a death sentence back in the 50&#39;s.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitais this supposed to be ted hughes and sylvia plath
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitacome on girls let&#39;s not deny that we&#39;re all here for Logan Lerman
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaExcellent trailer ❤ Logan Lerman is perfect !
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaOkay now, What are you up to Percy Jackson?!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI hope he plays Tim Drake in Batman
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s Tim Drake/Robin, right there, where he will be appearing in this movie before the Ben Affleck/Batman film
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer that doesn&#39;t show the entire movie. Nice!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaEvery time that I see this actor think that he should be a Marvel super hero
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaInteresting..I Think..guess I need to watch it!!! And oh my does Logan look beautiful :)
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWas that ben rosenfield i saw?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSomebody want to tell me what this is about, please.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSomewhat resembles the movie School Ties (1992) starred by Matt Damon and Brendan Fraser :)
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitahe is so damn handsome!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco will time travel back and get his girlfriend - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELKsrUssyQE&amp;t=11h22m63s">11:22:63</a> lol
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaaaaaaah logan 😍😍😍 I miss him😍😍😍 can&#39;t wait to see him in this movie
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait until it comes out!!!!!!!!!!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThat punch was kinda funny
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused what is this about
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI take it she&#39;s yandere?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaNever been a fan of Logan but he was incredible in Fury with Brad Pitt, this film looks good!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWhooooo LOGAN is back
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWhat u doing Percy go kick some Minotaur ass
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI watch everything with Sarah Gadon. She is such a good and uderrated actress.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan Lerman looks like a young Paul Rudd.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLow key ship it
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitawhat?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaAbout time. I liked him in perks of being a wallflower
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitareally loved the make of this trailer. it revealed parts of it but still not too much so it makes you wanna watch the film to find out
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaIs every book a best selling novel?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSo basically I think this movie is about a introvert young male with unstable issues meeting another unstable young femwle that enhances his unstability and I think he&#39;s reflecting on it throughout the movie with that first guy we see
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitai didn&#39;t understand what the movie is about, yet i seem to prefer this kind of trailers than the ones that give away the entire plot.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWow this looks interesting
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThree decent movie trailers in a row? Wow, trailer editors getting better and better.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThe story 8 years before 11.22.63 :D
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan Lerman, you sexy beast.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshita&quot;In 1951, Marcus, a working-class Jewish student from New Jersey, attends a small Ohio college, where he struggles with sexual repression and cultural disaffection, amid the ongoing Korean War.&quot; This 1 line in the description told me more about the movie than the entire 2 min trailer.... I&#39;m definitely not for trailers spoiling the entire plot but I didn&#39;t get anything from this trailer.... this is the other end of the spectrum.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI NEED to see this
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitarobot woman voice at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELKsrUssyQE&amp;t=1m32s">1:32</a>
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaJames where you at?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t tell if I like this or not.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan lerman 😍
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitagood trailer
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaboring
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really excited about this movie. plus I needed a new with Logan in it. I feel like he&#39;s such a underated actor,. BUT HES AMAZING
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThe perks of being a wall flower 2
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaAaron Taylor Johnson lookalike.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaperks of being a wallflower is one of my favorite movie because of him
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaNice.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSaw this at the Berlin Film Festival. Quite good, there is one scene that really stands out and is a good example of quality film  making
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t know what this movie is about
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWHY DID HE HAVE TO KISS THE GIRL T-T
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan is phenomenal!! 😍😍
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaWut?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitafemale destroy everything, he was a bright student and then comes then gf, his IQ goes boom.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitadude showed major acting skills in Perks of Being a Wallflower and Fury. Quite a bankable actor
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaPhilip Roth is a fuckin genius. Love all his works. This movie must be watched with any doubt.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaisit me or did he look alot like a young johnny depp in the thumbnail?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitanerd turning into a psycostalkerkiller... I think I heard this before.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaJust finished watching this trailer and I still know nothing about this movie
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThe new Percy Jackson movie looks good
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan is so gorgeous!!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s gonna be the next Tobey Maguire/Elijah Wood. Underused because eternal baby-face.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI was waiting for so long for this trailer!! Greets from Greece :)
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaGone Girl the prequel?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThat trailer music though...
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaHe was amazing in Perks of Being A Wallflower, literally my favorite movie ever. Saw him in &quot;Fury&quot;, and his performance impressed me! Can&#39;t wait for this though :D
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaGot it. He doesn&#39;t wanna follow any one religion and that he is bi. More in Trailer #2 I suppose.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI love how the lack of detail in the trailer creates this sense of intrigue and immense curiosity. It&#39;s rare where I&#39;m captivated by a trailer and I&#39;m willing to actually watch the movie. The typical trailer reveals far too much, it reveals the climax. This was perfect, it leaves the viewer wishing for a second part of the trailer. It leaves the viewer in suspense. Brilliant trailer.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLooks very good.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaGod&#39;s not dead
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaAnd thus a new star was born. Kudos Logan Lerman.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitamy boy Logan back at it!
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitawhat is this movie about?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitafinally... a new Logan Lerman movie :D
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaThe young dude from the movie fury?
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI really dont know how I feel about this trailer
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogannnnnnnn
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaLogan Lerman needs to get more work, surprisingly good actor
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll show this movie to my son when it&#39;s his bedtime
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaFor a second I thought this was going to be yet another Divergent sequel. Thank god.
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSarah Gadon!!! &lt;3
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaSomeones pissed he didn&#39;t get to be spiderman
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitalogan gettin cute year by year T.T
ELKsrUssyQEdelimeterByIshitaI waiting for James Franco to show up
