Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitataken 1 and 2 has different directors, i guess this is gonna be good
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaand where&#39;s our beloved Jasmine Trinca between the final actors&#39; list?? :)
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaMan Sean is looking bad. I mean not that he ever looked good. But great actor
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI know it said this was based on a book, but this goes for all future action films.<br><br>you don&#39;t need a wife/daughter/son/family member to in danger/kidnapped in every film to &quot;add emotion&quot;. it&#39;s a cliche and it&#39;s getting old, every time I see a new action film where the hero&#39;s loved one is in danger it drags down the film for me.<br><br>the only action film in recent memory that did this well is Taken.<br><br>I wish more films would ditch this cliche, it&#39;s not needed.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitagood cast!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sick of trailers like this. gave away the entire plot from beginning to end. no reason for me to go see this movie now
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like great fun even though it&#39;s nothing new :)
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSo anti-gun hypocrite Sean Penn plays pretend with firearms on the big screen but fights against the average American to have one for personal defense?  A Liberal hypocrite... yeah that sounds about right.    
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaamericans and their guns 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaDamn. Old people be going senile and shooting everyone these past 5 years. lmao Liam Neeson look what you have wrought.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be bad, you&#39;ll see.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaMy philosophy: If you are Gay, don&#39;t play tough guy.<br><br>The only thing I like in the movie is the Glock with a 33 round mag.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaPenn was a bad choice for this role
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaBuy it
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn in a gun movie, Pot calling the kettle black..
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaIm so happy Sean Penn is in something like this where hes just a bad ass. Since Mystic River Ive been waiting for him to play a part where hes taking names and shit. Im in.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI love how the only thing good in this movie is javier bardem and sean penn to but idk this movie looks predictable
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSo Taken but no Liam.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaGil Scott-Heron! 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThat cast!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s always a book !!..once again, it&#39;s all been done before by Hollywood. I&#39;ve said it before many times...if you want originality, go to Spain, Sweden, France and S.E. Asia...America hasn&#39;t got a clue anymore.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSick! Love the cast. Sean Penn is awesome
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t we seen this movie like a million times before, only with different actors and a different title? And why does Sean Penn look sooo god damn bad? He looks like someone in his early 70s. Wrinkly bastard.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaBeyond The Trailer you should do a Review on this trailer. Sean Penn Jumping into the helm of an Action film where he is kicking Ass, this trailer looks impressive &amp; has a great cast of actors!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWon&#39;t lie Gil Scott-Heron made the end of this trailer pretty epic :) 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaNot as over the top as i hoped. 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThe movie may seem cliched but it definitely has lots of potential.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaNo.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song in the trailer?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn?  Who the f*ck wants to watch that ass-clown in an action movie? Seriously, the hypocrite should just fade away, just another narcissistic liberal progressive with his hand out!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThe highlight of the movie was The BMW M4
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhy does Sean penn feel so miscast to me, I&#39;m feeling Gerard butler, matt Damon or a list of other leading men, Sean is such a good character actor, (assassination of Richard Nixon, I am Sam) it&#39;s almost like this is too easy or beneath him but I suppose i can&#39;t judge based on a trailer, anyone else get that feeling though?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean penn is awsomeeeee
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaHas a formula of been there done that already. The trailer shows the whole film. 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaso let me guess he&#39;s a private military contractor doing some dirty works in 3rd world country and he save everything they done in diary&#39;s and the company kidnap his girl to kill him? no i didnt read the video description hahaha 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaBasically we just saw the movie lol.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn, Javier Bardem and Idris Elba. Damn, I hope they&#39;re not wasting all that talent on a stupid action flick. This better be on the same level as Taken.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaBank Gothic, ugh... you know the movie&#39;s going to suck whenever they use that font.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI like that Sean Penn makes more action movies. Gangster Squad already wasn&#39;t a typical Sean Penn movie, now this. I am excited.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThe main character looks ordinary. He doesn&#39;t have the cool factor that Taken or The Equalizer has.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSo i guess Pierce declined to star in a reebot of the Matador.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaMight as well name it: TESTOSTERONE - THE MOVIE
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaPierre Morrel can make entertaining movies his best quality is that he shows the actions and minimal shaky cam and quick cuts.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitalooks very promising....i can&#39;t say no to a Taken-clone...<br>however Lian Neeson is totally &#39;mamias&#39;, can Sean Penn be another one???
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song at the endish of the trailer. 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaAnother Expendables?  Didn&#39;t we just have one?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaAnd Peter Franzen!!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaBadass!!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with this director... Always have to do with kidnapping woman&#39;s in his movies.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaspoilers....my eyes my EYESSS....stopppppppp...ahhhhhh!!!!!!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaTHE GUNMAN 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaTake my money.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaA Taken spin-off movie?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaJavier Bardem...? Idris Elba...?! SEAN PENN?!?!? Count me in! I don&#39;t care what movie it is - that&#39;s how you cast a movie!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist: This is Neeson&#39;s brother from Taken.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI hate when people try to troll on YouTube...<br><br><br>Read more (12 lines)﻿
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitashe was ... taken.. in the preview
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitathe cast is badass
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaIdris Elba !
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI love Javier Bardem and Ray Winstone! Sean Penn, meh...
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaCool hole movie is in this trailer. Great! 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaFinally, I get to see the trailer for this movie. Looks good and has a trio of great actors in it.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn is what I imagine Jeremy Renner to look like in ten years.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaAnother gun movie made by some of the most anti gun, anti 2nd amendment liberals Hollywood has to offer! These are the same idiots that will do interviews and freely talk about how bad and dangerous guns are, and yet they&#39;ve no problem making huge bank with guns. Fu%kin hypocrites...﻿
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshita<b>watches the first 2 thirds of the trailer</b> &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still skeptical.&quot; <b>Sees Idris Elba</b> &quot;SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!&quot;
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaA Metric Ton of Badasses in this film!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaThe wife/girlfriend kidnapping is so cliché
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitadid i just watch the entire movie?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaOh this looks good and it has some good people.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome...Sean Penn never disappoint
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks awesome but I hope I didn&#39;t watch the whole movie. ._.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaMAN this looks awesome
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait! Sean Penn is my favorite actor.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaAlthough this looks awesome, I&#39;m wondering what else they are going to show in the actual movie?
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI love this!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny cause the whole time I was watching the trailer I was getting a Taken vibe with Sean Penn being an older fella like Liam Neeson and what do you know, it&#39;s from the director of Taken.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve seen the whole movie through this trailer :/
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean penn. Thinks guns should be banned, makes huge money from movies about guns.wanker.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn in an action movie... well, that&#39;s not good
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaJavier Bardem will be the only reason to see this.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson would have done it better.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaOne of those trailers that insists on showing you the whole movie. Great..............
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitataken syndrome, but I&#39;m watching it. It&#39;s Sean Penn after all
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn in action again...all my money.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaits like any action movie these days right when someone wants to quit what they do, someone they love is taken and they have to get back into what they do to save the person
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitathe song Gil Scott Heron - Me And The Devil..... You welcome!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaanother typical action movie
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaHe looks 50 and she looks 30 not a great combination. 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, Sean Penn kickin ass!!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaJohn Wincester :D
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI really like movie trends of 2014 and 2015 a lot, some ex-something with amazing skills go kill everyone messing with them. John Wick, Equalizer, November man, can&#39;t wait for this.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaI look forward to Sean Penn but I feel like, watching this trailer, everything&#39;s been done before.
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, but man, Sean Penn is getting old...
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhy do trailers insist on showing us the entire plot of the movie these days... 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitalooks good ill def check this movie out 👍
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitaWhy doesn&#39;t Sean Penn make movies about environmentalists or socialist saving the world or even just their own GF? Because they are boring stories just like his political commentary, boring. 
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshitalook good!!!!!!
Ug9xufczPVEdelimeterByIshita<br>1st

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaWow! They removed the black couple from the poster, but kept them in the trailer for views. Shame on universal studios. The black couple made the entire movie funny.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie didnt maked me laugh but it was good.

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI was not expecting to see Carlos Ponce from Julie and The Phantoms there... I mean, he don&#39;t look bad.

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the worst comedies I’ve ever seen. I came to watch the trailer because I couldn’t remember why I rented this.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so bad, I usually like average movies but this movie was just plain bad, it had nothing good and some things in the trailer didn&#39;t even happen in the movie.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaNice Video clip! Sorry for butting in, I would love your opinion. Have you thought about - Millawdon Varied Nights Trick (google it)? It is a smashing one off product for learning intimate questions to make your relationship stronger minus the hard work.

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaNice Video! Apologies for the intrusion, I am interested in your opinion. Have you ever tried - Millawdon Varied Nights Trick (erm, check it on google should be there)? It is an awesome one off product for learning intimate questions to make your relationship stronger minus the hard work. Ive heard some super things about it and my buddy at very last got amazing success with it.

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitawhy the movies are getting worse by the day?
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaJason bateman and jon faver should be ashamed. Vince vaughan this is his speed
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaWow the tot of this guy brushing his manhood to all this starving wives I wonder how they can look straight faced. Funny movie but yet there is underlying message..
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaNot the best comedy ever, but the acst is amazing.

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaEncouragement 😂
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshita1 of my fav movie it will be nice to see a second part
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie, while okay, could&#39;ve been much better in the hands of a better director. Especially with that cast. What a wasted opportunity. If they were to get this cast with, say, Judd Apatow or Mike Judge or even Edgar Wright, if they offered him more money, this movie would&#39;ve been wild!
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitahello readers<br>I am a writer<br>I want to sell a movie script<br>For a Hollywood movie<br>This is my address<br>Hastin Nuraini<br>Jalan Lilin Mas 6 Dadaprejo Batu East Java<br>phone: 6281334887683<br>If you are interested in coming and taking pictures in Java and Bali, I will help you<br>Thank you
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI will show you how to transfer the energy....boom.........boom... LOL
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaAllow me to put something more proper, then comes back with literally the same thing lol
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaWatching it again at home while it&#39;s on t.v.. Seems like there are parts that annoyed me before, but even more so now, like Vince Vaughn&#39;s character acting like a baby over the &quot;shark attack&quot;, or the fact that even for a 20 year old, the younger girl seemed like a brat! Enjoyable movie, though. I must be getting older when I&#39;d prefer the couple&#39;s section of that paradise retreat, as opposed to the other side. Then again, I&#39;d say I always would&#39;ve preferred that scene/section.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaIs the scene where jon faveru cheats on his wife actually in the movie
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaen sabth nur
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitathe funny thing about vince vaughn is how all of his movies are just incredibly average. like, he&#39;s never in any great movies and he&#39;s never been in any necessarily bad movies, every movie he&#39;s ever in just hovers right between good and bad. if you ever feel like just watching a very average and mediocre movie, just watch any vince vaughn movies, he&#39;s like pretty much the definition of average
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4j_NTFos9c&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> my high school gets featured lol that&#39;s cause Vince Vaughn used to live in Buffalo Grove
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI get they want to gather all the regular comedy guys they use in hollywood but these hot women with these average looking guys is just plain unrealistic. That ruins the fun more for me.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaCharlet what are you doing you have kids to raise and a husband
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaCarlos Ponce😍😂😂😂😌💪

X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis is such rubbish😖!!
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI just watched it- I liked it :)
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think the trailer does it justice it&#39;s an great movie!
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitasounds pretty funny
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaOwww thats mr. Chow
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve seen this movie or not...
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song toward the ending
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes me laugh every time I watch it I mean you have Vaughn, Bateman the guy who plays Mr.Chow from the hang over movies and Jean Reno couldn&#39;t asked for a better cast.
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually pretty hilarious! I&#39;ve watched it a couple of times and it never gets boring! 
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaoh my gosh, I was absolutely forgot about his movie !!!
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitaMovie is really bad
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitamr. chao from hangover as mariage counselor:))) funny irony
X4j_NTFos9cdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s max from hollywood heights
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThe best hulk&#39;s movie.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitafucked thing is we&#39;ll probably never get another hulk movie personally I thought hulk in both avengers movies was shit CGI made him look to cartoony did anyone notice how good he looked in the incredible hulk he looked so real same with the abomination and when they cracked on it was fuckin intense not like the avengers movies where theres not really a worthy Foe for him that hulk buster armour fight was fuckin bullshit hulk cannot be knocked out by a weak ass robot Period
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathis movie is underrated! <br>Too bad, no future hulk films were announced!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI remember when they shot this in Hamilton. On. back in 2007
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqNb2PFKKA&amp;t=1m46s">1:46</a> that roar sound awesome, should have used it in the movie
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton es un excelente actor, tengo que ver esa pelicula.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaIs it important to watch this when going through all the MCU movies? Cause he has only one movie and I could just go to Thor right away.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThe movie wasn&#39;t that bad, it was in the early phase of the MCU where they experimented a bit with what they could do and what pleases the audience.... I just don&#39;t like how they neglected/ignored this one in the following Marvel movies..... I was a bit dissapointed where the character went in Age of Ultron.......... Weird continuity. Sadly, there isn&#39;t another Hulk stand alone movie planned :/
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathis hulk looks more menacing than the avenger&#39;s shitty hulk
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita19910
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaBruce you player why you cheat on Betty? 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaMeh
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI like Mark Rufallo, but i am pretty disappointed that Edward Norton continue his role as The Hulk, I really like the shaggy hair of Ed Nortons Hulk
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get me wrong, this seems like a great movie, but Mark Mark Ruffalo (for me) best suits the role of the Hulk. He has much more of an innocent look than Edward.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhy dr Samson human in this he isn&#39;t superhero giant I use know with long green and super human strength 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who prefers Mark Ruffalo? :l
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaAle ta dziewczyna Hulka se napakowała botoxu w górną warge :&#39;D
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWorst trailer ever
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaBest Hulk movie XD Edward had the best Hulk.. <br>Hulk in The Avengers is a little bitch XD
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaGeneral Ross (William Hurt) will return for Captain America: Civil War. I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE HIM RETURN.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaHulk vs Iron man Veronica.. 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaAaaaaaanndd, they just gave away the entire movie in the trailer. Fail
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitalmao &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and &quot;The Big Slice&quot;  @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqNb2PFKKA&amp;t=1m46s">1:46</a>!!!!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie feels so detached from the rest of the MCU
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaNo lie, this hulk is sick. <br>What a shame tho!... 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI must say, the second trailer for this movie was much more spectacular and epic compared to this one.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitadamn this Hulk was crazy!<br>they should have used this Hulk in The Avengers!<br>and Edward Norton!<br>Mark Ruffelo always seems to look so tired like he hasn&#39;t slept in weeks.<br>en like he just got out of bed.<br>wtf 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEd Norton is a great actor but this movie sucked
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWait, why did they change the actor?
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t know you but i really liked this movie
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand how hulk won... Abomination has the super-soldier serum, the hulk serum and is a trained soldier, there&#39;s no way hulk could&#39;ve won.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaLol dat nortan guy kindof looks like wil gram 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathis hulk sucks the 2003 eric bana movie that was perfect.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaed norton has the voice of a dorky prepubescent kid.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhere Can I Sign Up!!😏
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaNOTHING BEATS HULK NOT EVEN THE FALCON PUNCH!!!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton the best hulk forever ever.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI love edward Norton too. Mark rufallo sucks. This hulk is way better.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis Movie out in 2008 but 2013 have the trailer.Jesus cry
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThere is iron man in the movie :-)
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaOnece I saw the green arm I was like omg
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaIT&quot;S PHILL FROM MODERN FAMILY!! :D
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaMore bullshit.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaah sweet toronto
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaTo me this was the best mcu movie they need to do another hulk 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s your favourite actor for Hulk?
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitai loved this movie when i was like 11
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhy they replaced Edward instead of Mark Buffalo . Edward is best coolest hulk ever made
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gives everything away
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton is my favorite Hulk &lt;3 I wish if he played Hulk in the Avengers, that would be spectacular !
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitabest hulk ever
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaGreat mov💵💵💵
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaCool! :D
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaMuch better than the first one. 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita..HOw..How.. Come i&#39;ve never seen this? WHAT HAVE I MISSED
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThe Hulk has badass strength, but he&#39;s still my least favorite Avenger :( :( :( :( 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaLove you Liv Tyle!! :S
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaCompared to Jennifer Connelly, Liv Tyler is not at all convincing as a brilliant genetics scientist. The end of every sentence she speaks goes up in volume like there&#39;s a question mark or she herself is realizing that she spoke. She is an airhead. She doesn&#39;t feel like she&#39;s living the character of Betty. Jennifer does. And then, William Hurt replacing Sam Elliot was... pathetic.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie Edward Norton was brilliant! 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita10 out of 10 the hulk is the best out of the comics. Make most hulks movies it will be 2015 soon come on marvel without hulk be no marvel
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaDemons - Imagine Dragons best song for hulk &lt;3
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitait a slug beat them up  CGI fest
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaIMO this is the best of all MCU movies.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhy the fuck did they make a reboot movie 5 years after?! And the original was better 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathey are making another hulk movie 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s PHIL DUNPHY!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton was  a better Hulk than Rufallo.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathe most underrated MCU movie
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis was way more fierce looking than Mark Ruffallo&#39;s Hulk in Avengers. How was Edward Norton not even considered?? &gt;_&gt;
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaHULK SMASH!!!!!!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWould have liked this version instead, he looks like an actual monster which is what the hulk is instead of the one in avengers.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaGreat film, I just wish Mark Ruffalo could have played Bruce - he was the director&#39;s first choice, but Mark had other projects to do or something :(
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita03 Hulk was a way better movie better story better actors better action!
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton is the best hulk character 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis one was the one in the avengers in the credits u see tony talking to the captain dude who tried to keeel hulk
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis was the actual hulk...then the avengers hulk tbh..
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitawhen is this movie coming out
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaIn The Hulk 2003 film It&#39;s different origin story and a new version and  It&#39;s about Dr. Bruce Banner and his relationship with his father   David Banner. But This Is a Reboot to Hulk With the origin story of the tv show. And there Is no saying of his father. In the comic books, The name Bruce&#39;s father Is Brian Banner. The 2008 Film may look like A Sequel or Stand-alone sequel to The Hulk Film of 2003 But It has a new Origin story of how he became the Hulk.<br>
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhy wasn&#39;t this hulk in the avengers?
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThe Incredible Hulk is one of my favourite Marvel movies.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaNext villains gotta be modok
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaAfter watching the again there is so much hint for the future of marvel! They Name drop shield ,stark industries, Nick fury, ironman and the obvious captain america pretty cool.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaLooking like The Leader will be the next villian 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it australian TV doesnt show this one??... They only show the Hulk 2003 one -_-
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite superhero 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI prefer this Hulk over the Avengers. A lot more intimidating and bulkier.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathat first scene was not in the movie...................
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqNb2PFKKA&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbqNb2PFKKA&amp;t=2m02s">2:02</a> 2nd best ending trailer for a superhero movie, behind the dark knight in my opinion
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitai liked this movie, personally liked this version of Hulk better than the avenger one..4 me this 1 looks more intimidating
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaSo if i take steroids i will be strong like this?
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaBest Hulk movie out there today, the 2003 Hulk movie was complete bullshit crap.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaFor those of you knocking the 2003 Hulk film, you should know that a lot of it was true to the first Hulk comics; Hulk vs US army in the desert (straight off the pages of the comic).  I loved both films, having been a Hulk fan for 22 years; but I do have complaints about both films.<br>2003: gamma irradiated dogs were kind of corny.<br>2008: no great leaps from the Hulk; (the first film nailed this, having the Hulk make mile leaps over the desert terrain) an awesome ability of his.<br>Both films: Not enough Hulk screen time.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitathis film was superb
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaFar as im concerned that man whole body is property of the US goverment ..that line so funny to me ,, sad but funny
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaI still admire every Hulk&#39;s pants. Good quality...
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaBest Hulk movie out there the 2003 version is crap.
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaThis film was excellent 
xbqNb2PFKKAdelimeterByIshitaCrap 
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitajust about died when i saw Andy &amp; Jorma
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaabercrobie!!? lmao
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaGrown Ups 2: All Grown Up
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaFirst I&#39;m like: &quot; Taylor Lautner has a shirt on? DA FUQ IS GOING ON HERE?&quot;
Then he says: &quot;nekid!&quot; 
Yup. That took like 5 seconds.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaLOL!!!!!!!
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will do slightly (and I do mean slightly) better than Jack &amp; Jill. 
Adam Sandler is a twat.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaHe knew better than to sign on to a second pile of shit movie.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaWhy?
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaBLONDE MILO VENTIMIGLIA WTFFFFFFFF

Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaNo.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaif the trailer is soooooooooooooooooo funny .............I can only imagine how the movie will be..............I can&#39;t wait 
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaIf there was ever a movie that did not warrant a sequel, it&#39;s Grown Ups. I&#39;ve never seen a movie with so many funny people (sans David Spade) be so damn UNfunny, not even a chuckle.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaShaq :D

Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaAnother Sandler&#39;s piece of total shit movie....... wow

Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitahahahahhaa
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaWatching a trailer and commenting doesn&#39;t make a sequel. Never have Hollywood commisions a sequel down to high views on the movies trailer on YouTube.
And I only viewed this because I saw a comment on Facebook about something that happened in the trailer, and wanted to see if it was true.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think Adam Sandler and Rob Scheinder are friends anymore, he hasn&#39;t been in Adams&#39; latest movies.
Sq5CIH0duMkdelimeterByIshitaKevin James naked ass, I am soooooo going to the cinema for this!!!

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshita29 June, cant wait!! :DDDDD
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaLook really funny surprisingly but to me males strippers arent sexy  guys s dance like that just looks funny haha
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitalike you guys have any other good idea of movies that haven&#39;t already been created.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaLooks stupid, why have a fucking love story?? Only going for Matt Bomer
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaHollywood has officially run out of ideas.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaWell I&#39;m gonna go see this movie :)
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaAwaome movie
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaEver thought about how crazy and messed up this world is? If so, you may be a truth seeker. Search Truth Contest in google and click on the first result. Then check out &quot;The Present&quot; on the homepage. This is not religion, it is truth you can check with your rational mind. 
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how this movie is going to fair in the box office with the males audience.   Seems like it&#39;s a movie solely for chicks.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaThe blonde girl is so bad at acting
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaNot gonna lie, but sooo looking forward to seeing this movie.

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaDeuce bigalow.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaA movie about a male stripper...
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitachanning is hot
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitayoutube .com/watch?v=XQype4c2_Kk
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaDude has no facial expressions
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitayou do know this was based off of the main character mike (channing tatum) true story in his life as a stripper before he became celeb. thats why they made this movie
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaThis is wrong on so many levels
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaZzz
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaDhhehegdgdheggehdghdheeg
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaHmm Trailed
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaThis is ad for song or lame movie?
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaWhats the first song?
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaWho made you god? I actually want to see it. Don&#39;t tell people that they have to dislike this just because YOU don&#39;t like it. You can just simply say, &quot;I don&#39;t want to see it.&quot; and step away. No need for hating on this.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitathx
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredibly bad
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaSTEP UP AT A STRIP CLUB! Amazing! Just amazing Hollywood! Keep making these great classics. If there has been no other teen movie that glorifies strippers, then by golly this movie going to start the trend! What&#39;s next? Pretty Woman remake with Kristen Stewart?
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaright, and not like men don&#39;t throw money at shitty shows like Transformers and Iron Man, right? Oh but wait, if it&#39;s target at men, it must be ok! You got mommy issues.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitano, it is from a great tv series but of course I don&#39;t expect you to know that. Are you a gas pump jockey, from your user name?
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitahey, nice video, check out mine as well, thanks

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaPlease Can we now get some real movies not like this crap
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitahows this different from american pie?
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaMore trash from Hollywood corrupting our generation. Dislike this trailer so Hollywood knows we&#39;re over this crap!

We want REAL movies, REAL storylines, REAL characters. Not some soft porn

And they wonder why our generation is messed up ...

Thumbs up if you agree!

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaYay this movie will be the next big thing because women will throw their money at anything with &quot;hot dudes&quot; in it, women are terrible with money, and Hollywood knows it :D

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitashe just wants to faaawk.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaoh shuddup, there are so many movies for guys with half naked girls in them, finally this one is for the ladies. Channing Tatum + Alex Pettyfer + male stripping = hot movie
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think it is your heart that should be ready..try a little down south.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaWas kinda interested in the trailer till the song popped up.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaProps to Channing Tatum for the role, cause doing this movie would be too much of a grown up decision for a lot of these dudes giving him crap.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaGay
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaGAAAHH!!! I CANT WAIT!!!!

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t really understand why this is R.. Seems like more of romantic drama then anything... What so he strips some not that big of a deal lol
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaJj

Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaWin win  - victim
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaChanning tatum used to be a male stripper before acting.
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so ironic because chaning tatum used to be a stripper in real life XD
Dd0XPRo4LZQdelimeterByIshitaMore trash from Hollywood corrupting our generation. 

Dislike this trailer so Hollywood knows we&#39;re over this crap. 

Give us some decent storylines for a change! Not some soft porn that teen girls will watch!

And they wonder why our generation is messed up ...

7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Benjamin button but I would like to see this.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S JUST LIKE FOREVER TV SERIAL
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitagreat storyline but lively was kind of bland
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathe song sounds a lot like Oblivion&#39;s 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitahuh, wonder if we&#39;ll see Thanos after the credits roll.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaIf you are a fan of Sci Fi then please also check out THE ADVENTURES OF CHARLZ FROM MARZ and HOW I SPENT MY SUMMER AT AN ALIEN ZOO available on Amazon.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaWow, Blake Lively is really beautiful and wonderful and this film, i look amazing!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a copy of Mircea Eliade&#39;s Youth without Youth
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathe soundtrack reminds me oblivion
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaOblivion!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitashe should meet &quot;the man from earth&quot;.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaActually looks decent
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitalooks good!! can&#39;t wait!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaPause at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzSekc0LoQ&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a>. For a moment, I thought it was the &quot;steps&quot; of the Metropolitan Museum from Gossip girl. Blair and Serena ♥
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitai guess she will commit suicide by the end :)
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie will be amazing 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaWhy music from Oblivion?
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaYou won&#39;t age but will have age spots on your face.  I&#39;ll pass this sickeningly sweet dogturd!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be good
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI NEED TO SEE THIS. I LOVE HER SO MUCH.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks absolutely gorgeous.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty good!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThere is already a TV series with more or less the same plot lines. It&#39;s called: Forever.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaomg yass this movie is fav
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really looking forward to seeing this film! Looks really interesting and well directed.<br>Blake Lively is so beautiful! As seems like a good actress.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathis look so amazing.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaAmazing story, will definitely watch it, but SERIOUSLY? Blake Lively? S-E-R-I-O-U-S-L-Y?! God -.-
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaShe is amazing. In every single way.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitashe is gorgeous!

7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one who likes it ?<br>look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzSekc0LoQ&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> she is P E R F E C T 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaM83 Oblivion soundrack???
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s such a torture to wait for the movie! The movie will hit the us theater in the middle of april. Have no idea when will it hit the asia
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis already looks as an amazing movie, I can&#39;t wait to watch it!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathis is so powerful. 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitadaario naharis!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaNot even exaggerating I&#39;ve probably watched this trailer over 70 times
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaExcited to see Michiel Huisman in this! :) (He plays Daario Naharis in Game of Thrones and Cal Morrison in Orphan Black.) He&#39;s so talented and very dreamy! Great to see him getting recognition.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. Can&#39;t wait
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitawhy dont she learn something good and find cure for cancer ? 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaWow! The trailer looks AMAZING! And Blake - gorgeous as always! I can&#39;t wait for the movie!!!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitagood premise, but has great potential to disappoint..
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaShe will be perfect for Steve Rogers Captain America. They don&#39;t age
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting! I&#39;ll definitely be seeing this movie!<br> Amazing cast!<br>p.s. Anyone watching, or has seen the new fall 2014 show, <b>Forever?</b>
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaAge of Adaline? Nope. Age of Ultron? Hell Yeah!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitappl who say blake lively can&#39;t act can go lick a clit and suck a dick. The fuck does that means, you haven&#39;t even seen the movie, and I am pretty sure no one would hire her if she couldn&#39;t act. bye ugh
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaOMFG BLAKE LIVELYLAÑDKSLGALKSDJG 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI hope the townspeople don&#39;t &quot;gossip&quot; about this &quot;girl&quot; because she doesn&#39;t age.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaA girly version of Highlander
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t want to judge a movie by it&#39;s trailer, but this one just suck! I really hope they make a new trailer that doesn&#39;t use a cheesy voiceover or overly dramatic sound that doesn&#39;t fit with the video at all.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaSong from the back?
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaWow! The actor who play as Young Harrison Ford look just like him. Did they use make-up to make him look like Young Harrison Ford or something? 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so pumped for this, Blake is truly timeless I want to see her fit perfectly into each fashion and style from all of the different time periods/ eras.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaKind of like that show forever on abc
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaDoes somebody know which song this is?
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI just love how Blake Lively looks in this movie. Waiting for it! :D
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty amazing! And Blake looks stunning as always.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitam83 - Oblivion soundtrack
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitathis trailer wouldnt even have gotten my attention if it wasnt for the oblivion soundtrack
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThen out spake brave Horatius,<br>the Captain of the Gate:<br>“To every man upon this earth<br>Death cometh soon or late.<br>And how can man die better<br>than facing fearful odds,<br>For the ashes of his fathers,<br>And the temples of his Gods
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so looking forward to this movie =D
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaEl mundo ha cambiado en un siglo y Adalina no. ¿Una reinterpretación de Dorian Gray? La película a estrenarse en el 2015 promete ser una joya para no perderse.
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaSo so so excited to see this movie! There&#39;s no better actress to play a timeless beauty than Blake Lively
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshita&quot;Beware Upper East Siders, Adaline is coming to town. Xoxo Gossip Girl&quot; xD<br>Can&#39;t wait to watch Blake. And she&#39;s so beautiful. :) 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaPromising trailer. What is this music?
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzSekc0LoQ&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a>? It is so amazing!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI need to watch this right now. Looks amazing!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaSpotted: Adeline Bowman using her timeless beauty to her advantage. Watch out Ad, don&#39;t wanna get a bad wrap when you&#39;ve been with a man from every generation.<br>Xoxo, Gossip Girl
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait. Blake is stunning, and I know she will nail this part. Just like she did everytime. I don&#39;t like that guy from Nashville they chose as her love interest though...
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshita&#39;The Curious Age of Adaline Bowman&#39;
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaSo Ellen Burstyn is essentially playing the same character as in &#39;Interstellar&#39;?
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaAnthony Ingruber .....beyond happy for you, hon! <b>applause</b> Can&#39;t wait to see this. 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait. It looks amazing
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks promising
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaMusic from oblivion
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaBlake is very pretty but she cannot act. 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait until this is released. It actually hurts to wait. I wanna see this so bad! I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be great
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaBlake Lively isn&#39;t a good actress, although she&#39;s so hot (she was great in The Town, to be fair, but never managed to repeat her talent there), but Harrison Ford and Daario Naharis are excellent and the music is from Oblivion!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaOMG. BLAKE IS SO CUTE.<br>I CAN&#39;T WAIT. <br>MY FUCKIN GOD. 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaSo gonna see this!!!! 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaHey it&#39;s Daario Naharis
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!! I really can&#39;t wait!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitawhat is this song??
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaAHHHH THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. You go Blake !!! 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshita <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Adaline">#Adaline</a> &#39;s spent her life running, never able to love. See Blake Lively in The Age of Adaline official trailer!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy Anthony Ingruber is FINALLY playing a young Harrison Ford!!
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshita Need to see this with Baxters (my other serena) 
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS
7UzSekc0LoQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so gooddddd x
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaSame recycled poor boy, rich girl concept that&#39;s used in EVERY romance movie. Boring 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaNeed to see this
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLove it because is just like my life 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone understand what he&#39;s saying at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQszhfoP_WI&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a>?? I tried rewinding the video like ten times, but I can&#39;t get it! 😣😣☺️☺️
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of the notebook....<br>
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaHoo boy. I&#39;m sorry but those guys in the truck. That is just plain silly.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaIs like a mix of Endless love, The Last Song and The notebook... 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaDid this remind anyone of The Little Mermaid on some parts?<br>Like him flying into the water because of the ship explosion and then when he wakes up, he sees the &quot;dream girl&quot;. And at the end with his quote,  &quot;I&#39;ve lost you once, I&#39;m not going to lose you again.&quot; That&#39;s almost exactly what Eric said before diving into the sea after Ursula takes Ariel. xD
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitais this notebook 2?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a sort of copy of Forest gump
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaNotebook 2
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaSooo the Notebook...
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLOL movie sucks so muich but it will make so much money cause women will love it!!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or does this storyline seem a lot like the notebook one?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaisnt the &quot;someone just said&quot; quote a Shakespeare fault in our stars quote?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaJames Marsden was also in the notebook xD
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaJames Marsden has potential, but he always chooses rolls that don&#39;t really help him improve in my opinion 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI guess it doesn&#39;t matter that the younger actors look nothing like their older counterparts. But maybe it is a good thing so that we can take sides of the better couple. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThat actor looks like Heath Ledger
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitai cried so bad with the book..!!! but still dying to watch the movie.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshita
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshita
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI Watched whole movie on this trailer
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitagod they gave the whole movie away
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLooks way too similar to Endless Love
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaAnother Love story! nice!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaHow beautiful movie :) James Marsden too
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitagosh I am so excited for this movie! I nearly cried while watching this trailer!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI would love it if he made a realistic story. Without the sarcastic first meeting or the witty first conversation. And mostly I would like it to be without this perfectly looking people.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaBetter love story than twilight .. ❤
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis is probably the worst casting choice I have seen in a long time - the &quot;younger&quot; version of James Marsden doesn&#39;t even look slightly like him - they even do look the same age!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaDifferent actors lô/
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaFrom Nicholas Sparks.. Im out
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaWhy does the older version of the guy look younger than the younger version??? lmao
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathis trailer just make me want to listen all of me even more
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaWho thought Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato would make acceptable younger versions of James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan? What horrible casting. Not to mention Luke Bracey is sooo old looking.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaYou can tell it&#39;s the same author as the notebook. Lol. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitawhat Dawson said at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQszhfoP_WI&amp;t=00m29s">00:29</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQszhfoP_WI&amp;t=00m37s">00:37</a> and other guy at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQszhfoP_WI&amp;t=00m46s">00:46</a>?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the initial track/song that plays around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQszhfoP_WI&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a>?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitasomeone please beat the shit out of nicholas sparks.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitalove the book! can&#39;t wait to see this!!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathe book was so frustrating. the ending was ridiculous. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaCouldnt they get some actors that actually look like each other? I mean come on. These Nicholas Sparks movies make so much bank.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaNo doubt women will like this movie. Simple minds, simple pleasures.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitai loved the notebook but this movie just seems empty and cheese, and the young version of the actors are terrible
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaIf I bawled like a baby during the book I think I might just have to be pieced back together after the movie 😭
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaanother movie where i will be crying cause forever single. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathat doesn&#39;t look exciting or teasing at all !! seems like every other love story movie <br>not sure though whether the book is better :/
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThat guy looks nothing like a young James Marsden.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitadid i just watch the WHOLe movie Or what !!!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathis is basically the notebook <del>_</del>......
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis wasn&#39;t really a trailer, it was pretty much a summary of 3/4 of the movie
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this just look like a mixture of the notebook and endless love??
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me a lot of The Notebook.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaKAMASUTRA !!!!!! =)
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of trailer song? :)
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaBasically the notebook just in the 2014 version 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI swear Nicholas Sparks makes the same thing over and over again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ugh">#ugh</a>
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaNicholas sparks always fucks with my emotions 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLooks good nice song selection for the preview but the title should have been &quot;all of me&quot; hahaha
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaMan, i cant believe The Notebook copied this film so bad. DAMN THEM!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThe older characters don&#39;t really look anything like the young characters.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaplease please please, don&#39;t end up like the book, please please please
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitacant wait!! 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaYoung Dawson looks like he&#39;s 30, wtf.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThese actors look nothing like each other.  Not convincing at all.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI look at movies like this that make teenagers looks so romantic and dramatic then I look at the teenagers I know and they&#39;re like &quot;Hey you wanna f**k, or NAH!!&quot; Smh
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaKissing in the rain, bad boy, good girl, hmmmm could this be a Nicholas sparks movie 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaDiscount Sandra bullock
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaa happy Gatsby story? This is why real life isnt like the movies
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathe Trailer killed the whole story , nothing left to watch 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaanother shit romance movie hollywood is making, YAWN!! 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaDamn you Sparks! Stop making me cry
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitafml
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks exactly like endless love.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even have to watch the trailer, Nicholas Sparks wrote the book so this movie is going to be amazing as always.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaa remake of the notebook?!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThe high school version of the main character looks older than the present day version.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis is basically the new Notebook. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaalready in tears ... i think i wil need some tissues at the movie
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaNicholas Sparks ya need to chill...
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaTypical Nicholas Sparks sappy ass melodrama.  Ugh.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaAnd to think Paul walker was supposed to play James marsden&#39;s character. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThis seems like another version of The Notebook.. Does Nicholas Sparks have any creativity left?
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitadaaaamn u nicholas sparks another love film my gf will watch over and over again stop doing them oftener than one for 10 years
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaRACIST!!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaFirst. lol
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaI just threw up a little
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitamy name is Dawson, so whenever they said it in the trailer i looked around my room trying to figure out who was talking to me.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaLooks sweet. Shame I just saw the whole movie, though.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaThat looks terribly cheesy. 
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaBAD DRAMA IS BAD ... and BTW, I know the whole story now .. this is no longer a trailer  
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaAnother love story...BORING!!! <br><br>Bring out the guns, cars and EXPLOSIONS!!
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitai so wanna see this!! OMG <b>_</b>
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitareally....not a single downvote?! pretty much saw the whole movie in 2 mins
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaWhat is it about trailers lately? They seem to be moving towards synopsis of the whole story rather that a teaser to get you to watch it.
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitaIf
cQszhfoP_WIdelimeterByIshitathis movie has been done once before?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWill it be better than the previous &quot;JOBS&quot;???
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaMichael Fassbender could play a tomato and it would be an Oscar-worthy performance
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitathis should be help us remember everything
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaHunger, Shame, 12 Years a Slave, and now Steve Jobs!! Fassbender is awesome, such a great actor.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like complete and utter shit.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitamovie looks more about kate winslet rather than jobs
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaAhhh..niceee but to be ann honest fan, Fassbender looks weird as Jobs, doesn&#39;t suit him :-/
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaPirates of Silicon Valley best movie
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaHaha!! Classic Apple...Bringing out a better version of the same thing every year!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be fucken great. I&#39;m too hyped for this now, it&#39;ll be a long wait. 
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaBecause fuck Ashton Kutcher that&#39;s why
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking fantastic. I wish Fassbender looked more like Steve but the movie looks like it has alot of tension and fantastic writing. Boyle and Sorkin are a good mix
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t give a damn how many Steve&#39;s movies are. I don&#39;t give a damn If people doesn&#39;t like it...BUT MICHAEL LOOKS HOT AS HELL
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitawhy fassbender hotter as jobs than himself..???
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI heard Benedict Cumberbatch is voicing Steve Job&#39;s pancreatic cancer. Great choice.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m amazed that this movie is from Danny Boyle and somehow Michael Fassbender got cast as Steve Jobs and did this bad an impression of the man.  He didn&#39;t even get the hair right; it&#39;s such a jarring error that it&#39;s absurd.  This appears to be a hyperbolic interpretation of the public perception of Jobs&#39; persona based on anecdotes, it is clearly a fabrication and so far removed from who Jobs actually was and how he acted that, quite honestly, this is garbage.  DB is an incredible film maker, but this is going to flop.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitalet see how many people agrees that Steve Jobs was a jerk..
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaASSHOLES who dislike this trailer are samsung ,windows users...!!!!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait....
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be amazing!!!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEr6K1bwIVs&amp;t=2m02s">2:02</a> Looks like Bruce Wayne in this scene
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWhy october 9, not september 9? It would be more logical... 
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitasteve jobs is overrated. he never wrote code for apple. he&#39;s just an idea man that took credit for what others built.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI just want to see people&#39;s thoughts on whether or not Steve Jobs took and got more credit that he deserved. Just a simple poll. If you agree he got too much credit, like this comment. If not. Like the reply just under this.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaMusicians play their instruments ... I play the Orchestra ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Powerful">#Powerful</a>
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer, especially the pacing is amazing. Big names, Big expectations. Can&#39;t wait.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI guess we are gonna watch a lot of fades
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks interesting.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen totally nailed, well Seth Rogen. Unless there&#39;s a different Woz history doesn&#39;t know about.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaToo much fucking hair.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWait a minute...wasn&#39;t Michael Fassbender suppose to be actually working on the upcoming Assassin&#39;s Creed movie???? Anyway i&#39;m still.loving thid upcoming Steve Jobs movie ;)
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitafucking cringe.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWho is Steve Jobs in this trailer??
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaYupppp! this looks good.... will Watch.....
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitawhy in the fuck are they making another one? the only jobs movie worth seeing is fucking pirates of silicon valley from TNT/TBS. fuck you hollywood
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaQuite an interesting human being but i am so happy to switch over from iphones...holy shit they are ripping people off...cheap restrictive phones...have an s6 now, 10 times better and more fun than an iphone...love the imacs tho...that&#39;s my tirade haha
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWait a minute...wasn&#39;t Michkael Fassbender supose to be worcking on the production of the upcoming Assassin&#39; Creed movie???? Anyway i&#39;m still loving this upcoming Steve Jobs movie ;)
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWait a minute...wasn&#39;t Michkael Fassbender supose to be worcking on the production of the upcoming Assassin&#39; Creed movie???? Anyway i&#39;m still loving this upcoming Steve Jobs movie ;)
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t this already been done?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaLooks very energetic.  Is it just me or does some scenes look a bit grainy, don&#39;t know how else to put it.  Some scenes just look a little more clearer than others.  Still looking forward to Fassbenders performance more than the actual story.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaактеры не похожи на реальных персонажей..
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be amazing.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaVery curious to see Seth Rogen. Fassbender will be amazing.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaFassbender is a genius. He might not look like the part, but he sounds and moves and =radiates= like the part.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitathis not accurate, Steve jobs wasnt that hot  * <b>drools</b> *
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaHYPE!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWhat about &quot;Jobs (2013)&quot;? That was a great movie, and Ashton Kutcher nailed it!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWow.Just give Fassbender the Oscar now.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaAnother Steve Jobs movie? What gives?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshita...and thus a new generation of assholes with visions of grandeur are born.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshita<b>fade to black</b>
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks alright doesn&#39;t look like a record breaker but I&#39;ll definitely go check it out
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t we just have a film about steve jobs?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaNice actor just not feeling it 100% as Jobs, still I will watch it. Reminds me of that Beatles movie where nobody looked like any of them.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaCAN&#39;T WAIT!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaApple sucks... overpriced shit with very old hardware.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t they ever seem to get Woz right?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis is the Moneyball of Apple. Billy Beane sure doesn&#39;t look like Brad Pitt, Steve Jobs sure as hell didn&#39;t look like Magneto.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI was confused who the actor of Steve Jobs was during first minute of the trailer...<br>The actor does not even have the resemblance of Steve Jobs at all!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitawas steve jobs addict to sex?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaMagneto, wtf are you doing ?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaTo all the people saying he doesn&#39;t look like Steve, He&#39;s not trying to look like a splitting image of Steve he is trying to tell the true story of Steve... It&#39;s called acting.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis cast, the director, the writer. It looks absolutely genius.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaSome of the best cinematography of the year. 
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaBill Gates - changing the world. Steve Jobs - creating gadgets.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaHollywood should just stop! we get it, Steve Jobs was great and all but this trailer is nothing but a cheap attempt to sell tickets. Looks too over dramatized.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaeven he doesn&#39;t look like Steve Jobs, so what? Whataver, because Ashton is not good actor. However, nowadays Fassbender is one of the greatest actor. His acting could be noticed EVEN by this trailer. More better than Kutcher. <br><br>For example, 12 years of slave, Jane Eyer  and his roles in these movies. Awesome.<br><br>In addition, this &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; is gonna be controversial film because the first phrase of trailer is &quot;you are not an engineer, you are not a designer....the graphical interface was stolen...so, how come ten times in a day I read that Steve Jobs is a genius?&quot;. This short monologue is very good. Very. <br><br>So I have no doubt that this movie is gonna be absolutely FANTASTIC.<br><br><br>p.s.<br>Aaoron Sorkin is screenwriter. He is a person who gives us movies like &quot;Moneyball&quot; or &quot;The Social Network&quot;. So there are no question about screenplay
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaErm, &quot;the graphical user interface was stolen&quot; ?  No...Xerox developed it, agreed to show it to Apple and then Apple eventually purchased the licensing from them.  If anything, Microsoft stole it from Apple with Windows...
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaMake a Bill Gates biopic instead...This guy doesn&#39;t even resemble Steve Jobs, not even a bit. 
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this is utter nonsense! I can&#39;t even take Seth Rogen seriously....
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good! Fassbender bashers will eat their own bitter words!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis stinks. Just go watch Jobs
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen? Why?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaOnly Samsung users are disliking this.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaAnd This This the PERFECT Biopic of STEVE i was waiting for...
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWhoa. I&#39;m not the biggest Steve Jobs fanboy or anything, but this looks damn good. Looking forward to it.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitahe doesn&#39;t even look like steve jobs,  Ashton Kutcher did a better job in that movie!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI got chills over this one! 
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI was super skeptical but this looks great. Glad that it&#39;s not taking itself too seriously like the Ashton Kutcher mess did.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI hate to be that guy but damn does anybody know the song in the beginning of the trailer?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaDude doesn&#39;t deserve multiple films about him
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI hope this ones better than the one with Ashton Kutcher. Michael Fassbender&#39;s got this though he&#39;s top notch.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaStill waiting for the Bill Gates biopic.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, but the fact Fassbender doesn&#39;t look nothing like Jobs will be a turn off. Bales/DiCaprio would of been perfect for the role.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of the Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours, screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, and an ensemble cast. Count me fucking in.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaGreat!
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaThis basically looks like another Social Network (albeit with a different directing style).......and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWe all know how a Steve jobs movie went down last time... Let&#39;s not make the same mistake twice.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaanother?
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s really hard for me to accept Fassbender as Steve Jobs, yet I still want to see the movie because the acting and the script seem solid.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaMy God how he doesn&#39;t look like Steve… But I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do a great act on it.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaLooks lame. The title said it&#39;s about Steve Jobs, but he doesn&#39;t look anything like him.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaWith Fincher, you get polish and precision. With Boyle, you get energy. Win some, lose some.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaI like the fact than the movie go back on his life.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaGod.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaС нетерпением ждем!<br>Надеюсь получится отличная картина.
aEr6K1bwIVsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t WaIT $$

kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitammm Ed Helms not even close to Chevy Chase&#39;s comedy talent!!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWhy was Anthony Michael Hall not playing his character in this? He&#39;s an active actor! He has stuff in post production this year. Jesus.. Louis C.K. would have been better than Ed Helms.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaI feel like this is one of those movies that has the most goddamn amazing screenplay, but some of worst acting procedures possible.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitafor me will more good movie if make a remake with Will Ferrell as Chevy Chase, I know Chevy Chase don´t have replacement but is the more close to himself
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitasomeone knows the name this music of hiphop of trailer?
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis looks so funny
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaIf this is a big hit i want Christmas Vacation!

kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s American comedy nowadays. The humor comes not from fun characters, clever writing, or any kind of jokes, but from watching celebrities do weird and disgusting things.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis looks extremely funny, i just hope they saved some jokes for the movie
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s the villain turn from We&#39;re the Millers to go on vacation
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaisnt that the kid that comes in shane dawsons videos?
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis is the age of awkward movies. i love et

kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaneed to see this
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaAhhh yesss! I&#39;m so hyped for this!! Can&#39;t wait to see it!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll stick to the original and Christmas Vacation. This looks like another We&#39;re the Millers type movie not a Vacation movie.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaSorry, but this will never beat the original.. as usual.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song starts at the 1 minute mark in this trailer? 
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaDoes look pretty funny. Great cast.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a><br>key from key and peele

kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m totally gonna watch this!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThey filmed this in Atlanta! That&#39;s the Six Flags Over Georgia Ninja on steroids lol
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaMeh. I already hate those fucking kids.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThey better not mess this up. I love the Vacation series.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaѕσ thє dαd íѕ ѕuppσѕє tσ вє ruѕѕ αѕ αn αdult αnd thαt íѕ híѕ fαmílч ín thє futurє?
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWell it&#39;s a different kind of humor thanthe original vacation movies but stil looks funny
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitadid that child say &quot;go to sleep! go to sleep!&quot;<br>GO AWAY JEFF
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m16s">1:16</a> The little one is so mean... =(. Lol.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis looks like it is going to be shite.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaLooks super funny!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaHow many men over 18 looked at the girl in a sexual way. Men are perverts, there is a reason 18 is legal. Historically 18 has always been the sign of an adult
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a> it&#39;s Dale from Horrible Bosses!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaSo much for america&#39;s education
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitawow this single trailer ruined what the original films built up to be comedy classics, they have added more filth and probably more language which doesn&#39;t suit the rest of the franchise, lamer jokes as well
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a> is that Key?
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> Your Welcome ;D
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaPlease tell me they filmed at Six Flags Magic Mountain for this. If its not Magic Mountain,  it&#39;s not Walley World. 
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaSong at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> is Party Favor - Bap U
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWhen I saw the beginning of this trailer, I thought, &quot;Wow this is a really big rip-off of Vacation.&quot;<br>Then I saw it was a remake.<br>wtf
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=0m15s">0:15</a> her hair should not fly in front of her. her hair flies against the wind. XD
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitalol
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaLooks hilarious, literally was crying laughing at this! lol Cannot wait to see it lol
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaRob Corddry would of been the best choice for Russ.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaIf they do a sequel, will Rusty be recast again<br>xD
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaOMFG I SAW THE NINJA FROM SIX FLAGS OVER GEORGIA!!!
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaughhh, I sincerely consider National Lampoon Vacation one of the worst movies I have seen, that my fucking Dad made me watch when I was a kid. Maybe I was born cynical and depressed because even when I was 6 I remember sighing and rolling my eyes at every low brow joke that movie threw my way, which was about every 2 minutes, never cracked a smile (nor at Lampoon Christmas for that matter) And I had an epiphany that day, as I watched my family pissing themselves laughing, that I had indeed been born into a family of idiots.<br> <br>And now nearly 2 decades later that movie comes back to haunt me with it&#39;s bastard abomination movie child. If I only had a time machine, fuck Hitler, I would kill John Hughes. (The only real sacrifice would be The Breakfast Club)<br> <br>And though I know it&#39;s cliché, I am not sure I have ever said this more earnestly &quot;I don&#39;t want to live on this planet anymore&quot;
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=0m36s">0:36</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m48s">1:48</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kleG7XCqOb4&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> That&#39;s the Ninja at Six Flags Over Georgia in case anybody was wondering. It&#39;s an awesome ride but shakes your head a lot and usually gives me a headache. As a result the line is never more than a 5 minute wait. 7/10 would recommend.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaI like vile humor, but trailer was not remotely funny. I have a feeling this will bomb hard.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaHA HA HE JUST TRIED TO KILL HIS BROTHER THAT IS SO not funny. This looks like shit. 
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis. Looks. AWFUL.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaThis should be interesting...
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitahilarious movie. XD

kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re the Millers 2
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaNo. Just no. Can we please stop fucking up great movies from the past? This is like the 5 remake announced in the last year. 
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaWe didn&#39;t need this.<br>The original was perfect.
kleG7XCqOb4delimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thought of We&#39;re The Millers?

QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitayou know why Jason Statham movies are all like this?<br><br><br>short man syndrome.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJack reacher and now this, hollywood out of ideas
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham is just movie Steroids
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaTake my goddamn money
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThe first 1 sucked, I&#39;m  surprised  they made a sequel.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaBadass jason statham... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Beast">#Beast</a>
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaHitman 47! Especially him cracking the bottom of that glass swimming pool, reminds me of that mission &quot;You Better Watch Out...&quot; in Blood Money
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaYou know it&#39;s gonna be bad when &quot;resurrection&quot; is in the title.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaMake it look like an accident.... Blood and explosions everywhere
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song that gets played in this movie
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham does action movies pretty well, so I expect this movie to be at least decent, if not good.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitawow amazing i like  Jason Statham movie
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWho else was waiting at the end something like this ... &quot;Your mission, if you chose to accept ,,,,&quot;
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll see it only because Jessica Alba is in it.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitathe first movie was kinda shit so this better be good.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWe need Crank 3!!! But I probably will watch this movie anyway.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaDecurd Shaw returns. 😂
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThat CGI at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF903RaKLvs&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> is awfull.... hope they fix all that
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitathis time it better good Statham! a good movie from u is long overdue
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaman u are awesomeness...... respect
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaKill them Jason.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaHmm things people do for pussy!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaHope they clean up the CG and green screen. Pretty terrible looking.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWould see it but I&#39;m completely over Jessica Alba
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaI was the 1000th thumbs up. Just saying.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThe amazing, Jason Statham. This dude is dope.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason does it again can&#39;t get enough of him
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaYES
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaMr kickass is back with more kickass and whole lot of action!!!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF903RaKLvs&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> the explosion looked so realistic like wow
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaCOOOOOL
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaMechanic: Greenscreen
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaDoes this remind anyone of Splinter Cell?!?!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaIt looks very good.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitawow!!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve always loved Jessica alba, but her choice in movie roles don&#39;t do her justice.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita1.33
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be awesome!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaStatham&#39;s one of the few actors that can get away with playing the same character over and over because he&#39;s just so freaking awesome at it.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaKiller Elite 2 woot!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitalooks good&amp;wicked.its about time he came back.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWHOA!!!!!!!   Did Jessica alba just say VISHAL (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF903RaKLvs&amp;t=0m45s">0:45</a>)..........I think she did, its so cool to hear my name from Jessica alba.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaFinally. This is what a Jason Statham Movie should look like.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF903RaKLvs&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> the explosion...
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaТомми Ли Джонс выглядит охрененно круто
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaIm still waiting for The One: 2
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitawho wants statham in a rom com? :D
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF903RaKLvs&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a> 👀....thank me later.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason@ you&#39;re an awesome, man...<br>My Inspiration..
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome. First one was meh, but damn does this look like an amazing sequel, hopefully they get it right this time!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham Jumps From Tall Heights: The Movie. <br>Seriously though, I can&#39;t wait. Loved the first one with him. It&#39;s good to see Tommy Lee Jones not playing a grumpy Gus for once.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaTransporter became Mechanic... Why is Jessica Alba here?
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitanooo why. this looks it will have a different vibe from the first one.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaNO!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaCan we get a bald James Bond?
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJASON STATHAm..THE  MOVIE!XDf
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitano good comments?
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaI wanted to like the look of this, but unfortunately it looks like shit.  immediately put off it by the ridiculous swimming pool hit at the start of the trailer
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham never disappoints
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaYeah, looking great!!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the entire thing was shot on a greenscreen
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitamission impossible St.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaSo excited for this movie, i cant wait!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaAd
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still gonna go see this but isn&#39;t basically Killer Elite recasted?
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaJason Statham, the man with a punch 👶👶👶👶
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaAnyone think there&#39;s too many booms and explosions? Loved the first one because it was so silent and strategic. This one just screams too much actions.. Perfect for the American audience.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWow.  This unwelcome sequel can fuck right off (much like the remake that preceded it).
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaLooks OK, but it can&#39;t even compare to the 1972 original with Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent. Just my opinion :-).
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita&quot;You have to make it look like an accident&quot;. Cue, explosions, fist fights, knifes, machine guns... &quot;Low key&quot; is not in Jason Statham&#39;s repertoire, sister.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitasoundtrack?
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitawhat a white knight mangina
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaStatham&#39;s gonna Statham, and I&#39;m okay with that.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Make it look like an accident&quot;.<br>Oh wow, would you fucking look at that, this shit is more Hitman than that Agent 47 movie.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising! Can&#39;t wait to watch it, especially considering Statham&#39;s last movies were quite average at best.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitahitman x)
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitabaddass
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaYup Jessica Alba is still hot
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this movie. freaking badass
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaBu yorum çok tutulur
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaNah, this looks like shit... and I love the first one
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaLionsgate never disappoints
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaaaaaaaaaawwwww yeaaaaaaaa Jason mf&#39;ing statham back at it again kicking ass. day one I&#39;m there.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThe Legend is BACK!!!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaBadass... I hope they didn&#39;t show all the best action in trailer.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaSo much CGI, still hyped though
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaThe first one was kinda boring, but it looks like this one will be fun.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitammmmmm jessica
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song ???
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Transporter 1 all over again .

QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s awesome... After Transporter Jason Statham Back with something Cool.
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit !!
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaawesome
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaТомми Ли Джонс наконец играет харизматичного персонажа, а не занудного старикана
QF903RaKLvsdelimeterByIshitaWOW BADASS !!!
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaTrailer reveals way too much.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaHollywood run out of ideas
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Ready or Not but without comedy aspects
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshita❤️
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaYou guys just showed us the whole movie.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaReady or Not with Vampires
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI just watched the entire movie
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaFinally  a vampire  movie
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaA large majority of comments : <br>It&#39;s not...🤔 <br>Pfff! it&#39;s just... 😌<br>humm, it looks like Ready or Not right ? 🤔<br><br><br><br>Me: of course. We know that there is only one movie about vampires in the world, or about a handsome agent who kills everyone but never dies, or the best, a hanted house or a cabin in the woods. 🙄<br><br><br>how dare they get inspiration from another movie, goodness, sacrilege.😌<br><br><br><br>I think that by force we end up forgetting the main reason why we watch a film, its story. Why not judge it after watching. 😀<br><br>Ready or Not is not the first of its kind either. he himself was, again, criticized for looking too much like another film. Come on !😏
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaready or not meets get out
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie seems like ready or not (for obvious reasons) and the hunt put together since everybody around the area is in on it
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI was intrigued but then you just spoiled the ending!
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSaw this trailer before The Black Phone. I commented halfway through the trailer that this should be called &quot;Downton Stabby&quot;. And I think you all missed out on a far better name.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure by now yall know better than to watch a trailer in 2022 if you not tryna see the whole movie in less than 3 minutes.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaHere for Thomas Doherty and Thomas Doherty only

5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSony pictures making bangers movie from no way home
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSomething tells me this is going to have a family of vampires
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI see why people think it looks like ready or not , but there isn’t really much similarities it feels like it’s own thing
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaOkay.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitalooks creepy and I&#39;ll give it a shoot
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaLooking good 🧛🏻‍♀️🧛🏻‍♀️🧛🏻‍♂️🧛🏻‍♂️🧛🏻‍♂️🦇🦇🦇🦇

5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Dad :” family plan “ episode 😂
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks totally lame, I&#39;m still waiting for the Salem&#39;s Lot Trailer that&#39;s a vampire movie to look forward to
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing the entire plot in a trailer!
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaCryptkeeper: And here&#39;s Something else i&#39;ve been Working out, it&#39;s a Nasty Nugget about a Young Woman who has no Relatives she&#39;s in for A Wedding &quot;To die For&quot;, i Call it: The Invitation.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks unbelievably bad
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Ready or Not&quot; meets &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSean Pertwee 🔝🔝💙💙🧡🧡💛💛💜💜
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaDay 80 of asking Sony to make an Amazing Spider-Man 3
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaReady or not
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaStab through the heart!
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaPatiently waiting for this
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaHummm Vampires.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaHow much you want this movie to look like &quot;Ready or Not&quot; <br>Producers: Yes
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis feels like Ready or Not with Samara Weaving so can&#39;t wait for it!
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitatamil dubbing movie
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer scared me during the previews of The Black Phone (2022)
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThe invitation is ready🔥🔥🔥
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaFrom the team who bought you harry potter and x-men
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSaw this trailer during Black Phone. Looks interesting but not sold on it
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t expect it was a vampire movie...
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a rip off of Ready or Not
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Ready or Not but this time it&#39;s incest.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaBlack female version of Ready or Not..😜😜
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s morbin time
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it look like &quot;Ready or Not&quot; ?
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI could be the 1k viewer
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaFun fact:everyone found his channel randomly but started watching him regularly ❤ <br>Sony pictures
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaNahh, the story looks jacked. Not really a scary thriller.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaIs this like a Ready or Not sequel or something?
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaSo this is basically a british version of ready or not 😭
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Like a Similar to Ready or Not Movie.
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks to nice
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaThey Should’ve Been Adding Blumhouse Productions In There
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bL1ftuxgOE&amp;t=1m28s">1:28</a>

5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshita2nd
5bL1ftuxgOEdelimeterByIshitaI respect everyone who were involved in this Seriously the best piece that i ve ever seen on YouTube 💌 Hate off to well all 💟 love your videos
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitai&#39;m in.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaLooks like a horror version of The Animal (that old comedy with rob schneider.) You guys remember that movie, right? No, just me? Ok then...
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaIs it too hard for some people to fathom the concept of horror-comedy
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis looks great. Mike Zero? I guess its appropriate youve named your self that, essentially admitting you aint shit. You always go around dumping on people for their social contributions? While yours add a up to your namesake,  exactly zero.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaNope, can&#39;t sit thru another one of these &quot;human centipede&quot; ordeals..
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like garbage.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! Can&#39;t wait! :D
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita&quot;I don&#39;t want to die in Canada&quot;. Funny, Kevin.<br><br>Looks really unique. Kevin is such a groundbreaking artist (for such a humble and fun-loving guy). <br><br>I see this being yet another cult classic from Mr. Smith. 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaWow! I can&#39;t believe how amazing this looks. I was excited before, but now I it goes beyond that. The trailer lived up to the expectations I had based on Kevin Smith saying it was amazing. A big, fat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WalrusYes">#WalrusYes</a> all over your face neck and chest. 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis is exactly what I thought it could be, and alot more. I can&#39;t bloody wait! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WalrusYes">#WalrusYes</a> 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaClerks 3!!!!!!!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaas stupid as the manimal.. durrrhuuumm.. a funny guy making a horror? 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI see fat people :c
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaOBVIOUSLY HE GETS TURNED INTO A FUCKING WALRUS<br><br>DUMB!!!!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitais Johnny Depp in this movie ?
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI love all the &quot;human centipede&quot; comments. It&#39;s like it as much as he&#39;s sewing shit up but that&#39;s where the similarity ends really doesn&#39;t it... Anyways Kevin said it&#39;s like a &quot;cuddlier&quot; version of the human centipede. I for one are very excited for this movie. Can&#39;t wait to see Michael Parks deliver some awesome dialogue. Walrus motherfucking yes.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaZłodziej!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve waited so long for this!!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI get excited when Kevin Smith does something we don&#39;t expect, don&#39;t get me wrong, his comedy is genius and I cannot wait for Clerks 3! But after watching this trailer I&#39;m excited to see a horror film with that Kevin Smith flavour on it. I can tell it&#39;s going to be unique and just great!  
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaWalrus YES
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaCannot fucking wait!!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaTo those who are saying it looks stupid - look up his reasons for making this film. He talks about it on one of his Q and As and his reasoning is epic.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI DONT WANT TO DIE IN CANADA LOL
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThe kid from 6th sense...he&#39;s still the same except a lot of stubble. BTW creepy movie though..gonna watch it..(Y)
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQJnOn0ru0&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> That fall just... It doesn&#39;t work, it looks too comedic if that&#39;s supposed to be part of the point where it turns dark. The whole point should be that the premise is not quite serious in and of itself, there don&#39;t need to be additional comedic moments all the way through. I&#39;m not sure if they managed to make it work that way. But the movie seems to be quite strong visually, which is something relatively novel for Kevin Smith films. :D
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitadid anyone bust out laughing when he said he doesnt want to die in CANADA? :D As if it was alright if this happened to him anywhere else.. 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaif you die in Canada you die in real life!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaLooks much better than I thought it would.  Parks is always good in Lunchbox&#39;s films
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaShould have turned him into a kangaroo.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing and there&#39;s supposed to be a bunch of easter eggs from the SModcast universe!! Can&#39;t wait.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaJustin Long looks like the most out of place actor ever, in this.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaOF COURSE there&#39;s the podcast references in the beginning haha fucking Kevin
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t fuckin wait.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita&quot;La piel que habito&quot; + The &quot;Dolphinoplasty episode&quot; from South Park (Mr. Garrison&#39;s Fancy New Vagina) + Kevin Smith&#39;s humour = TUSK.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaMichael Parks is worth the price of admission...
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita&quot;I don&#39;t wanna die in Canada.&quot; Hahaha!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaLike EVIL DEAD?? <br>Buy this <a href="http://ryanmeadesmovies.wix.com/invaluablemovie">http://ryanmeadesmovies.wix.com/invaluablemovie</a>
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like its suffering from a severe identity crisis. Am I supposed to be laughing or scared? And Justin Long looks like Carrie from Portlandia as a man.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaSo... this is what people today finds funny?...
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaWOW This looks more creepy than I imagined. This is the type of creativity to bring me back to the movie theaters.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to watch it! I died laughing at I don&#39;t want to die in Canada. 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaShout out to all the people who have already reviewed the film just from the trailer. Your negativity is always appreciated
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaHuh, way more comedic than I thought.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting a &quot;The Human Centipede&quot; vibe
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaSo, it&#39;s like &#39;the human centipede&#39;  just with a walrus and only one guy.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaKevin this is BRILLIANT!!!!! I have to see this.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this :-) 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQJnOn0ru0&amp;t=0m32s">0:32</a> was that guy from Epic Meal Time? 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI think I spotted Harley M. from Epic Meal Time at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQJnOn0ru0&amp;t=0m31s">0:31</a>
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitajust like human centipede but not as good for sure 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp plays a detective in this and that&#39;s his daughter standing next to according to comments Kevin Smith&#39;s daughter @ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQJnOn0ru0&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a>
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WalrusYes">#WalrusYes</a>
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t wanna die in Canada. haha
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaStupidest film of 2014 goes to.....TUSK<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for CinemaSins to shit all over this. <br><br>Quoting a poet and acknowledging it CLICHE<br>Old man who knows something CLICHE<br>Justin Long<br>Justin Long with a mustache<br>Making fun of Canadian accents CLICHE<br>Acting as if a Podcast is the same as journalism.<br><br>This looks stupid as fuck. 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThanks so much Kevin &amp; Scott. Amazing, cannot wait to see this.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaFirst Half of the Preview Looks Interesting but the Last Half Looks STUPID!! 
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaWTF.......
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t explain what the fuck this trailer is/means if someone asked me, I just know that I&#39;ve gotta see it!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitacan we have Clerks 3 now?
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaHoly shit, Kev.  Stick to comedy, it&#39;s what you&#39;re good at.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaA more twisted version of Misery.   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WaitForRedbox">#WaitForRedbox</a>  
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaim a Kevin smith fan but this looks kinda disapointing just reminds me of the human centipede but using a walrus
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaFuck this actually looks pretty good. Hope we won&#39;t have to wait too much in Europe.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita&quot;I don&#39;t wanna die in Canada!&quot;
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThe moment you watch a trailer and instantly know you&#39;re going to love the movie, right here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Walrusyes">#Walrusyes</a>

BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaWTF?
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaNever before has a Baculum been the precursor to such fear................well, probably a few times before depending on what end of it you were on. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Walrusyes">#Walrusyes</a>
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitais comedy?
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting, will have to wait and see.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaHoly shit is that a fat Haley Joe Osment? I see fat people!
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaGood to see his daughter is in it too haha.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis is awesome. After listening to the podcast I was afraid I would go see the movie knowing too much. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m so wrong.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshita...And so begins the catalyst for The Great Canadian-American War...A war which will be talked aboot for generations to come..
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaThis kinda inspired a movie in my head to work on.
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaDonald ty szmato
BCQJnOn0ru0delimeterByIshitaAmazing, this film is going to be Awesome. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WalrusYes">#WalrusYes</a>

Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitafassbender could pant into my ear for mere seconds and I would be more bothered than the main character of this movie
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI dont get it.  The story didnt go anywhere. Just an hour and a half of watching a porn addicted shallow wanker doing his thing and then getting upset about it. I wanted to see the guy get help or find someone he cared about.  It was well made and acted. But didnt go anywhere.  I guess the ending when he was sat on the train was kind of left open.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaSteve McQueen directs the world sees Nichole Beharie Fassbender&#39;s really dark
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaHow does Disney feel about having this film in their collection?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIf I didn&#39;t know any better I&#39;d say this is an American Psycho sequel

Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaHow to download this movie from where?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaMaravillosa película, gran interpretación
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaLOL una parte d lavoro.. bei toni..
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaDisney owns <i>Searchlight Pictures</i> now.<br><br>Don&#39;t expect anything rated higher than PG-13 now.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaبابا لَا تحاول يقاضي مرآة اخرى,,,,  no 🌸
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI remember watching this movie with my GF in Korea and when the nude scene came where Fassbender is walking around his apartment with his giant penis dangling about, literally all the chicks in the room were like: &quot;Woaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh&quot;. Rather hilarious :b
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWhere i&#39;ll get this full movie?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a Crazee movie,  Fassbender is in  Freewheelin&#39; role here...<br>More freaky than free  in truth, cause this guy is a slave, a modern slave <br>Sex as a weapon kinda... The Benatar song should have been in the soundtrack <br>Mulligan is the wounded sister,  both are wounded , but it&#39;s not straightly apparent, it&#39;s between the mesh<br>We can guess that... this guy was  a probalble victim in his childhood days,  (oh what a mirror)<br> I haven&#39;t seen Michael Fassbender that much in recent years,   where he is gone ?  Too many underground movies ?  Or Theatre roles in full time ?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaNow I have seen twists. Some of the best films have to offer. Talk about Fight Club. Talk about The Sixth Sense. But I have never seen a twist as good as when Michael Fassbender didn&#39;t end up fucking his sister.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaGreat film. I did my final film project base on Steve McQueen’s earlier works due to this film.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaCOOMER: The Movie
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gives me chills.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita3£$t%y^&amp;*()!@$4@±
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaGreat fucking movie
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaYou come in here and you&#39;re a weight on me, a burden.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaoutstanding movie one of my favs Michael does awesome work in this one,again.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIt turns you on in a very uncomfortable way. 💗
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitafrom  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9iQiB_ANI&amp;t=51m45s">51:45</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9iQiB_ANI&amp;t=51m59s">51:59</a> .I like how his perception of my ideal is achieved... like hell yeah reality speaking ,
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite line from the movie: &quot;We&#39;re not bad people; we just come from a bad place.&quot;<br><br><br>I think a lot of people can relate to that.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaNow i do feel it, thanks mate
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThis film is so relatable to those that are sexually frustrated not finding a proper romantic relationship. A classic I must say.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it ...
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how Disney feels owning this movie now
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaTo me cinematic art can be ulgy, neutral, good, and masterful.<br><br>The ulgy films barely make sense, make you feel nothing, and uses manipulation to give you some artificial feel that cheapens the entire ordeal of movies. The neutral ones keep my attention, gives me a few chuckles and keeps the story moving, I am entertained but not enough to ever watch the film again. The good films take into effect the plot, how it explores one aspect of human nature, or emotion, or curiosity, the play of the characters, their direction in the movement, and captures it in a unique way or at least an entertaining way. The good movies can make you feel a certain emotion like awe or inspiration or love, and explore it deep enough that you&#39;re left wanting more.<br><br>The masterful movies does all the things a good movie does, but with any topic it chooses to explore, instead of brushing at the surface, deep dives into the blue, it describes the taste of salt, the light peaking against the waves above, the muffled sound of the seagles and air bubbles, the texture, weight and warmth of how the ocean hugs you. The masterful films let&#39;s you look to the ocean floor, and explore the colors or lack of light, gives you a quiet space to yourself, and captures the feel of it all. The masterful films takes every scene as a way to capture the fullness of a moment, molds it as if clay, and shapes it into a shape equal parts warm, beautiful, mesmerizing, cutting and soft. It dares us to ask who we are, and where are we going as a species, and whether that is the right direction. It dares to put a mirror in front of us and make us look. Shame, a 2011 film about sex addiction, was in a word - masterful
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaafter watching the second time, I realize all through out the movie he has the burden of guilt about his past incestuous incident with his sister. that&#39;s the reason the movie titled SHAME
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitathe trailer doesn&#39;t do the movie justice. it was a masterpiece
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitanow thats a good trailer
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaHawww shame shame
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie but I haven’t seen the whole feature. Once I need to purchase this movie on Google Play through Movies Anywhere.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant film about how addiction, any addiction, controls pretty much every aspect of our lives. The ending is what really got me. There&#39;s a ménage à trois going on with Fassbender and two women. Toward the end of the scene, after much frienzed love-making between the three, Fasbender is eating this chick&#39;s a$$ from behind while she&#39;s on all fours, then he pops up on his knees and starts nailing her from behind. The camera slowly pans in on his face as he&#39;s pumping away - and the look in his eyes is just mind-blowing. It&#39;s a look of monumental desperation: &quot;Help me. Help me. I&#39;m trapped in this sex addiction and I can&#39;t make it stop! I should be enjoying this but it has become a complete nightmare!&quot; One of the best movies about addiction I&#39;ve ever seen. It really makes you feel bad for the guy, even though he is a real douchebag most of the time.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI use to be like this, 5 years ago, but I got out of it this kind of life, it will make you spiral down and you need to get out of it or your life will go no where
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaFassbender, Mulligan, the score, the editing. It still makes me chills
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaYou are all lost aren&#39;t you?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies of all time
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about borderline
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movie after nymphomaniac.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most underrated movies of the 2010s
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest films of all time
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThe thing about sex addiction is that they can have an abundance of sex and still be unfulfilled because of the inabilities of the sex addict to connect on a deeper mental, emotional and spiritual level....in other words really good lovers are those that can have intimacy without having sex, because its very possible to have sex and no intimacy....that makes for the phenomenon of craving that cannot be met or satisfied on a mere physical level.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThis was the first movie to get me into cinematography, film score, and made me so emotional at the same time. One of my favorite movies ever so beautiful
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThe ending 10 minutes scene with a re-elaborated music from The Thin Red Line alone is worth the vision of a fantastic film.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaHe has a sex addiction
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIt was really painful to hear her destroy a beautiful song! <br>Such a sad story. Fassbender was terrific in this film. He should have been given the role as Christian Grey in 50 Shades. Why let all that talent go to waste! Lol!
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitait is movie for gay. watch other movie actress hide nothing.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThis film just makes me feel. I haven&#39;t the vocabulary to properly describe how and what it makes me feel, but it had a profound effect on me and I have no idea what I want in life.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a great film and trailer, Truly underappreciated
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is so fantastic and clever in hiding so many things. I loved the film, especially Michael and Carey&#39;s performances and the cinemaotography
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI feel like i just watched my life from another persons view
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaGood film on Addiction and New York,  sort of about  he cannot have intimacy when emotions are involved and downward spirals, he could have killed someone,  or got aids,  possibly I thought at one stage,     remember some Pauly Shore film and he electric was off so was using porn box,   it could have got much worse.  he could have been homeless lost job,   maybe this is why society is like it is,  either that or reptilian part of brain,   Some Nudity,  but not that sexualised,     Don Juan porn addiction.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitanot bad
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWell , damn, Michael Fassbender actualy did the fingering in this movie.<br>You know this movie is basicaly connected to Prometheus and Alien Covenant. because this movie is one of many  &quot;dreams&quot; programmed into David by an old Weyland , as part of him displaying and living out his own god complex on his creation David. So right now David is still dreaming aboard the vessel Covenant... as it is traveling faster than the speed of light straight into a black hole that is in the process of devouring a neutron star... and yes the x-men prequel movies with him pretending to be Magneto is just another one of those dreams programmed into him by Weyland... ah love.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitagreat movie, can relate
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaAwsomm movie
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita<b>My favorite movie ever!</b>
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaSteve McQueen kachow??
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitai saw this trailer while watching Limitless. Just before Limitless started. We were stoend out of our minds. Then when I saw the film, I felt a &quot;cinematic jolt&quot; --- absolutely riveting film. The trailer tends to be impossible to make for a film of this nature.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita&quot;Your hard drive is filthy&quot;, How the hell did this movie gain access to my hard drive?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI dated someone like Brandon, he had no soul. You feel sorry for them until you realize they have no guilt and no shame, and are proud of the damage they cause. If they make a girl cut herself out of despair they are flatteredand amused. Sick bastards...
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaoccupational name for a cooper, (standard German Fassbinder) from Middle High German faz ‘cask’, ‘barrel’ + binder ‘joiner’. This is a term used in northern Germany; terms used in other German-speaking regions are Böttcher, Büttner, Küfer, and Schäffler.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a lot of good subtle brilliance in this movie... also, acting is good... but on the surface though, it&#39;s kind of boring.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaI NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWatched this movie in the cinema with my boyfriend, then we went home and we donwloaded it... It was a great experience for both of us! ;)
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaMichael Fassbender is an astounding actor
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaX-Men First Class part 2: &#39;Magneto Rides Again!&#39;
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitasuch a great movie!
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita@nonamerus wow lmao !
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita@xxNawtyDawgxx Unravelling (from the OST) by Harry Escott
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita@PaulDenton14 
Have you not heard that there&#39;s a buttload of full frontal in throughout the movie? Especially Fassbender, male full frontal is a big no-no in the MPAA
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitawhats the song 

Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the music called?
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the prequel of the prequel when magneto used to attract chicks before metal. ;-)
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitatoo much moaning!!!
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitano magneto...NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita@Marseebros yeah just got that lol
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaanal
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita@comedeyzone yeah and by what the description says thats pretty obvious too!!
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaIts about sexual addiction. thats my guess i mean when his boss talked about his hard drive that pretty much says it alll and it&#39;s nc 17 because you probably see everything and they  probably have whole porno scenes. thats my best geuss
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshita0:43 hey that&#39;s the girl from Doctor Who :D
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaWow shocker another sex flick
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaits alright 
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaLooks compelling.  He&#39;s certainly a risk taker.
Op9iQiB_ANIdelimeterByIshitaInteresting.....
MxqsmsA8y5kdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s amazing how the time passes and Harry Potter still provides emotions. Books and movies of my childhood :)

MxqsmsA8y5kdelimeterByIshitamaybe voldemorts face is flat because he ran into the wrong wall at the train station
MxqsmsA8y5kdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the theme used at the very beginning of this clip?  The one before &quot;Glacial Supremacy&quot;?  It&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t know from the Deathly Hallows trailers.

u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to watch the movie, just watch it. Don&#39;t watch the trailer, it&#39;s filled with spoilers.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaDoes somebody now simillar films to this?
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaI would love having such a girlfriend=)
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaSuper underrated movie. And this is a godawful trailer. Way to underutilize the cinematography, silence, soundtrack and symbolism that made this movie spectacular
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaBest Movie
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie, 10s across the board
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaThe music at the end got stuck in my brain, after seeing the movie
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaThank you to The Chemical Brothers to makes such amazing musics for this Amazing movie !
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaloko bier
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaFirst of all, Hanna is beautiful. Second of all, she is fucking badass. Third of all, I watched this movie today. Fourth of all, I will never ever watch another fucking movie but this one.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaFilm nawet o mnie powstał XDD
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies I seen
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaMy nym is hanna
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitais it just me or this looks interesting?
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer really doesn&#39;t do the film any justice
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaAnd that is how you spoil a complete movie in  about 2 minutes.. This trailer, effectively told the whole story in cliff notes. Modern trailers are a disaster.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaفلم مليح
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshita<b>This movie struck me as a child</b>
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaMost disgusting movie i ever watched
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaDer filem Hanna ist ein alte filem und nicht 2011 das ist eine Lüge.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaUm filme maravilhoso!! Lembra um pouco Capitão Fantástico. Ação, drama, ciência, aventura e tudo mais. Vocês não vão se arrepender, o filme é ótimo.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaOMG
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie it was terrible.. Honestly bad
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaHere for Cate 😍
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitathis is (basically) the whole film. Could&#39;ve saved me 2hours and $7 if i&#39;d&#39;ve known!!!
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaBest movie I saw in 2011!!
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaI good movie . I wish the girl was more funny though some how , but still a great movie .
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaHanna is perfect
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaObviously this movie  is infuenced by the 1990 classic Nikita.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaThumbnail tho :d (SHE LOOKS LIKE MORGAN AT THUMBNAIL)
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaVery different movie trailer
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaMusic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u73CLdHpbNk&amp;t=0m14s">0:14</a>?
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaWhat a good movie!
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaI just didn&#39;t like how Eric gets killed by veigler. He never would have made that mistake. Maybe that family should have survived but that&#39;s not realistic. She would have had to get rid of them. There is a scene they shot for the ending that was cut out of the final version. The girl Sophie walks out to get the mail and is handed a post card unmarked of course, and it saysPLANET EARTH on the front. That would have been a pretty cool ending, not as dark as the actual but not as realistic. imo One of my all time top 10 movies though. Shaw shank redemption is my no.1
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaEsse filme aí pra ser Ruim ...prescisa melhorar muitooooo....😎
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaTô assistindo agora na globo
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaja assisti esse filme e vou assistir hoje pela segunda vez que vai passar daqui a pouco na sessão gala no canal da globo aqui no Brasil
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who watched this movie and still doesn&#39;t understand what her aim was?

u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaIf only we had a male protagonist ..
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaterrible trailer for an awsome movie
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaj&#39;ai adorai le film a reregarder
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaThe story, Saoirse Ronan but most of all the way of filming makes this film a peace of true art masterpeace. Unconventional without taking you out of the story. Most artistic meant movies fail to keep you inside the story, this one does a great job. This is one of my top 10 movies of all times. Next to the godfather, the shawshank redemption, Leon and some other great movies, this was the last film that received a straight A or as we say in Europe: &quot;a grade 10&quot; movie, by me.
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaCómo se llama la música al final
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitai think the trailers killed the movie
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaonde posso encontrar o filme completo

u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaI want movies like this any tips<br>
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitaspy kids 4?
u73CLdHpbNkdelimeterByIshitathis is the only trailer in which the sounds and scenes come at the same time lol well done!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitawhat have they done to ciderella?!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaZOMBIES ARE STARTING TO BECOME OVERRATING I MEAN SERIOUSLY THEY ADDED STEROIDS TO THESE ZOMBIES FOR EXTRA SCARE EFFECT?! TO ADD ON TO THAT THEY MESS WITH MY FAVORITE BOOK. YOU UNEDUCATED SQUEAKER HIPSTER SAUCE TURDS NEED TO GET A LIFE!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaBecause fuck even trying to make a good movie. Have more zombies.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this looks stupid. Really she had some kung fu moves?... What in the 1300&#39;s -1500&#39;s? The west barely knew anything of eastern martial arts at the time. This movie is going to flop, not because of strong female roles, but because of how ridiculous it is. I mean look at the trailer...  a Kung fu spinning heel kick...
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOMF <br>HE&#39;S FINALLY GINGER!<br>Like if you know what I mean ;)
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaFuck you.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaAt first I thought this was a joke but then...then...omg I am ok w. this
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaCinderella is kicking ass!!!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOh I get it, it&#39;s another brain dead movie for brain dead viewers.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaTywin and Cersei! :D
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIs this really a thing? Adding zombies to almost anything? Whats next; the Wizard of Odd Zombies?!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWords cannot convey how thrilled I am. I&#39;ve been waiting for this since I heard the news on EW!!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWhen the General Public Finds out this was a Book....based off a Jane Austen Classic.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWhen you go to Fanfiction.net for movie ideas
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI wanted to read this book since forever, and now they&#39;re making it into a movie??<br>Awesomeness!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitahow dare they.... You don&#39;t treat classics like this :(
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaFirst Abraham Lincoln with Vampires, now this. Leave the books alone Hollywood!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitalol oh my
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<b>Ohh. Hello Matt Smith! Since your in this movie, I am surely watching it now!</b> :D
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awful lol
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaElla having courage and not being kind to zombies
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know that this is based off a book? It&#39;s meant to be a laugh, take it for what it is.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOh, fuck dammit! A Medieval zombie apocalypse that came about as a result of the Black Plague?! Come on, man! I thought of that! Can&#39;t I have at least ONE original idea? <b>Sigh</b> Whatever, it&#39;s not like I ever would&#39;ve done anything with it...
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjfmdvLu9c&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> it&#39;s nice to have a doctor in the house
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaFacepalm  <b>Slowly walks away and forgets he saw this</b>
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it takes itself way too seriously. I mean it has such a ridiculous title and concept but the trailer makes the movie seem like it lacks humor. I&#39;m not expecting goofy slapstick comedy but the premise alone is a recipe for hilarity, it&#39;s not meant to be so serious, but maybe that&#39;s the joke, it&#39;s like &quot;dead&quot;pan humor, lol.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaYes. All of my yes.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaRIP headphone users
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitathis shit is gay and retarded with a capital G and R!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaHOLY CRAP MATT SMITH IS IN IT FROM DOCTOR WHOOO WOOOO<br><b>explosion</b><br>ALSO THIS IS SO NEAT <br>OH MY GOD <br>ITS ZOMBIES AND PRIDE AND PREJUDICE! <br>THE MIXTURE THE DRAMA! OH HOW WILL IT IEND?!?!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it, keep on playing kick ass roles ladies!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a stupid movie. The only problem is: Cowboys and Aliens, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter were all &quot;stupid&quot; movies and I thought they were each great. With that in mind, this looks awesome and I will definitely see it!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaomg, when i saw matt smith. i remember reading the book for school, it was awesome
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWho else is here because of Jc Caylen
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOH YEAH!  I CAN HARDLY WAIT.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIf anyone&#39;s looking for the songs name, it&#39;s born to be wild by J2 &amp; Blue Holiday. <br><br>You&#39;re welcome.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOh My God!!! I loved this book so much and this looks sO GOOD!!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIf this takes place just after the plague, why are the English wearing their 18th century red coats?
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t really like the book, but holy shit this looks amazing.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m gonna watch it just for cersei and zombies
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOh my god This combination 👌 
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitawait i dont think a zombie would still carry a baby
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaHang on a second. <b>[checks date]</b> No, it&#39;s not April Fools Day.... Are--are they serious?! O_o
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaMatt Smith!!!!! Ahhhhh!! 👏💖💖
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThey weren&#39;t fucking around.... I remember reading about this movie being made while I was doing research for my AP Lit class on this book.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaYou can tell Zombies have become overdone when the most creative thing people can think of is randomly adding them to classic literature.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaPls no. Pls.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI...what? I mean it looks pretty cool, but why lol?
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaAnd i never thought they could beat the title of &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Slayer&quot;
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit...zombie carrying a baby...that makes sense? This is just a desperate way to make over-sexualized women zombie killers.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWait this is a real thing?!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitathis looks stupid but then again I&#39;m not a zombie fan
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so stupid.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIs this for real?
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThat generic ass scream at the beginning smh
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitawhy is this a real movie
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThe song is awesome.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI never read the book and know that this movie is coming out February mean it&#39;s going to suck.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaAll I saw was Matt Smith
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThe title should be, Pride and Prejudice and Feminism.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThis was a genuinely good trailer.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI wish Jane Austen had some decedents so they could sue for that travesty.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<b>sigh</b><br>Just....why.....
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOh my actual God. This was based off of &#39;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&#39; a cool adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The comment section is being even suckier then usual.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaif this is serious fuck this movie, if this movie is a dark comedy then it has a chance.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI never knew I needed proper ladies killing zombies so bad. I NEED THIS!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaTwo best things ever! Zombies and Medieval times! Looks kinda good. But I don&#39;t know how good they will mix together, haha.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjfmdvLu9c&amp;t=00m58s">00:58</a> So bored. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjfmdvLu9c&amp;t=00m59s">00:59</a> WHAAAAAA?! Apparently we found one of the 11th doctor&#39;s missing episodes!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitathis is bad even for todays horror movie standerds
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<b>Saw the title</b><br>me:  are you serious...<br><b>Clicks the video</b><br>me: are you serIOUs....<br>*gets to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjfmdvLu9c&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a>  *<br>me: oh wait a minute...<br><b>sees the rest</b><br>me: nevermind.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaFor those who do not know,<br>Game of thrones actors always come in pairs<br>Captain America: Walder Frey and Margaery Tyrell for instance<br>Dracula untold: Tywin and Rickon<br>The Last Legion had four.<br>when I see one GOT actor I play a game of spot the other one.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was a joke... it&#39;s real?
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita...This by far the worse DEATH a classic work of literature can suffer.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be honest- yes, it sounds stupid from the title. But to the movies credit, not many zombie movies take place in the olden Times, and it looks totally BADASS!!!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita&quot;Squad Goalz with a Z for zombie&quot; lmao
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thinks this actually looks pretty cool?
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaAwesome. :D
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaLooks so cool
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitasweet had to go to this page and like and share looks fucking awesome yo
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitais this a prank or a joke
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOmg Matt Smith! The doctor is in this movie!
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI. Want. To. See. It. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23feminist">#feminist</a>
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIf Matt smith is in the movie obviously he&#39;s going to be the doctor to save them in this alternate universe
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaIS THIS FOR REAL??? WHAT
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaJane Austen should come back from the dead and eat the flesh of those who ruined her perfect masterpiece
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaFor all you wondering, no this is not another Zombie film. It&#39;s passed off a series of retelling Jane Austen&#39;s classic novels but with a twist. So if you don&#39;t like pride and prejudice then you most likely won&#39;t like this.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaNo no NO! First of, the movie takes itself (in this trailer) way too seriously. What happened to the fun campy nature of the first teaser trailer? Second of all, Matt Smith, one of the reasons I was interested in the film in the first place only shows up for ONE LINE?! It even looks like it wants to rip off the Hunger Games trailer in some ways! In a world full of crappy zombie movies with a few exceptions (Shaun of the Dead and Cooties comes to mind for actual good zombie movies) this one will probably share the same fate that Abraham Linchon: Vampire Slayer did: A stupid concept that takes itself too seriously. Except with ALVS, it actually worked. This? This won&#39;t, can&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t work.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re really playing this seriously, huh? Hopefully the blood isn&#39;t all CGI.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaName of The song????
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjfmdvLu9c&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> DOCTOR WHO 11TH
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH MMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUD matt smith
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaA moment of silence for those that didn&#39;t know about the novel.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s the doctor :D
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita...good god, next they&#39;re going to make a movie out of Romeo &amp; Juliet &amp; Vampires.
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaJ2 ft. Blu Holliday : Born To Be Wild  the song
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaWow I&#39; am wait see you. Thailand
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitadoesn,t this remind anyone of blood borne
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaI am a big zombie fan, pretty obsessed with zombies actually. But this looks like crap
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WOW">#WOW</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23OMG">#OMG</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WTF">#WTF</a>
syjfmdvLu9cdelimeterByIshitaBetter than the previous trailer :D No matter, still going to watch it.
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if it would have been the curious case of michael jackson
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was amazing 😍 ❤️ to me it wasn&#39;t really too emotional like everyone else in the comments seem to have felt  but it did tickle my heart a little at different times.I just didn&#39;t like it when Benjamin was born how everyone called him ugly and how that mfking doc said &quot;some creatures aren&#39;t supposed to live&quot;😤

iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaLadies and gentlemen, that’s the whole movie right there.
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely amazing film! One of Fincher&#39;s Best! The only 2 films that I didn&#39;t like as much from him are : Alien 3 (Which he himself didn&#39;t like the film for many reasons) and Panic Room. But Gone Girl , Fight Club , Seven , The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo , The Social Network , Zodiac and The Game are some of the best films I have ever seen!<br><br><br>If I had to rate Fincher films it would go like this for me :<br><br><br>1)Fight Club<br>2)Seven/Zodiac ( Can&#39;t choose between them ,both Masterpieces in they own ways )<br>3) Gone Girl<br>4) The Curious Case of Benjamin Button<br>5) The Game<br>6) The Social Network<br>7) The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo<br>8) Panic Room<br>9) Alien 3
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaYou are so young.. <br>Only on the outside.. <br><br>That is soo me! I&#39;m done.

iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaThis movie never gets old.<br>Loved the Score, Makeup and acting by all the actors. Fabulous acting by Brad. <br>No words Fincher!! <br>Love from India💕
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this movie in middle school. This was the only Brad Pitt movie I liked.
iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaI watched it exactly 11 years ago on February 14, 2009 in Istanbul 💖📽🎬

iH6FdW39HagdelimeterByIshitaThis, The Social Network and Fight Club are the only non-thrillers Fincher has directed. There&#39;s Alien 3, but Fincher disowned that film so it doesn&#39;t count.

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaThe whole Bourne franchise is better than John Wick lol
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI don’t know how make times I watch these sequels.<br>It dont make no sense😂
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaAmazing trailer :)
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s Go
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaMasterpiece movie
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaFar Out magazine claims Ultimatum is Damon&#39;s biggest regret. That&#39;s laughable, considering that Ultimatum, as bad as it is, is literally 100X better than Dogma, and several other Matt Damon movies!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t regret watching it<br>🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaNetflix.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshita11:48 Am April 17th 2022
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI’m about to watch this movie for the first time
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaThe camera operators on meth moved more than the actors did sometimes. Bullets that turn to a puff of smoke when hitting glass or paint on a vehicle and don&#39;t leave a scratch are all lame in any high budget hollysuck film 😂
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaiPad
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitait&#39;s an action film, and not only that, it&#39;s a political film, showing the rottenness of government, ending the trilogy in a GLORIOUS way, even though it had 2 non-mediocre sequels
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaAaaaaaaaaaah dayum 🤒
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaToday marks 14 years since this movie was released. AMAZING!!👊👊

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaIn the meanwhile the CIA &quot;seems like a great idea, why don&#39;t we have a program like that?&quot;.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaTerrible camera work, can&#39;t finish the movie was so dizzy...... good movie bad camera work...
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI’ll never forget the Paris bic pen incident 🖐 🖊
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaGreat movie if you like preposterous scenes and shaky camera footage. I guess the director felt the scenes wouldn&#39;t be exciting enough, so with many of the scenes the cameraman shakes the camera violently... it can give you a headache, and it&#39;s hard to follow what&#39;s going on. What a bummer.

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaBourne hears  like bond ...  agree ??
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaInteresting movie.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaMan Matt Damon is such an badass in the entire Jason Bourne trilogy.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshita#4 Bourne movie coming out in  2020 called.. wait for it..  Bourne Again Virgin
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaWeapon of mass distorsion
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaWhy did i not find out about this movie sooner? This is real good  -_-
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaif your here after the Peter McKinnon video then ....
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaAny1 here after the PeterMcKinnon vid?
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitathis film is just brilliant gritty n fast paced every move he make is unpredictable excellent writing n direction damn good
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitai remember everything
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the song in the trailer? Is it in the soundtrack?
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI have few memories of this film, I must see it again
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaFirst one is the best, but damn these two Greengrass movies with that shaky cam, and half a second cuts..<br>Exactly the reason why I don&#39;t like them so much.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitachewbacca ass
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaGenial los saludo yo el facha dj pitty Mendoza
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitai watched last night bourne supremacy and it was so great.goona watch bourne ultimatum tonight. super excited..
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaNostalgic
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaMy favorite movie of all time. I liked it better then the first two which were also fantastic.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaOne of the rarest thrillz of all time
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaOne of the best one can make. B U.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitathis was one of the best trilogy ever made and this was the best out of the three cause there was non-stop action which was so cooooooool
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaWhere’s Guillermo?
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaJesus Christ it&#39;s Jason Bourne!!!!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaIt is a shame they cut Julia Stiles character out and It is a good series thou!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaDie Filme werden immer schlechter, zu soft
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaThe Bourne movies are much more mature and darker than most of the Bond movies (with the exception of the dark Bond movies.). Bond is like Superman because he has all the gadgets he uses and Bourne is like Batman because he is hard to find and knows how to find his way out of any death situation without any help. Bond does get some help. It would be possible for Bourne to use anything against Bond such as turning his own gadgets against him.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitagood films
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaJason Bourne: there is a girl who can bring me back... she used to work in Berlin.<br>Pamela Landy: what if i can&#39;t find her?<br>Jason Bourne: Thats easy she&#39;s standing right next to ya.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaForgot how badass this movie was.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitawho else noticed this movie is all about chasing
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitai wonder if it will be as good as the others, damon is getting long in the tooth and no longer the young pretty boy who first signed up for these movies, back in the &#39;good will hunting&#39; days when he was so tight with his &#39;roomy&#39; ben affleck. how far thing have come since those early day
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI love Jicky.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaone of the very best action movie that i have ever seen
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaI thought they were going to have sex after Nicky dyed and cut her hair just like Marie in the first movie, hehe.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaGreat action movie. Maybe the best Jason Bourne. I can&#39;t wait for new Jason Bourne movie. :)
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitathe movie sucks
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaYour votes on my fate are retroactively binding.<br><br>Stop speaking.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitammm, no one knows.  such an amazing song.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaرجاء كيف احصل علئ هذا الفلم...ويتم تحميله لم ينزل الفلم مقاطع...فقط في جميع...اماكن تحميل الافلام رجاء مساعده
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaFirst trailer for Bourne 5 with Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass premieres at Super Bowl 50

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaMan, the people that wrote and made the Jason Bourne trilogy are just geniuses. We all know what happens to most movies that have several sequels one after another, but this one is no disappointment, it is on the same level as the other two previous one, and that is perfect! It doesn&#39;t undermine the previous movies nor does it make it seem overdone. Each movie of the series is an episode. I can&#39;t speak for the fourth movie but I highly suggest you watch all the first three!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s because of Jimmy Kimmel tha i watched Bourne trilogy!! :D<br>F..  you Kimmel!!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaLike for jelly
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitahi
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaname of the music, anyone?
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaBest if not one of the best action/mystery film I&#39;ve seen. :) Such a great writer. :)
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaanother typical movie ,U know the character are God level( maybe could beat Kratos )could dodge every single bullet , die hard.and the bad people also have the same atitude (could not hold single punch)Boring.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaBecause obviously the movie plot isn&#39;t about the character Matt played in the previous 3 movies. Legacy follows the life of a total different character, so it would be weird if Matt Damon also played that role.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaMatt Damon is coming back with Bourne 4 soon!!! :)
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitayesss!!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitais it necessary to watch the previous parts of The Bourne for watching this part???? 
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s that song at around 0:47?
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitashame, it looked badass
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitayeah.....he knows.....he said &quot;There shouldn&#39;t have been a fourth,&quot; not &quot;there isnt a fourth&quot;
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaHow come Matt Daimon didn&#39;t accept the role in the fourth movie?

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitathere is a fourth film, but a different actor thou 

ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitahe is really good at staying alive and trying to kill him and failing just pisses him off lol
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaWorst trailer for awesome movie
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitaloved the whole series 9.9 out of 10 harry potter still my fav lol.
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitano it was dubbed
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitai didn&#39;t know matt damon was such a badass.....
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitai bet you two like twilight...supremacy is awesome idiots !! so is the Bourne trilogy
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitabourne legacy cant even come close to this!!
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitafuck yea, best film, like an energy shake
ZT2ZxjUjSo0delimeterByIshitacool
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaHell yeah!!! Been waiting for this movie for ages!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaPretty cool. The first one was half decent so I&#39;ll probably see this one too. Big comic book fan but I never read the original of this.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaFrom 300 to Sin City it&#39;s all about Eva Green ;)
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI hope this doesn&#39;t suck.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t really care for the first one, too disjointed, it was basically a miniseries in the form of a movie. Had I known that going in it might have left a better taste in my mouth.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqRRF5y94uE&amp;t=0m47s">0:47</a> &quot;That&#39;s Allstate&#39;s stand&quot;
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaChristopher Meloni! Amazing actor! :D
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else remember when this was in takes a few years back and Mickey Rourke said he wouldn&#39;t be in it... Guess he isn&#39;t too good for it anymore.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awful. I don&#39;t mean the subject, I don&#39;t mean the acting, I mean the visuals. It looks like a cheap B-Movie Sin City knock off...what crappened?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaNooooo...not Jessica Alba guess I won&#39;t be watching this film then
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m indescribably excited for this film. i only hope its as good, if not, better, than the original :D
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitai hope Willis is back somehow 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaBest Black And White Movie?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWtf? Devon Aoki not as Miho?!! Dammit
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWhat does he say between <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqRRF5y94uE&amp;t=0m37s">0:37</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqRRF5y94uE&amp;t=0m41s">0:41</a> ?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshita
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaLooks great but will any of the women be able to top Carla Guginos nude scenes from the last flick?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaSong: The Glitch Mob - &quot;Cant Kill Us&quot;
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to seeing Jamie Chung as Miho; but it still won&#39;t be the same without Devon Aoki.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitajessica alba
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaAbout damn time this got done.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer. Frank Miller must have some serious problems with self esteem. His name appears a lot.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWas so excited until the dubstep came on.....Movie is going to be terrible.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaGlitch Mob!!!!!!!!!!!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ma be honest, this looks pretty shitty
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Gaga? 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only going to go see this movie because of JG-L.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Gaga?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWas that josh hartnet voice at the end 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitasong please
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaLooks fuckin&#39; great! i LOVE JGL, but why is the title JGL movie? I wouldnt exactly say it&#39;s his movie?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great. I hope it can live up to the first film.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it look so cheap??? I thought VFX would be much better than the original movie but I see quite the contrary!!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWow The Glitch Mob for the sound track? BANGER
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t it changed to A Dame To Die For?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaBest trailer of the year and best trailer I&#39;ve seem for a 2014 movie so far. It is very possible this is going to be my film of the year. 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqRRF5y94uE&amp;t=00m34s">00:34</a> : Christopher Llyod in the movie ?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaEva Green!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaIf this was in colour it would look like a shiter Phantom Menace.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaand after that, rodriguez, please make new predators movie
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaatlast
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaJessica Alba WOW
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaBout Damn Time LOL at least my boy JGL is in it tho!

nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait:3
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaLiking the footage &amp; feel of the movie, but the trailer....... Scenes from a live action comic-book noir, with glitch hop screeching away over the top of it. They must have a young executive in the marketing department.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitajessica alba would get it

nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaThis thing should have came out years ago. Not that excited about it. It was good to see Marv again however. 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaHot
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaLady Gaga :D 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaBout time they made another!<br>
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitatook them long enough
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitajessica :)
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaBut what if Dame is not kill?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaIt is not a remake. It&#39;s an adaptation of Dame to Kill For, Just Another Saturday Night, and a new story by Miller (the one with JGL). Characters who may have &quot;died&quot; in the first will still be in this one.<br><br>And why would they do a remake with the same actors, writer and director? Jesus Christ.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s gaga
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!! looks freakin sweet!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitai m eagerly waiting for this one
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about damn time!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaAwesome... I loved the first film and this looks brilliant as well..
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitafirst part was better
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaeven the oldboy is on this movie!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks a bit like a remake.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks cool but i&#39;m not sure about it. The first one had Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Quentin Tarantino was part of what made SC great because he has his own unique style that cant be done without him. Regardless I will still go see it but I don&#39;t think it will be the same thing as it&#39;s predecessor.  
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaits about time
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqRRF5y94uE&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a> hell yeah! XD
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaYeah, was the dubstep reaaaallly necessary?
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaanybody getting a glitch mob vibe from the song?<br>Also ... HOLY JESSICA ALBA!!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaThe dustep is so out of place.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M NOT SURE IF I&#39;M GONNA LIKE THIS BUT I DID LIKE THE FIRST ONE SO IMMA GIVE IT A SHOT.
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaFinally after almost 10yrs!!!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaplease don&#39;t f**k it up... please don&#39;t f**k it up... pleeeeeeeeease don&#39;t f**k it up
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaSong name : The Glitch Mob - Can&#39;t Kill Us
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaNooooo Dubstep noooo!!!!!!!!!! Shit!
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaI don’t understand, i thought this was a prequel but feels like sequel …lol rhymes 
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaWhat drugs did i take before i saw this trailer
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaRIP Michael Clarke Duncan and Brittany Murphy<br><br>hope this movie does the original justice

nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t let this suckk
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitaCould suck. Could be good. With Miller And Rodriguez, You&#39;re never sure anymore.

nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitasecond
nqRRF5y94uEdelimeterByIshitafirst
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaCGI looks a little unfinished, so hopefully thats fixed.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaObviously the president will survive. It&#39;s just boring when you already know the ending no matter how much they spice up the story.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaPQP parece ser MUITOOOO foda, e com atores incríveis ! \õ ansiosa !
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaWait where is Channing Tatum?
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaIsis did it
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaThe best thing about the trailer was Harvey Dent..!!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t worry, 007 will save London
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for Big Ben Down
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitathe President will not die. end of the story.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaNorth Korea has Fallen
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaUh wow I didn&#39;t even know they were making a sequel to Olympus Has Fallen.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaThat Advance Warfare music tho!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaI like how the voice of God says &quot;Oh my God&quot;. lol
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaFor real tho??? A sequel??? Lol
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaThis is so ridiculous
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshita*Prime Minister running away from explosions: &quot;Whose bloody idea was it to privatise all of our national security?!&quot;<br><br>Michael Fallon MP &quot;Eeeerrrmm, but we needed to fund our Eton friends in Switzerland without cutting profit margins...&quot;
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaThreaten our freedom? Puh-leez!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaYou can&#39;t have a trailer without the BWAAAAAAS!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitapropaganda film for the War against terror.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaThis is getting way too ridiculous!!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaهلا بالعيال
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitafirst one was great can they do it for the second
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD!

3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh america is the 1 terrorist in the world america will destroyed very soon
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaAn other movie about Murica: heroes vs enemies!? smh !!! I think I&#39;ll go back to watch anime..
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaAfrica has fallen coming soon.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why, but I love the first one, not a perfect action film, but extremely bad ass. The trailer looks like it&#39;s going to be an even more over the top action fest, and that&#39;s why I love it! Hope it doesnt suck!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshita:D great!!  I am going to watch this xD the day before i am going to london on vacation lol
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaIs this Olympus Has Fallen Part 2?

3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaDr. Pavel Rises
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaHarvey dent and Leonidas vs the world 😂
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaAlways an american who is trying to save the day.<br>pretentious assholes
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshita&quot;Ah mah gawd&quot;
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaAnd only the American president matters, well thats just logic. ...
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaYay. A film based in the UK but is basically arse locking the US president and constitution. I could not come up with a shitter idea for a film even if I tried. Also no one cares about the British Prime Minister or fellow European Leaders. The only person in the world we need to care for is the US President. Stupid, stupid, stupid film.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaWOW what&#39;s with all the trailers coming out this week, Alice through the looking glass, kung Fu panda 3, the hateful 8 and tomorrow we get the war craft trailer, soo many good films coming out next year, so excited!!!

3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s not the sequel to white house down. it&#39;s the sequel to &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; jeeeshhhh. some people!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman: We will find you and will destroy you<br><br>Liam Neeson: I will find you and will kill you
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe after all that, they still didn&#39;t made Morgan Freeman the president...
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitathey did a sequel to that load of sh*t?
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitadisappointing cgi.<br><br>and where the hell are the british forces? they&#39;re in london for crying out loud. there are more american troops then the british in british soil?
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaTokyo Has Fallen. Paris Has Fallen. Winchestertonvilleville Has Fallen. The possibilities of sequels are endless
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitathis looks retarded and these special effects are terrible
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaso its still got a USA hard on even when it&#39;s set in London? meh.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitacrappy cgi......AGAIN
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaLooks action packed but I hope they didn&#39;t show it all in the trailer.

3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaGood, good.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaI want to hate it but it actually looks like a fun action movie XD
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaDamn isis leader has a nice suit
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshita&#39;Murica: The Movie
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaObviously Morgan freeman is smarter than the actual president in the White House down universe. So make him president already 😂😂😂
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a decent action flick.
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaWe will find you. <br>And we will destroy you...
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaLame idea!
3AsOdX7NcJsdelimeterByIshitaGood guy helicopters, doing what they&#39;re supposed to do at movies.

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThis doesn&#39;t look good.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitapretty gorgeous cinematography

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshita300s trailer was waaaay sicker. This was meh but I&#39;ll still fork over the $17 to see it.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaCersei doesn&#39;t look at all like Cersei 
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaEva Green is the women you see in this movie&#39;s trailer. While Cersei in Game of Thrones (Lena Headey) is not. Jeez...
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitadead. Where have you been?
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaWTF? where&#39;s Leonidas???????????????????????????
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaAhhhhhh they why would they release the trailer this early? They&#39;re clearly just teasing us! Why can&#39;t they publish the movie during summer???
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitayou&#39;re talking about a completely different person
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitashe wasn&#39;t Joffrey&#39;s mom when 300 came out
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitalol its not this happens at the same time as 300
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitatheir armor is different in this one 2/10

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaLOVE LOVE LOVE ♥ ♥ ♥ GORGEOUS SULLY!!!!!! I WANNA LICK HIM SO BAD
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaOh shit im tripping balls 
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaEva Green looks hot as hell in this.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaI can see that, but let&#39;s not forget that she was queen of Sparta before being a Lannister.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Eva Green,she&#39;s not in Game of Thrones.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaCersei, your brother Jamie Lannister can&#39;t save you...lol anywhoo! this movie looks interesting! Ill see it anyway!
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaOMG WOW! OMG OMG OMG.

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThis shit look crazy insane yo
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaTrue But I still cant look at her face without thinking about the fucked up shit she did In Game of Thrones 
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaUnfortunately a rabid wolf ran up to him on his left side and he just didn&#39;t see it coming. Trust me, I&#39;m just as disappointed as you are.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up to that part where he rides the horse through the water and jumps on another boat. Thanks Mr. Snyder!
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not a Prequel, look at the &quot;Gods&quot; Face, he has a Scar on his Cheek from Leonidas&#39; Spear
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshita2014 fml...
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThis is Spaaaaaaaartaaaa!!!
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s her actor, yes, but you seem to be getting angry at the actor for acting. 
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaokay it looks pretty epic but they do a really shit job of showing who the main characters are...I mean seriously who the Fuck are we supposed to be rooting for loool??
I personaly hope xerxes is the main character a bit of a strange lead but strange can be good.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitanice

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaThis is a prequel.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshita2:08 kick

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Superman doing there? 1:23
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitathis one is taking place before, during, and after the events of the 1st one
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaNo he is not. He is alive a year after 300 &gt;_&gt;
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitalooks cool!

2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitano it&#39;s not, this is going to be the naval battle that ultimately ends Persia&#39;s advance on Greece.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitawhat a beautiful piece of music!!!! &quot;Imperatrix Mundi&quot; by Jo Blankenburg / Position Music
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they have to choose Joffrey&#39;s mom to play this god damn role 
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitaWell said!......what does that have to do with this? Cersei isn&#39;t in this.
2zqy21Z29psdelimeterByIshitathe music is called &quot;Imperatrix Mundi&quot; by Position Music trailer music company, composed by Jo Blankenburg from album &quot;Vendetta&quot; and is available for public to buy.

EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDGYVFZxsXQ&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a> watch dogs 2 anyone?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitathis film  shock me why the heros of this film dont visit embassade of country.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitabetter than fallout
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaOverrated. Better than Abrams&#39; crap but I don&#39;t like the characters besides Ethan, Benji and Brant....
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitamission impossible trailer are too good I love it
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita“Who are you really, Brandt?”<br>“I’m Hawkeye.”
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like fallout as much as i like ghost protocol
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaEMINEM’s music will never ever get old.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaRoad To MI : Fallout <br><br>Mission Impossible ✅<br>Mission Impossible 2 ✅<br>Mission Impossible 3 ✅<br>Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol <br>Mission Impossible Rogue Nation <br>Mission Impossible Fallout
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita2018?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitastill the best one imo
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s never getting old 🤔
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaHere is the Ultraviolet / VUDU  Digital Copy Code for whoever uses it first.    WLMR7HHH94AT
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI remember when COD MW2 used this song... Back in 2009. lol.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita1.51,yeah!!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaOMG!! I remember watching this trailer repeatedly back in 2011 when i was a 14 year old kid. I still get  goosebumps watching this trailer .
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaTom you always look better with layered shoulder length hair. Your future missions see you with it short and it just ages you. Cheers
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita2018?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitathis was my favourite mission impossible
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaU.S. tryna act better than Russia LMAO not gonna happen ma white foos
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaONE OF THE BEST TRAILERS EVER.....
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI love all the mission impossible movies tom cruise all the mission impossible movies all the best tom cruise made but I think mission impossible 6 fallout might be a better mission than any other mission that the last mission impossible and it might be the better mission because hernary cavil is in I cannot wait because Ethan is fighting Superman that a better mission because henary ciliivil is in it that’s why can wait to see it this Friday coming up
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait to see fallout😍😍😍😍😍😍
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaLadies and Gentlemen Brad Bird&#39;s first action movie.. What a movie
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaThe best Mission.. Yet!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitanice
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhats the eniem song?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhy are people joking about there being no ghosts when &quot;ghost protocol&quot; has nothing to with ghosts other than the name?<br>It&#39;s an actual thing that&#39;s sometimes done to deny involvement with some sort of secret intelligence. I could mention times when it has actually been needed in real life, but I&#39;m lazy and don&#39;t want to do any more research than looking up the definition.....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDGYVFZxsXQ&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> - &quot;Who are you really, Brandt?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My real name&#39;s Clint Barton, and I&#39;m actually really good with a bow and arrow. The Avengers kinda threw me out&quot;.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWatching this in 2018!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaBest MI Film till now.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaplot twist: there are no ghost in this movie... just Tom Cruise scaling Burj Khalifa and running away for sandstorm...
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitathe best mission impossible yet
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaBurj Khalifa scene is entralling ever to watch. Mindbloggling and epic scene. Tom Cruise &lt;3 👌👍👏
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaEminem sounds like choking centipede.  I would pay anything not to hear his voice again.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s film name ?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaghost protocol means
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhoever made this trailer got a bonus because this movie was so popular and made bank!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaIf only trailers were made like this! I bought the whole set on Blu Ray cause of this trailer and got a free ticket to this movie. <br><br>Man I still love this movie and to me this is the best trailer of all time!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaNice trailer but can anyone tell me the Song sang by Eminem
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fawad">#fawad</a> Khan instead of Tom cruise .. Tom is overrated real actor fawad ... Hollywood if u want an real actor and an investment like 0 investment and all profit take fawad Khan in mi5 u will be blessed by Allah that u took him one movie an billionaire for lifetime... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fawadfortom">#fawadfortom</a>
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI still have yet 2 see this movie.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaloved knowing lea seydoux is here 😍
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaMr ghost protocol mi4
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI know the Kremlin blew up but wtf the rest of the movie is about, I don&#39;t know. Gun shots and Eminem I guess.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita“Who are you really?” “That’s Jason Bourne...’s less cool cousin.”
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaSoooo good 😊🔥💯
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaLoved this trailer!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaEven after 6 years this trailer and the song&#39;s giving me chills ... Em all the way.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitabest movie i never seen before
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitarunny Dow the  tallest building in the world
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaEATHEN HUNT
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaNot selling me Budapest as Russia, sorry guys.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitauhh where is Luther?...
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaSuper super
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitathis was good!!!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaNot many people that make trailers seem to understand that making a good trailer is almost as much an art form as the movies themselves.<br><br>This... this was a good trailer.  I was sold immediately.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI guessed it right, Jeremy Renner can&#39;t be just some nerdy analyst...
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaGood trailer.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks amazing but I actually came here for the music. go Em!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWatching this trailer, still gives me a chill!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaTom Cruise is amazing! I hope he has a better publicist than his sister this time....
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhat movie you vote for 007 or mission impossible I vote 077
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaawsome some
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie can&#39;t go wrong with Jeremy  Renner involved!!! He&#39;s the best :)
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitayes
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaLove the Eminem song. It just adds that much more &quot;bad&quot; into the trailer. It&#39;s so fitting c: &amp; at least they didn&#39;t completely wipe out the MI theme. Putting it towards the end makes it even better because you&#39;re reminded of what this movie is and its legacy.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita@movieclipsTRAILERS obviously the classic from the tv show,its so spy-agent like
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI would have been pissed if they didn&#39;t add the MI theme in at all but luckily it came at the end.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer will self destruct in five seconds.
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaSuper duper awesome....blue is glue...red is ....dead !
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaawesome
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the nice car that they use 
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita/watch?v=A5bmUMVkR78
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaBoycott that braniwashed wacko scientologist bastard!!!!
Learn what scientology is all about!!!

Not hard anymore, all over the net!
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshita@movieclipsTRAILERS I think it takes M.I into a new, more modern era. I like it :)
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaDo you like the Eminem song?

... or do you think there should have been more of the classic theme?
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaFirst !
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaWanne see Tom Cruise kick some ghosts ass
EDGYVFZxsXQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait.

K0eDlFX9GMcdelimeterByIshitaWoah, this movie was really great. The characters, staffs, producer, director and everything was all fine and they really did this well. This movie really has a sense and you can gain a lot of good message to this. Aamir Khan &amp; Kareena Kapoor was nice couple in this movie. I really had a great time watching to this. I want to share my feelings when I was first watched this. They deserved everything that they have achieved. Congratulations!

K0eDlFX9GMcdelimeterByIshita@MrThePachuco dear misterthepachuco, REALLY? because the only thing i see that seems sick is your stupid comment and to me the only gay thing around is that stupid youtube name of yours. i was a hater to until i ACTUALLY WATCHED IT! if i were to guess anything about you, i would guess you judged this movie by just watching the trailer then telling all your friends you watched it and called it lame. if you wish to see the most gay thing ever, i suggest you find a mirror and look at your gay face

1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitai want a hitgirl movie!
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaomg morgab freeman

1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaThe nerd has six pck
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaIs there gonna be kick-ass 3 ? Chloe Grace Moretz is so beautiful ! I&#39;m really inlove with her since 2007 ! I&#39;ve watched all her movies ! Hehe ! :D
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaNot really, but if the character the real person is playing as is holding a gun the real person is also holding the gun. 
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaUh oh. Now Hit Girl is in the age of consent. Well, in some states and countries anyway. This will get fuckin&#39; (pun intended) interesting.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaTheres a dog on your balls
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant film, gotta say absolutely awesome gotta say. But violent as hell!
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaHit girl dies...

Naw I&#39;m just fucking wit ya.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaWOOT JIM CARREY 
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaMan you really don&#39;t get acting do you? Sure a real person is playing. but they are channeling a fictional persons thoughts and ideas that was written on paper. Acting is about being someone else fake or not. With that said, ever actor who has played a slave owner in movies, you must think they like slavery now huh?
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaLOL.
Hahaha.. Yeah there&#39;s a dog on your balls haha!

lookin forward to this!

1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaNo, because there is a real live person playing as the character. Just like a porn star is a real person, not a drawing. Not that I have anything against hentai, it is a lot more exotic.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaI could of SWORN I saw robert downey jr. near the end &gt;:D
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaBut it&#39;s a &quot;fictional&quot; character That character is just as real as a drawing on my sketchbook.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaSuper healing, is his power.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaIt is not a book, or cg, he is a real person playing as the character.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaFuck u jim carrey its one good way to ruin ur career

1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitait still encourages it lol
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaact like a bitch you get slaped like bitch
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaHow does he glorify them exactly? By his character holding one? So now every time you have a gun in a movie you are glorifying them?
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s also a movie....
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaNo it&#39;s colonel stars and stripes with a gun. He is ACTING. He is playing a character in a fictional world with fictional characters.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitadid not notice that was jim carrey!!! now i&#39;m extra hyped
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitai see what you did there.... ;)

1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaBecause all nerds have a six pack... 
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitathe VHS mode is awesome!
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaFinally McLovin got a mustache.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care if this is gonna be rated R. I will see this shit. XD I&#39;m 14 and I&#39;ve seen an R rated movie before. Btw, Carrey&#39;s gonna be great in Kick-Ass 2.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitawait a secend red mist was not in this movie now red mist is the mother ######
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaอย่าด่าตูนะ
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitahis voice to! going to be great:)
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaEven the green band trailer was funny.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitafinally a decent villain and hero movie to watch. im tired of batman, superman and spider man movies being released every 8 months...
ill be sure to catch this on the big screen :D
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshita&quot;GAME ON COCK SUCKERS!&quot;
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaNoice
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaJim Carrey is a full of shit probably just like pissing people off.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaI hope they take the time to make the green screen effects look a little less...green screen. While they&#39;re at it, I hope they take the time to make those &quot;explosions&quot; look a little less CGI. 

The original Kick-Ass is one of my favorite movies of all time. I&#39;m REALLY hoping the sequel will be good, but the fact that it comes from a guy who directed two movies that everyone&#39;s forgotten about by now worries me.
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitayesssss
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitathe trailer looks a bit mweh, I hope the actual film is as good as the first one
1zcMLxIuuwwdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT *___*

FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaOMG BRITT&lt;3333333
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaSong?
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshita I love how they put Waiting Game by Banks in at the beginning even though the people who made the movie most likely don&#39;t know what the songs about they probably just put it in because they thought it sounded the theme of the movie
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaHey, could anybody tell me the names of the songs they used in the trailer? They&#39;re incredible. 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m totally in LOVE with the cast! 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaUgh Scott Eastwood why do you have to be so sexy??
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaMust watch movie OUO
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaBanks and hozier💕💕💕
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaLetters from April 10, 1940 and the film releases April 10. ;)
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait to see it! its a sexy love story! love it!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the first song they play
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaOmg that&#39;s Melissa benoist!!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaSo we have the son of Clint Eastwood,  a nephew of Angelica Huston, and the great granddaughter of the iconic Charlie Chaplin, fascinating! 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS NOT HOW IT HAPPENED IN THE BOOK. AT ALL.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaThe first song was on The Originals! I knew it sounded familiar.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitathis looks really good. i really want to see it!!!!!!!!:)
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitai am sooooo ready to see it, it is going to feel like forever until i see 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks so good, i have to pick up the book and read it before the movie, love all of Nicholas Sparks&#39;s books, and movies, everyone looks better than the last, saw The Best of Me a few months ago, now can&#39;t wait for this one, as always amazing, one of the best authors of all time
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m assuming the young couple gets married at some point judging by the clip of the guy with a wedding band? ....shocker....
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaactually, i want to clarify my statements about the two main actors. i don&#39;t know at this point. they do seem to lack the emotional depth and explosiveness of &#39;the notebook&#39; &#39;s two main actors. but maybe the people making this movie decided that this is the better choice.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitawell, i guess nicholas sparks found out people like the notebook so much he decided to write another one just like it. but that is a VERY good thing in the case. i was hoping for such. the only problem here is in the less than average acting by the two main characters. and their innocence and looks leaves something to be desired. as far as best scenes go, what is hitting home best with me and many, MANY others is the switching back and forth from a couple&#39;s love in the past to a couple&#39;s love in thr resent and showing the parallel bewteen the two. it shows the timeless resiliency of love, up front.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaThe only films I&#39;ve enjoyed are The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Dear John. But I think I might like this one too.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaBend In The Road needs to be made into a movie. Also, Britt Robertson your already dating Dylan O&#39;Brien really not fair you get to make out with Scott Eastwood.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaHGFJDSKLDBVHDJKAVBDSGFHDSJVS THIS LOOKS SO GOOD I AM SO EXCITED
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaSong names? The male singer sounds like Hozier but what about the girl? 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaHey y&#39;all the name of the song called work song by hozier
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI met the celebrities they show in the trailer and the movie!! I even got a picture with them!

FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be a good movie😎
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaOh. My. Gosh! WAITING GAME BY BANKS! I LOVE THAT SONG! Great Song Choice! :-) :-D
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s The second Song
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaVery american soapy stuff but I like it I guess somehow.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaFinally ! I&#39;ve seen the trailer ! Wowww ! It will be next amazing movie from Nicholas Sparks ! So, we are waiting for April ! 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitai already finished the book and i love it.   i cant wait for the movie &lt;3

FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good 😍
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait until this movie comes out ❤️
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitacant wait to see this movie but I will scott eastwood britt roberston did one hell of a mighty fine job well done to both of them
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI bet they could really care less what anyone thinks about this movie! It is going to be a hit weather you like it or not! Get over yourself
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaName of the song please 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI really loved the trailer, but I really hate the music they chose. They don`t really blend with the story and what it is about. I read the books and I totally loved it, but for those who haven`t the music, the type of scene mad like all cloudy and mysterious, dark. It´s not useful. Change the music please!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the song is called? 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshita1st song is banks- waiting game 2nd is Hozier- work song
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m totally seeing that when it comes out!!!!!!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaGot to love them cowboys!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaSophia Danko!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaAngie from Under the Dome!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshita<br>
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaThat there&#39;s an EASTWOOD boy! 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaI love this song!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that&#39;s playing?? 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the song is thats playing in the first 45 seconds?
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaare they still trying to recreate THE NOTEBOOK? you can&#39;t do it with shitty script and all the actors look like they just went through make over and have personal hairstylist. 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P. Rango.
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaNot a big Sparks fan (his stories are essentially all the same) but Scott Eastwood is hot and the cowboy thing is pretty sexy. Reminds me of the movie 8 Seconds in a way. Will probably have the same ending. I am definitely interested in seeing it even if I don&#39;t think it will be a great movie. 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaGoodness gracious, Scott Eastwood is so fine! 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaIT LOOKS SO GOOD
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaOh god not another Nicolas Sparks movie. 
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!! Love Nicholas Sparks, can&#39;t wait &#39;til April
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshita2nd
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing! I can&#39;t wait!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome job!  Go NC Film Crew!!! Gotta love Wilmington, NC aka Wilmywood baby!
FUS_Q7FsfqUdelimeterByIshitaHave you seen the new trailer for The Longest Ride? Tell us which scene you’re most excited to see in theaters!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAh, I&#39;m so excited for this movie it&#39;s ridiculous! A great cast - I can&#39;t wait to see it.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s my friends dad singing
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited for this movie. can someone please tell me what&#39;s the name of the song at the start?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI cry when she cries... her acting is so good in this movie. As a foreigner, I can relate so much to her.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the movie and enjoyed it so much that first thing I did was see the trailer to get a glimpse again. great acting and really sweet.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaMolly and Bill Weasley and Horace Slughorn, I wanna watch this.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaIreland and America? She makes the wrong choice, then. The right choice is Sweden.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a real contender at the Oscars
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse Ronan movies are amazing. Byzantium, How I live now, The lovely bones, The Host (yeah, even that movie)...
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI have been in love with Saoirse Ronan since I watched Hanna. She deserved an Oscar Nom that year, she was so good in that movie. Hit a slight speed bump with that garbage The Host,but I hope to see more her in more movies like this and Grand Budpest, such an amazing actress.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAre you kidding me!? Saoirse Ronan and Emily Bett Rickards, count me in!!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaHEY ITS FELICITY!!!!!!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitatočno tako
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this film. All the reviews are positive. All the awards for Saoirse!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse is wow!  She has grown to such a beautiful woman.  So talented.  I loved her since Atonement.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI heard they did a different end that the one in the book ! OH NO i love it as it is :(
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse Ronan for an Oscar 2k16!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaa wee bit sappy but b&#39;jesus i&#39;m going to the phil-em
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitadamn, she looked great in that old-timey bathing suit.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitasuch a lovely novel.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse Ronan, a fantastic underrated and a beautiful actress. I hope she remains to stay classy and never change. An amazing list of castings in this movie. Can&#39;t wait to watch ! Imo,  I think one of the Gleeson actor brothers could be the future James Bond.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaill watch anything with saoirse ronan in it! she&#39;s breath taking
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitawow I really wanna see this film - feels very realistic but still with a tone of Old Hollywood charm :)
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse Ronan! <b>_</b><br>One of the most talented and beautiful actress now!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaOh Saoirse Ronan, how time goes fast... from city of ember, lovely bones, the host, and now this. I&#39;ve never miss a film of yours since I was 8 years old.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing, get wait for it to come out
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like I won&#39;t be watching it, since the trailer  spoiled it already.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaorise Ronan is definately due for another Oscar nom... its been 8 years since she was nominated for &quot;Atonement.&quot; Can&#39;t wait to see her in this beautiful looking film.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWell, that was fucked up !!!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaYes :)
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaJlaw is wack!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaoh thank God! a great actress that hasn&#39;t been forced to play the hooker role yet, get it done Ronan
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaGave away everything but the ending..
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaYear 12 English brought me here
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWell, now I know what Saoirse Ronan is up to. Of all the young actresses her and Mia Wasakowska are my favorites.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this - it looks amazing!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitadammit i wanna read tthe novel to find out did she stay in ireland or go back to brooklyn
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a good film!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWHAT WILL SHE DO???!!!!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI read the book a few years ago, and the trailer looks just like what I imagined! Of course, Nick Hornby never disappoints &lt;3
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a really interesting movie, and Saoirse grew up to be a beautiful young woman--just gorgeous.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaChoose me! =D
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitafor those asking, song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15syDwC000k&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a> is In This Shirt by the Irrepressibles
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaabout time! 😊
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaabout time! 😊
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer just told me everything that&#39;s gonna happen in the movie, looks boring and generic
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaMan... 40 seconds and I&#39;m already bored.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaOh the feels it makes me sad and want to see the movie even more. It seems so touching, heartwarming, sad, and happy all in one! -JSB200
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaITS BILL WEASLEY
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSaoirse is such an incredible actress. She doesn&#39;t get enough credit.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAhhh! I&#39;m stoked!
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer appears to show the whole movie. All that&#39;s left is details
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI happen to agree with this that Saoiris is a very talented young lady. I wish her the best and a great future in hollywood. And I hope she doesn&#39;t get to big of a star that she will be backlashed, she just stay the way she is at this point in her life
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitadid anyone else see the first 5 seconds and immediately think &quot;titanic&quot;
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve searched for hours trying to find the name of the song at the start. All I found was the name of the singer Iarla Ó Lionáird.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSadly it won&#39;t play were I am but I like Saoirse Ronan this looks really great! I will wait until the DVD comes out. :)
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAhh!!!! I can&#39;t wait until this comes out!!! Anyone know when it&#39;s release date in the US will be??
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaCan I get some more green in the shots?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI kept waiting for her to kick someone in the face as loud techno music startsblaring as government assassins surround her.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAnother Academy Award nomination for Ms. Ronan
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaIs this the first time we hear Saoirse speaking her (perhaps even real) Irish accent in a movie? Anyway, this film looks nice, and I will always try to watch any movie starring Saoirse Ronan that I can find..
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThanks for cutting down the movie in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15syDwC000k&amp;t=2m37s">2:37</a>, I no longer need to see it.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in love with Saoirse Ronan!There I said it.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaBy Nick Horny...
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the Irish music at the start?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWhat music in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15syDwC000k&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a>? So beautiful
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAnyone here knows that song that the old man is singing its so great
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a wonderful movie, I&#39;m looking forward to it ^_^
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThis movie gonna rock...love u saoires ronan
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t this a book?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful singing at the beginning like soooooooo beautiful 😍😍
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what this songs called?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaMARRY ME  SAOIRSE
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshita
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWHAT! There are no Blacks in this movie? What a Racist Film :)<br><br>j/k ;D
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;The Irrepressibles-In this shirt&#39;&#39;..for those who will ask about the song.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWait why was she crying when she got the letter from home?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like she put on some weight for the role
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song he&#39;s singing?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaNo need to go see this movie in the theater I just watched the whole thing in this trailer.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI heard that they originally cast Rooney Mara. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with Mara, but when one of the biggest 21-year old stars of the moment is Irish and one of the biggest Irish stars is 21 and Hollywood suddenly has a character who is a 19 year old Irish woman, it seems like a sin of sorts not to cast Saoirse. I&#39;m so glad they did.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI read this book in high school. I am so excited to see it as a movie, especially with Saoirse playing the lead.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this! Saoirse Ronan is such a talented actress. I wish she&#39;d get the attention Jennifer Lawrence does.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible! Haven&#39;t been this excited for a movie in a long time. Can&#39;t wait to see it. :)
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaIts about time that we will be able to enjoy another clean,very touching love story. Saoirse Ronan is very talented actress
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaA film with our beloved &quot;Felicity&quot; Emily Bett Rickards... a must see.
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitathe girl from lovley bones?
15syDwC000kdelimeterByIshitaI know I&#39;m already here for one person and one person alone..... Emily Bett Rickards !!!

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIs this a real trailer well it looks alot like scenes from snow white and hutman with alice and wonderland not very orignal aleast disney did better w this then that return to oz crap.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaA remake is a reboot is a reimagining. As long as there&#39;s brand recognition, it&#39;ll be turned into anything by Hollywood.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaYeah i somehow heard what is going on in the movie (read entire thing) :P Major Plot Spoiler: So Oscar (Oz) comes to Oz with - storm\twister just like Dorothy did in original one. He meet&#39;s Theodora kinda nice witch (Kunis) which at the end becomes wicked witch of west. These two fall in love but Theodora&#39;s sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) prevent&#39;s and forbids that and make Theodora think that Oz is imposter or bad guy and etc...
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaBaum Brothers Circus!
(L. Frank Baum)
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIs this all you can do people if you don&#39;t have an answer on something that someone misspelled wrong? Correct the words out and tell us that we have to learn English? Grown up - no one is perfect... Like you never did or told something wrong - give me a break
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThe ending creeped me out. @_@&#39;
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThis is a prequel to that movie. It is about the rise of the Wizard in OZ.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshita Where is Dorothy, the tin man, the lion and the scarecrow?
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco???? Blehhhhhh
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaCan we sort &quot;his&quot; out? ....
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThis&#39;ll be the first of a series. The announced it like 2 years ago. It&#39;s supposed to be like 9 movies total, very loosely based on the books, (Dorothy will probably be a larger character overall) and Disney&#39;s hoping to capitalize on the gap left by WB wrapping up Harry Potter. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitahectic

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitayup, got to see!
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshita@grrfukk they look so alike...at least in the trailer
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWas it Jennifer Lawrence the blonde one talking at the end?
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve loved The Wizard of Oz since I was a little boy and now they are doing this? I&#39;m beyond excited! Plus, anything with Mila Kunis in it I&#39;ll be there! I can&#39;t wait to see her in the green makeup. If she&#39;s playing the Wicked Witch of the West I&#39;d assume that&#39;s her at the end.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaTrailer looks exactly like Alice in Wonderland.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNo, I have not read the original books, I was just speaking from the Wicked aspect of it :) 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI am SO excited for this! 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIt will becoming out I think in 2014

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNo.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s sad that so many people now consider &quot;Wicked&quot; to be the standard. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused why everyone is comparing this to Wicked. Yes, set in the same world, some shared characters. But Wicked was written recently by Gregory McGuire.  This new movie is an adaptation based on multiple elements from the original L. Frank Baum books. No comparison.  Timeline wise, this new one is first. Also, please remember that the name &quot;Elphaba&quot; is NOT Oz canon.  It was made up by McGuire from the initials of Baum (L F B - El pha ba).  Oz canon = 4 witches, North South East West.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaTHANK YOU!!   It&#39;s hard to find so few who agree with that assesment.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaSo... he lands in... Tim Burton&#39;s version of Wonderland? 

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWheres Zach Braff?
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNot a fan of the art design in alice and also in this movie, i think they should have kept the style adapted from the original, atleast should have changed it from the way alice in wonderland was made.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaOMFG the green goblin and oz I agree they shouldve used a new guy for oz but the witches are fine mila kunis may be good for the wicked witch but I&#39;m not feeling it
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitain wicked there were only 3 witches, Elphaba, Nessarose and Glinda. AAAND the wizard came to OZ after the witches were born, he took power from the Ozma regent I believe right after the birth of elphaba or right before. The witches were not full &quot;witches&quot; if you still want to call them that. Until they grew up AFTER going to school together. so the Wizard came first... I guess.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitayou are a moron, have you read Wicked?
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitahow vapid.

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitanoooo, Wicked was written be Gregory Macguire, he took a very creative spin on the wizard and Elphie. I loved Wicked but it has nothing to do  with the original series in the sense that the characters are completely different. Wicked is the first book of a series of books that are loosely influenced by L.Frank Baum&#39;s original characters.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI read something about Wicked becoming a movie, but it&#39;s still years away. Apparently it&#39;s coming out in 2014.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai wouldnt expect any of these actors to be in this movie. looks good tho. lol
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI predict this to be the prequel to a newly imagined &quot;DOROTHY&quot; that will take the place of &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;, followed by a new land at the California Adventure called &quot;The Land Of Oz&quot;. Mark my words.


_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco ^.^ 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good, just happy that Tim guy didn&#39;t make this film
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWouldn&#39;t this technically be the prequel to Wicked? Since this is how the wizard came to Oz wouldn&#39;t it be Oz the Great and powerful, Wicked, &quot;Wonderful&quot; Wizard of Oz??&lt;/:/
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait! I&#39;ve been meaning to read some of the original books, so I&#39;m excited to see what details they pull from them. :D
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThat looks great!  Can&#39;t wait to see  it.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIKR! They just need to get the obc back together and professionally shoot them doing the show and put that into theaters&lt;/:)
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWhy  do i have the strangest feeling this is going to be inacruate with Wicked? &lt;/:/
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai dont see any good sign.maybe thats the sign for a good movie.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m reading the wicked years right now, so this is really exciting! i know this is based on the original book, so it won&#39;t have elphaba or liir or anything, but oz is a magical place and that&#39;s effing great. this looks interesting.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIts a prequel, meaning this movie comes before wizard of oz, so Dorothy hasn&#39;t came yet.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaim glad tim burton isn&#39;t doing it. his stuff is getting a little old, besides he would have just thrown johnny depp in, same old same old
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s dorothy?

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI love you...
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaCoolio Hoolio
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s only a matter of time when they make a sequel. That is when it get&#39;s interesting.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks good, but I kept thinking that I was watching the trailer for Alice in Wonderland. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaAre you also going to wonder why Meg is Theodora? I am certainly going to get lost in Oz! lol
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThe imagery is beautiful.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitano, you saw james franco.

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaBy that i mean the remake &#39;Charlie and the chocolate factory&#39; sucked. not &#39;Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory&#39;
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaSUPER EXITEDDDDD
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaLOL you mean the Hobgoblin....
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaO_O OuO :D :DDDD
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaOh no...not another parody of WoO...T^T

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI hope you know the prequel to The Wizard of Oz, is Wicked... Right??
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitano... you did not.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaOH MY LORD!!! This looks epic!!! @_@
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitatop hat = badass
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitano that was james fransco. he looks a lot like him tho.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitacheck imdb
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco&lt;3333
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNo, no you most certainly did not. I don&#39;t even know who you could have possibly mistaken for Johnny Depp
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaAre you kidding? That piece of shit ruined Alice in wonderland and Willy fucking wonka!
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!!! This will be Epic!! Can&#39;t wait to see it

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaEvil Dead 4?

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie will have nothing to do with Wicked plot. First because on Wicked Elphaba and Glinda meet at school and the Wizard of Oz were already on Oz. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIf by &quot;better&quot;, you mean &quot;more rehashed and unoriginal&quot;.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaNo...
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitait is more based off the original books, not the film with Judy Garland. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitadid you read the novel? there was no such thing as the witch, it was a big fabricated lie made up by the wizard. the wizard came first, obvs.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitalol no, it has no relevance to wicked. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitawat
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIs there a reason we can&#39;t have Wicked yet? You know...An actual part of the movie...
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing, James Franco is too beautiful. 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai MUST see this!!! &lt;3
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitathis looks a lot like the alice in wonderland movie
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai think she&#39;s talking about the green hand at the end

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp isn&#39;t in this movie.... it&#39;s James Franco
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaLove the creepy witch hand
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaOMG Mila Kunis and James Franco...YESSS...
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this a Disney movie? They gettin grown on us... 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitai hope this is more like Tin Man than the Wizard of Oz, like still crazy wonderful, but a little more serious

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t know about this one
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaIf there is no Tim Burton there is no Johnny Depp lol.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaSooo....this is just the STory of the GREAT OZ from THE WIZARD OF OZ guy before Dorthy came into the picture, eeeehh....it looks okay. But can&#39;t anybody come up with something not involving other movies?
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaDID I SEE JOHNNY DEPP?!

_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!! :D Can&#39;t wait! 
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible- I only wish I could watch it with a clear mind after seeing Wicked, which was such a great story and visually and theatrically just as stunning! :) Can&#39;t wait to see where this takes off!
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaDisney shall pay for this.
_1NGnVLDPogdelimeterByIshitaFirst!

4CL4LNWHegkdelimeterByIshitaOne day I was flying a kite in the park. Around me, I could hear the laughter of children as they went down a slide, the barking of dogs as they played with their owner. I closed my eyes to take it all in and just enjoy life. But then I heard, &quot;Dave&quot;, whisper in my ear. My eyes shot open and I turned around, but no one was there. I figured I was just hearing things, so I closed my eyes again. &quot;Dave?&quot; I heard it again. I looked around again, but there was no one to see. I didn&#39;t imagine it that time. I know I heard it. The voice continued for days. &quot;Dave?&quot; &quot;Hello, Dave?&quot;. I couldn&#39;t figure it out. &quot;Dave, are you there?&quot;, the voice asked. I dropped on my knees and screamed &quot;WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!&quot; . I took out a gun and held it to my head. &quot;I want you to confirm your appointment, Dave.&quot; I burst into tears, with the gun still held at my head. But then I realized that I had y bluetooth in my ear the whole time. The End.
4CL4LNWHegkdelimeterByIshitaBieber dies. XD

4CL4LNWHegkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty funny. These actors are always pretty solid when it comes to comedies. So it should turn out okay, even if it has the super funny original to live up to.

4CL4LNWHegkdelimeterByIshitaYew
4CL4LNWHegkdelimeterByIshitayeeeeee
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitafucking goosebump .. man .. awesome 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI will cry.
I was Thai people.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this isn&#39;t Indonesia, it&#39;s Thailand. And it&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter these actor and actress are mostly western, I think they&#39;re the memorability of all victims. I don&#39;t care.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitayou see that person to the right at 2:05, 2:06 ish, thats me letting go of the lantern! fuck yeah!

Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaFunny how this movie supposed to take place in Thailand or Southeast Asia, but you barely see any Asians, if at all. Typical Hollywood.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like I just saw the movie by watching the trailer. It seems like they gave everything away. I mean it even showed the husband and wife reuniting at the end of the trailer.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitacheers to Damien!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitayou&#39;re right, you really don&#39;t understand.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen the actual footage.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaAnd you know this how? 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaU2 brought me here, then I stayed when I realized what the movie was about. Now I want to watch it.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThe soundtrack alone had made my eyes wet...brilliant!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaOne - U2 (Damien Rice covers) 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI feel like there&#39;s no reason to watch the movie after seeing that last scene
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song during the second half of the trailer?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaCaroline Johnson - couldn&#39;t have said it better myself! I think the whole discussion/argument is pointless. It&#39;s a film! That is all! It looks incredible and instead of people marvelling at how much effort and talent has been put into telling such a story, everyone&#39;s complaining about the fact the main actors are white! I hope to go into the film industry and if I had made this film, I would be so devastated that people are moaning about such a trivial fact and completely overlooking what an am
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaJvemPiRe14 - the film isn&#39;t even out yet, nobody fully knows what is included. We may see how other people are effected just not in the main story.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only white person who is exhausted with society&#39;s need to constantly make me feel guilty and ashamed of my race? I&#39;ve never claimed that my sufferings and struggles were worse than anyone else&#39;s, regardless of race. Without having seen this movie, I strongly doubt that was the message the people involved were trying to convey. It&#39;s Hollywood. Stop being so dramatic and try finding something more valid to complain about. 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be sad.  Petra Nemcova, her story of survival in this was heart wrenching.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitayou admit that the people who actually live there have more tragic stories, so why dont they do those? heck why cant the movie be from multiple angles, having the movie actually show how it effected so many different peoples lives! 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m crying watching the trailer! Imagine the actual film.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaSo much fail in your comment.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaOh, and also. The film consists of the main people who were involved in Spanish-language horror/drama film The Orphanage. This includes director, writer, production manager, cinematographer, composer and editor. So either they themselves decided to make this film English-speaking to appeal to a grander audience, or was forced upon by the studio.
And if any of you have heard or seen of the Orphanage and liked it, then as this has the same people involved, it could be very good.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWhat has Rita done to Betty/Diane?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThe waves never got that strong in the beginning. Give me a break.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaIs there really any point in watching this film since they basically gave away the whole story 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaAll the ridiculous comments on here about white people /Asian people and who it affected.The Ocean that day didn&#39;t look at race color the fact is it had no cares for who you were if you were in the way of it.This is a movie plain and simple enjoy it and remember everyone who died as a result of it on that fateful Boxing Day.We all bleed were all human.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaVery well said MelissaRose I don&#39;t understand why all the stupid arguing on here it&#39;s one story of the thousands to tell during Tsunami 04 and by the way it wasn&#39;t just Thailand that suffered but a whole continent.Enjoy the film and think...Jai yen yen 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe that people are managing to be racist pigs seeing as this film is about a real life family. How do you think they&#39;d feel if they saw the comments that you guys are leaving? 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the story director chose to make a movie. Everybody has a right to make one which convinces them
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaAs always on youtube about anything....rasisim has to poke its fuckin shitty face in everywhere......who fuckin cares....its a movie!!!!!!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaPowerful trailer!!!!!!
Looks very good.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThank you for posting this, MovieclipsCOMINGSOON.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaBefore you die, you see the ring.



Wait... wrong movie
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitait was made by and for western market?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaDid I say there were no white people in Asia? I&#39;m saying that there were thousands of people affected by this tragedy. And the one story that happens to be told and a movie made out of were white people on vacation? get the hell outta here with that BS....
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThank you for understanding.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaYeah exactly! I&#39;m not trying to be racist I&#39;m just saying wtf? I see shit like this often with white people.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaexactly. it&#39;s bullshiit.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaAnd its stupid and pedantic of you to not recognize the inherent problems with sifting through the no doubt equally tragic and inspiring stories of the majority of the population (non-white Thai people) in order to tell another story about white people (who are clearly tourists)
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThe problem people are having is that the majority of stories told in Western films are about white people, and even when the movie is about a tragedy that happened in a country where the majority are not white, their stories are still ignored in favor of the white narrative. This family suffered triumphed, AND THEN GOT TO GO HOME. Unlike the Thai people who had gone through just much as well as having their homes destroyed. And don&#39;t expect Hollywood to be telling that story anytime soon.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI mean if you look carefully it would appear no Asian person suffered at all - the only time you see a non-white face is during the typical &quot;ooo look at the weird foreign faces&quot; camera angle, as the kindly Thai women looking non the worse for wear help the poor beleaguered white lady. Really, not impressed.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThat was my first thought as well, among the no doubt thousands of stories of survival and loss - the one that gets told is of the white family on vacation- meaning once their tragedy was over they got to go home - unlike hundreds of thousands of Thai people who had gone through the same ordeal and had their whole world destroyed. 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI really don&#39;t understand why people have to complain about something all the time. Yes in THIS film the main characters are white, but there will be thousands of stories about Asian people which could have been more tragic. This event effected the whole world. But this particular story was chosen. Just take the film for what it is. It&#39;s in memory of the real tragedy, showing people that are unaware of the horror that really happened. Don&#39;t spoil the film and respect it will gain for the victim
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome!   great cover   Damien Rice!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s covering One by U2 in this trailer?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitagay
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m (WHITE) AND I TOTALLY GET THIS GUYS POINT, commercialism does not mean steriotyping ethnicity, even for a movie, people really need to look deeper than skin colour/class/ same old hollywoodesqe type, you took him litterally, the guy is correct , tragedy  no matter what, yet demeaned by @another white minded process...good on you rhymegarden....

Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThat kind of language is unnecessary, If the movie and the cast make u upset, dont watch it, its that simple. 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaJust found out, it&#39;s Damien Rice, One. Such an amazing cover!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshita0:21 in 2004 shooting Star Wars
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaIt sounds like its still Bono but accustic.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThere is nothing wrong with that. Something like the DBZ movie deserves the cold shoulder, not something like this.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaya know, I sometimes feel that films that aren&#39;t even meant to showcase Caucasians sometimes aren&#39;t worth seeing. Films like this show that a tragedy like this affected many people, not just natives.One family came out, spoke of their journey, and someone else decided they wanted the world to know about a deeply emotional time period through the eyes of the family that experienced it. 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI dont understand the &quot;controversy&quot; about this movie? Its a story about perseverance, strength and love. Why is this offensive to anyone?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWho sings this version... Its incredible!!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaSeems to be a good movie.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaA movie about a tragedy that happened in ASIA, and white people still manage to make it about them...wow. definitely not seeing this.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaLooks great! Really good casting (EWAN!) and all but it&#39;s a real shame they show all of it! They show they entire film even the ending! But it´s good that they make a film about the tsunami and it´s really a film about family survival. Just too bad that they show the whole film in just 2.32 mins. :// But i´m gonna see it anyway! ;)
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI thought the same thing at first but the ending is a foregone conclusion anyway. The family is alive but separated and it will be in their adventures as they search for each other that the story will happen. At least that&#39;s what I imagine will take place. And as jaostrich said, what&#39;s she doing in a hospital bed?  I will say it looks pretty sentimental, but being crazy for Naomi Watts I&#39;ll still check it out.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s a pity at they don&#39;t took the real One from U2. But I want to see it because it is the same at the true story at the people who felt a big earthquake!! 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshita@eduardovjk

Many films dont have a black person in their family, therefore, your racist for thinking its racist though it is not.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshita@imedi

No, I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s Cash covering One. Look it up.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaits not cash its damian rice singing u2 song called one
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshita3 people have no heart :( 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitai sure did lets wait a year and have directors cashing out on the theater tragedy 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitapretty white people that survived : the movie
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitabut what if she dies, she was in a medical bed

Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitatrue,but some movies make you wanna see what happened in the middle
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaoh my fucking god
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaFist 30 seconds is like the DEAD ISLAND trailer!!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWell they ruined the ending..2:22 shows them reunited... 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaA great cast and an amazing story of survival. I smell an Oscar nomination.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitathats because we dont like it when black ppl survive anything
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer just gave away the entire film WHOOPS!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaIf u watched this and didn&#39;t cry it&#39;s cause u left the computer to hug your family.

Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitashut up 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks sooooo good omg 
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitatell me that you&#39;re joking...
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitasong - Damien Rice - One (U2 Cover) ,u are welkom! with love from Russia
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI loved the trailer - it brought me to tears. But looks to much like Clint Eastwood&#39;s Hereafter - another beautiful movie. And the song is U2&#39;s One in Damien Rice&#39;s voice - the guy from &quot;The Blower&#39;s Daughter&quot; song!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaPussy ass people crying
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaNot a sigle black person in this family??? 

THAT&#39;S RACIST!!!!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaoh wow, i cried just watching the trailer, i saw a few family documental of this tragedy and makes me so sad and at the same time very proud of some human being, sometime we are good ppl! Must share this 4 sure!
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaLol, its not bob marley or bob dylan, its a cover of U2 - One
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaOMG...I cried just watching this film trailer.... isn&#39;t that crazy?  Must share....
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaOh my god I am so teary eyed right now... Wow.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaNo.  its a cover of a Bob Marley song
Forget the name
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaJohnny Cash not Dylan.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaWhen does this come out??
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitathis gave me the chills its heart touching.......:&#39;(
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitait does not matter who produces it ...sure there has been many movies of tragedy but those ovies had respect ...now in days people do movies of whatever ...that was my refference ..... 2 years from now some one is gong to do a theater massacre movie ...?
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaso they should&#39;ve never made any movies about the crusades? Or how about Saving Private Ryan? Titanic? Munich? 

These movies don&#39;t make fun of tragedies or take advantage of them, they showcase the human spirit. Yes the stories are sad and tragic, but they are also stories like this, stories of survival and love even in the worst of times.

Plus you guys need to get your facts straight, this isn&#39;t even a hollywood film. It&#39;s a Spanish produced film.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitahollywood slaps dead ppl in the face once again.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaSo does he find them? ... Oh wait there he is with her at the end of the trailer.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaI cried.
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie :)
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitahollywood really needs to stop making movies about tragedies...unless the proceeds go to the victims than its reasonable.....
Bgw394ZKsisdelimeterByIshitaBeautifully shot
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitawow brad pitt is getting better n better as a great actor :) 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaDamn This Movie I Wanna Watch

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaHELLO GLASGOW
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWOW!!!!!!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaso wrong , so damn wrong , hope they didn&#39;t fuck it up :( 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaeyegasm
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitawish they didn&#39;t name it world war z. looks like a good movie but nothing like the world war z book, which also could make a great movie
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWow! i was really suprised at how susepenful and intense the mayority of this trailer was!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaLooks a lot better than I thought it would but hell...it&#39;s a trailer and most trailer&#39;s look awesome. Still, how much longer is Hollywood going to use that goddamn &quot;BLLLAAAAAAAAAAARGH&quot; sound effect in their trailers? Whoever cut that inception trailer has a lot to answer for!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a good zombie movie (more like left for dead zombies since they run and all).
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell mountain of zombies
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaSeriously this could be any zombie movie. The story seems generic. The CGI is generic. The action looks generic. Overall, Generic.I will stick to the walking dead.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaJust no.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWar of the Worlds with zombies...
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitalol why does it matter?
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWorld War Zombies!... brad pitt is sick! gonna wait for this!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaive been waiting for this so long! YES!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitawhy does Brad Pitt have such long hair in this movie? 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaA cool take on zombies.
A zombie doesnt think so wouldnt patiently stand behind another - it would do what ever to get to its target, such as climbing over other zombies?!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshita2:03 WTF?
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitalooks like a prequel to i am legend
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaCall of duty world at war Z
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaHmm It&#39;s not easy to make turn any full-scale war into a movie.. i mean, look at war of the worlds, 28 days later etc... lot&#39;s of fighting etc.. but i&#39;m willing to give this movie a chance
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll probably see this, but they need to change the title.  This is not World War Z.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaDEMASIADO ARRECHOOO..
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaF U K I M R E A D Y. BRAD PITT IS A GOD.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks badass
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitawhat is their more of...all the bullets in the world or all the dead in the world?
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaZ stands for: The LAst War on earth..
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaZombie orgy
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitapinoy henyo??
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI love all these end of the world shit, gets my blood pumping
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re right, these zombies look way to fresh and having piles of zombies trying to climb over a gate just looks silly.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitazombies seem a bit... I am legend. but whatever
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaParkour zombies?? LOL epic fail, wtf is this shit
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the battle of Yonkers, or similar to it. 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaIn a world where one man...can save the world!...LMAO! I had too.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t read the book but I think this movie is gonna be great... come to think of it guys, if a zombie is slow and lumbering I wouldn&#39;t consider them a threat to humanity, people can outrun them and survive this kind of apocalypse. But with this movie version, they gonna scare the shit out of me.

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYeah and 28 days was a brilliantly made independent film about characters not all this CGI crap.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks insane. Can&#39;t wait!!!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis is the trailer for the Lemmings movie adaptation right?
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitazombies are back in the game!

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaDayZ, WarZ, World WarZ.........things are getting big with Z, next thing you know, God of WarZ

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis only a small part of the book that happen in US, i like the one in Japan were there&#39;s a blind modern day samurai fighting zombies
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWooooooooooooooooooow!!!!!!!!!!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYeah but those didn&#39;t look ridiculous. These zombie are in huge CG&#39;d piles it looks dumb. 28 Days Later had actors in make up not CG
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve read the book and the movie seems to be nothing like it but I still want to watch this. Like now.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks pretty original as zombie films go

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI need to trademark this Z suffix, so dayz, warz will pay me ha!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYeah fuck source material lets add in some stupid ass family as the main plot!
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYou mean WarZ.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got the book loaded on my kindle but I have not started reading it yet. I think I&#39;ll wait and watch the movie first so I&#39;m not disappointed.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitathey ruined the book!? this trailer doesn&#39;t show shit but that there making a movie about it
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThats because this is based on a book (or at least the name taken from) where the Zombie are NOT fast.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaare you freaking lol world war zombie that mean&#39;s you idiot 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like crap, but it was obvious it was going to be crap as soon as Brad Pitt was announced as tied to the project
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaat first i thought i was a movie about world war 3 ! LMAO fuckin zombies !Are u fuckin kiddin me? Again????
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI Am Handsom White Legend

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshita2:06 intelligent zombie lemmings detected
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThose are some crazy ass fucking zombies!

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaYou saw the movie?
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not anything like World War Z. It could still bengood but should be called Zombie War or some shit. Nothing like the book. Literally a zombie action movie with a little more politics. what a fucking joke
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME !!! 
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaI thought the zombies were supposed to be slow in the book
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaThey totally ruined the book, this looks HORRIBLE!!!

Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaWow, a wave of zombies.  I didn&#39;t know they could move like water.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitaSo the &quot;infected&quot; move together like crushing thunderous waves huh? Seems like a pretty interesting new take on zombies.
Md6Dvxdr0AQdelimeterByIshitathe CGI zombies are bumming me out

j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaah yeah…
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not my fault she has unplanned  pregnancies and doesn&#39;t want to work
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaDid Chris spit on Miss Collins&#39; Face? or She spit on Miss Collins?
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaThe look of the actress is so funny 😂😂😂
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaThe more decades pass, the more one realizes &quot;Carrie&quot; has to be in the top 10 best horror films ever made...DePalma at his best!
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI like how they misspelled the name of Steven King.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaRight the trailer showed the whole movie
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI am reading the book . Suddenly, I decided to find out if there is a film ...  Thanks for the wonderful video.  Peace and Love from Russia.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaOkay it&#39;s official Carrie white is secretly death from final destination
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching it. Masterpiece
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaA CLASSIC
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaAh yes, my favorite author, Steven King
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshita&quot;Trailers today are horrible. They spoil the movie before it even comes out&quot;
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaThey gave away the entire plot 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaShe looks like Elizabeth Olsen a bit
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaCarrie is supposed to be plump!
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaIf I was in this movie I would be friends with Carrie lowkey pretty
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaA movie masterpiece of psychological horror. Brilliantly paced and superbly acted. The 2013 dvd reissue of the film has a great interview (from 2001) with Brian De Palma and the cast and crew.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else notice that they botched the spelling of Stephen King&#39;s name in the trailer? They have it as &#39;Steven King&#39;.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaWhen I first seen this movie I thought Ms.Spacek was wonderful &amp; lord and behold, she is beautiful in the manners of her acting. Apparently, she is from Richmond VA-that&#39;s probably why, there more lady like. Lisa
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie ! That gym teacher was as tough as nails
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaTend on watching
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie❤ I watched The Original Don’t remember if is the original.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitathe actress playing Carrie is really too pretty for Carrie!
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI watched the film again yesterday. It&#39;s hard to bear. Carrie symbolises the born loser. Who just has bad luck and can&#39;t do anything right. She would have been my best friend. It&#39;s terrible how everyone treats her. I find this kind of violence hard to take. There are people who live a similar life. I hate bullies, they trigger me more than some other people. It&#39;s perfidious how people can take such pleasure in suffering. It&#39;s cruel how people deliberately isolate a person because that&#39;s the worst thing, to make a social being lonely.

j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaWow, John travolta’s debut movie
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaJeez the girl they got to play the lead is hideous.  Why pick her?
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaLike the trailer for the 1976 movie
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaCarrie is the Original Jason Voorhees
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaClassic, i cant wait for netflix to remake it with a black girl victim of rAcISm lol
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshita&quot;I didn&#39;t see the end of the film but I&#39;m sure she had a wonderful time...&quot;  -Linda Belcher
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaWatch this movie wen I didn&#39;t know any English word decided watch last night. what dang her BIBLE mothe r oh they kind kind of got it right but just a tiny exaggeratingtoo far crazy but got a few tiny right. Oh dang y they make her bible mom so dumb crazy her character seems not worth living. I think the real creator ( not talking about Christians god) creative humans to enjoy the earth and our purpose is to served others doing what our born nature have feels better emotionally n not feeling like her moms talks does she feel those cause she not her right self
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie horrible trailer
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshita2x speed 😂
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaHaha that’s what bullies deserve …  don’t mess with Carrie 💀
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaJust watched the movie again it’s a classic
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaSo ... if you go to prom, stay close to the fire exits.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaThey don’t make teen films like this anymore… And it makes sense not too
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaPoor carrie, I will be your friend!
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaJust saw a documentary about the Massacre in  Waco and for some reason I remembered this cult movie. m.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaCarrie
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaI’m not going to lie, when I saw this trailer I thought it was a joke about the repetition and structure of traditional horror stories.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaRip Alex Maskey 1939 2022
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaOh the original carrie movie.
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaLos que venimos de la nueva serie de Amazon
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshita1:47 Pm July 30th 2022

j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaTo think that Stephen King almost didn&#39;t complete the novel. All thanks to his wife for pushing him to finish it.

j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is the ultimate spoiler 😂😂😂
j9Mg-GRS46YdelimeterByIshitaOne of Brian De Palma’s best films since Scarface (1983). Carrie is indeed a horror classic. This one is way better than The Rage, the sequel that came out in 1999

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI Wish War Machine could get a stand alone Movie just 1.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s Here After Iron Man 2 Honest Trailer.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaIron Man 2 would have been better if they gave Whiplash more cool scenes like that race car scene. They should have kept him going for another film too. Better than Loki.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaThat moment when the third movie in a 22 movie superhero mega saga talks about how they&#39;ve successfully brought about world Peace.

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI think Iron man 2 is very underrated
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaPepper is so sooo hot!!!<br><br>Also, meanwhile Hydra is in Shield plotting world domination.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI loved everything in this movie, except the Scarlett Johansson&#39;s hair.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaHate when they put things in trailers and then take em out especially cool scenes
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWHO&#39;S WATCHING THIS 2017

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaomg watch this in slow motion they look drunk
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching this trailer before watching Civil War. <br>Damn... that big change of Tony&#39;s character
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaRIP Garry Shandling AKA Senator Stern
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoohRoVA9WQ&amp;t=2m14s">2:14</a> Boyz II Mens&#39; first film effort was a little startling to everyone.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitawho came back in 2016
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWow... this trailer is really weird looking back at it.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaLove the look on Downey&#39;s face when Paltrow kisses and throws the helmet out the plane.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaomg osm

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitahail Hydra
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshita Does the song that plays when whiplash starts talking have a name or is it just meant for this trailer?
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is awsome
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaIs Ivan Vanko a Lanister ? :D
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaIs this ivan vanko a lanister ? :D
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWhy do you miss the point of this channel
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitayes dear.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaFor people like me who are hesitant about buying the movie...
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI saw the movie
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshita(I&#39;m not serious about the Will Smith thing actually, just in case any one was wondering. I mean he&#39;s probably the worst guy for the job - short of getting a white guy and painting his skin dark!) 
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaI know. It&#39;s not that Don Cheadle&#39;s a bad actor or any thing, but Terrence Howard was so perfect for the character. It seems like they just thought, &quot;oh let&#39;s just get another black guy in to take up the role of James Rhodes: any old negro&#39;ll do! &quot; Which isn&#39;t to say that Don Cheadle or for that matter Terrence Howard can be called &quot;any old negro,&quot; but at least Howard looked the part. I mean why not get Will Smith to play hom in part 3; after all , he&#39;s black and has the tache gin on too! 
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaSomething happend about cost dispute&#39;s it&#39;s annoying as hell he would have been a better war machine 
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWhich not means the movie sucks.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see Iron 2 Man
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitairon man 2 is shit compared to 3
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshita/watch?v=0UBICQQao1I -_-
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitathis movie doesnt really age well. dialogue is crappy, justin hammer isnt a great baddie, black widow looks more like a kid playing dressup than a deadly spy. action is still great.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitawtf it was out like 3 years ago -__- Iron Man 3 is coming
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaNot yet
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitathis is not a bad trailer 
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWhat I can&#39;t figure out about this movie is why the Part of War Machine went to Don Cheadle. Didn&#39;t the previous guy want to reprise the role , or did he have other commitments that he couldn&#39;t get out of?? I mean it&#39;s frickin&#39; Iron Man!!! Why wouldn&#39;t you want to be part of that money spinner??? 
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitawoah! EPIC MOVIE! cant wait to watch it again 3 years ago
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaSo epic, I can&#39;t wait 3 years before! -_-
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaGoodmorning 

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitathe movie was awesome

BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaIm next to complain
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaHow is this fake?
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaThis, Is Going, To BEE, EPIC! May 3rd, huh? Totally worth it.
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitafake
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWow, I can&#39;t wait to watch this in the cinema -_-
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWell This certaintly isn&#39;t late at all....
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaA little late isn&#39;t it?
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaThis was not necessary -_-.!
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitalike si te gusto
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaWhy?
BoohRoVA9WQdelimeterByIshitaNice trailer
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI remember thinking this was gonna be a typical romantic drama with cliche scenarios....boi was i wrong
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaShe is so sweet.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know if I am the only one who got mad at Cindy. She is so selfish, she didn&#39;t even consider all Deans sacrifices before breaking up with him 🙁 if were Cindy, I&#39;ll be contented and happy with what I have even if my husband had nothing to offer but loves me unconditionally. That kind of love is very rare to fine now a days.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaLove is like a drug they both will kill you eventually
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie affected me somehow.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis is my 3rd favorite film &lt;3
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThe best performance of Ryan gosling’s and Michelle Williams career
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis is my point of view because this film really relate to me. Cindy having a complete family but didnt healthy it shows when her father yelling at her mom.thats why the reason cindy angry at her boyfriend when he is didnt use protection. Cindy want to have a family when she is ready and didnt do mistake like her family. Cindy meet dean who  really love her and take any risk with her.  after they married she is really try so hard for her family ,for her child, for her husband who is drunk ,have anger management issue,and dont have a decent job.<br>We saw Dean drop out of school ,dont have complete family,but a good man who want to give everything for his love. They married and he is really love his wife,child no doubt about that. But his life didnt really work. It isn&#39;t just about money. It is about self esteem,praise ,something to be proud of.what i saw in Dean is drunken ,have anger management issue,have low confidence even when Cindy try to comfort her .<br>And finally Cindy can&#39;t stand with Dean behaviour .she decide to devorce something that she think better than her parent that still together but hurt each other,On the other side Dean didn&#39;t want divorce cause he feel the divorce with his parent. And the maker decide to make it open ending.<br>My opinion is this movie thaugt us that love isn&#39;t enough to have a family and not just money,but healthy emotion ,thei goal in marriage is something should considere.<br>Nb: my mother language isn&#39;T english so iam sorry if it little confusing.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaAs the maker said this film come from his experience. I feel the same way not as a couple but asa child who must see both their parent hurt each other. My parents didnt divorce but they in pain and it effect me and mysister. I just realize love isn&#39;t enough in marriage you need something more.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWich it&#39;s the name of the song that it&#39;s singing Ryan?
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaFor me, this is on par with 500 Days of Summer and Closer. But this one, it made me really cried a lot because the movie was really close to home.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie ever especially for those who wants to get married HA! watch out guys open your eyes before you destroy your life Love is just a filling like now you cold  now is nice and worm!
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaA Very sad movie , as someone whose parents got seperated when i was a child , i believe that any couple when the decide to have children they should agree first that their critical decisions should be for the kid&#39;s best interest first of all, they should put their troubles a side and try truthfully to work their relationship and only when the can&#39;t and they agree both on that they should be parted and keep the respect between them , i know that sometimes it better that they get divorced and respecting each other than to be together in a sad and disrespectful relatioship but  .<br><br>We suffer from a selfish father or a stubborn mother , only kids pay the consequences and the scars stay forever carried .<br>Someone once said (an orphan is not the one who lost one of his parents to death , an orphan is someone who find a careless mother or a busy father )
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaIf you haven&#39;t seen the movie dont scroll down the comments until you see it....some spoilers ahead!!!
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t dare to watch this movie again coz i know i will cry so badly again😭😭😭😭😭
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaAn actual trailer...<br>Not the entire movie compact in a few minutes...
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaLucky producer!<br>1 million budget got him 16 million hahaha
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitashe met again the real father in the liquor store.. thats why she wants to break up with him.. oh well he should stop being a drunk to get his girl back again. 🙄🤔
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aILx69WrRhQ&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> why is the camera shaking?
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaRayn Gosling invited love and unhappy endings.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaVidmate
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaIt always been one sided love even in the beginning. Cindy only wants to marry because she was pregnant. She does not love the guy from my point of view.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaAs in real life most people are never satisfied. Bummer.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie an hour ago and I am simply in some other dynamic. Sadly, now I am gonna question and doubt the possibility of every happiness or a fresh relationship. But this is reality!!! This breaks my heart!<br>If you are reading this comment I would recommend you to watch this movie! You will question alot! You&#39;ll learn alot. <br>Best movie ever!
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitawhat song is he singing
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI watched this after a breakup lol bad idea
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWhat Requiem For A Dream did for drugs this does for marriage
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI hated Cindy I mean dean never did anything to her she started all the bullshit ,he deserved better tbh .
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaRyan got paid too much for this movie, but as Michelke says, Hollywood is run by a bunch of misogynist reprobates. Oh well . . .
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitathe trailer is everything 😢
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaDo not watch this after a breakup.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI hated the woman during this whole movie. Felt so sorry for the guy.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaSad movie.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaAbout to watch this for the first time
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was eh..,
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t crying along the movie until i watch the ending. But I&#39;m wondering why Cindy just cut it off like that? I&#39;m a realistic person but they vowed each other,  in a better or worst and I see no big mistakes from his husband.  Why can they fix it together? But i bet if they were not divorce, cindy would play with another man. Really. So frustassing .
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis is his best movie after The Notebook
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaGeez, thank god I never married young
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI like this movie.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitathis movie broke me
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWonder if she will still let him see the kid even though im assuming the will get a divorce
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI have not watched this film yet, since every time I watch the trailer I end up crying.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaHe deserve a better woman.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaShe thinks having a good job and bringing in the bucks and achieving status is what matters from a husband - but i promise you, people would die for the love he gave her.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaGosling was great In The Note Book.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaFeel amazed of how great the movie was and i&#39;ll keep the great pain in silence, won&#39;t tell anybody because it is so damn hurts
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best films I&#39;ve watched. I haven&#39;t bawled since Titanic.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaSuch a sad movie man
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThe end scene is almost hauntingly beautiful
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaOmg that tap dancing though
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was supposed to be an erotic movie but I rather ended up being depressed than masturbating!
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will always have a special place in my heart ❤
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not watching this again, so F depressing.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant film.  Amazed at Gosling&#39;s talent, despite the heartbreaking story you feel uplifted to have witnessed a master at work.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so sad how this movie is closer to reality than all the other happy ones
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best sad movies..It shows what happens to a nice guy
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWhat a whirlwind of a movie. A powerful film. Probably one of my top 5
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so sad that it&#39;s hard to watch at times.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWondrous movie. Uplifting and heartbreaking.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThe last scene with the daughter crying after her father is the epitome of sadness
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI can already tell I’m going to cry 😅
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaMost boring movie ever!!!
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaSuch a beautiful movie
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitadean tried hard to save their marriage but cindy didn&#39;t tried ...dean accepted her pregnancy, got beaten by her ex bf, loved her daughter alot, married her, loved her ... in one scene he was sleeping on floor.. thats how much he sacrificed .. she choosed to marry a guy who was not rich.. was not good enough for her..it was her mistake not dean&#39;s.. dean wanted to talk to her .. wanted to make things right but cindy was not ready.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis is probably one of the best films about a love story that doesn&#39;t work out. When two people divorce, others like to believe or assume that the two never truly loved one another. It&#39;s definitely hard to fathom that two people can start their relationship as beautifully as every other Hollywood romcom leads us to believe, and then take that relationship, that connection, that bond to a very dark place. But unfortunately, it happens all the time, and it usually happens to couples who got together before they fully grew into themselves.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaNever watch this with ur partner or the idea might grow on you.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWhy, at 43 years old, I simply can&#39;t be bothered with this kind of thing anymore...and I quote...&quot;I hate to break it to you, but what people calls &quot;love&quot; is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. &quot; R.S.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t stop watching this piece of art .
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitais there nothing like Keith film vibe anymore.. i cant watch this for twice coz it depressing. like a la la land kind of story.

aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaMichelle Williams 😍😍😍
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitawheres their oscars
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was very realistic in its plot, showing the insane challenges modern relationships experience go thru today. By the time the beginning of the movie starts, the wife is feeling quite numb and discontent. This is picked up by the husband who goes about the wrong way of trying to save the marrage. In the end, the one who gets hurt the most was the adorable little girl who did nothing wrong.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaOne of the bests movies i ever watched
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaum nope . This is going to be super sad.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitareally good movie. ryan is such an amazing actor. <br>*spoiler question*: anybody understood why cindy broke up with her first boyfriend?

aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitathis trailer is a piece of art.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaThis is a very good movie ! Got me into it ! I think the actress could have been a little more supportive for her husband, it kinda pissed me off when he’s the one doing everything and she doesn’t takes part in any of the activities . Trust me I loved deans acting it was very realistic it wasn’t like acting it was real so it was good for the movie .
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaSuch a spectacular movie.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a sad movie but it shows how real relationships are not the typical happy ending ones
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaWatched this on valentines day and I cried up a storm
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaHad too be a little hard doing this after losing her husband I never seen it heard it was a sad movie.
aILx69WrRhQdelimeterByIshitaI felt extremely depressed after watching this movie.

3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitastraight to video
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitadon&#39;t fucking care if they put the whole movie in the trailer, it looks so good and Jake G is my fave. plus, just because it seems like they put the whole movie in a trailer, doesn&#39;t mean it will suck or have some plot twists.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaseems like a great movie,can&#39;t wait
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaOf course the customer service lady had to be pretty
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI must say...i look forward to seeing it...
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitataking something apart is childs play, put it back together perfectly and youre a genius. unless its ikea. then youre stupid for getting ikea.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitathis looks depressing AF
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMy favorite Jake Gyllenhaal movie is the one where he plays that guy who goes crazy.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI swear if he doesn&#39;t get nominated for an Oscar again, it was a huge mistake when he wasn&#39;t nominated for Nightcrawler
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaFantastic!! Another movie I don&#39;t need to pay for because they told me the whole damn story and showed me key scenes with a 3 minute summery. <br>Keep it up hollywood!!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitathis looks soo good
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitadid i just saw the whole movie? whats with the stupid trailers these days
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaIn the next movie his wife gets a FUCKING PAPERCUT and he starts EXAMINING HIS BALLS. How&#39;s that Fox? Just give me money already.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is sexy~
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWat.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMy friends cousin is in this movie just barely tho ;(
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI need a redband for those intimate deconstructing scenes. Suspenders/10
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaIn this film Jake Gyllenhaal is the most well groomed/clean cut guy having a mental breakdown I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s like, not matter what Jake has to look pretty to put asses in seats.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI feel like jake is so underrated. He always kills every role he does
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitabest actor in Hollywood right now
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitathat kid is a reincarnated river phoenix
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWHy do I get this feeling that the movie isn&#39;t going to be as good as the preview.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;d watch this movie simply because Jake Gyllenhaal is in it. also I like the theme of self destruction and renewal.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWhat makes me a good demoman
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitalooks like a good movie<br>everything this guy touches is good
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaYeah cause when my car starts hesitating on the highway, I think, time to tear the whole thing down and figure out whats wrong.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaStupid f in movie
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail made me think of &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#39;s&quot;
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t be as bad as Enemy (it wasn&#39;t terrible, I just don&#39;t like spiders).
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitahe died in the accident too and hes really a gohst - m night shamyiland
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaSnore... next!<br>😴😴😴😴😴😴
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMy girlfriend likes to cheats so since she a hoe text dick pics to (424) 241-7286  to teach her a lesson
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaIs this supposed to be a chick flick? I would never watch that movie in a million years.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitahe could have just...oh idk...SOLD THE HOUSE!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaGyllenhaal stay working
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaBy the way the kid is really cute wtf
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaJake one of the best actors right now, fav.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaLooks intriguing
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks random af
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaplz ....subscribe my channel plz
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaLooks like another good one.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got 2 tickets to the gun show and I&#39;m not giving it to you... I&#39;m taking your tickets heh heh... <b>burp</b>
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaJake is kind of a guy who just wanna make good films. Like Leo. I love both actors. And their utmost commitment. And fuck all the awards.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaAll I see are white people problems. . . Pass
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaAxe and Smash but nobody knows who they are
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThe beginning of the trailer looks good then by the end it just seems to cheesy for me atleast from the trailer
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI hope I get to watch this.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitagive this guy an oscar
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaAlright I&#39;m interested
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWow, another pointless movie.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t see what&#39;s special about this movie at all, the music at the beginning was amazing ( reminded me of my guitar hero days) Just don&#39;t see the appeal at all <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23donniedarko">#donniedarko</a>
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaAh, I was hoping he would be a nighcrawler psycho again.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaim a simple man.I see Jake Gyllenhaal, I like the video.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaTHIS IS WHAT I CALL A GODDAMN TRAILER &lt;3
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThanks for showing me the whole movie Fox Searchlight!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaDemolition? Man, I can&#39;t believe they remade this and didn&#39;t bring back Stallone and Snipes.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWhat is with Jake getting his wife killed recently?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitakind of hoping for another thriller like nightcrawler, eh looks pretty good tho
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaGreat concept! Relatable and powerful! I will watch this!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaIt looks like we have seen the whole movie in the trailer but I get a felling that there is much more to it. <br>I am Excited.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;d say this looks like Oscar bait because of who is behind this film on the producer end..but this really doesn&#39;&#39;t look deep enough.  Even the movie itself only looks ok but the subject and direction don&#39;t look all that deep.  Everything in Hollywood has pretty much been done before, but this particularly looks right out of a mold of many predecessors.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitait&#39;s nice to see demolition d+ getting his own movie
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaooooook?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI thought this released already...
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaHow is this r rated
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitahe&#39;s probably gonna get the kid killed in the movie<br><br>or seriously injured, something like that
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThis guy loves to lose someone
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitameh..
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMan he is a great actor. You know this is going to be good
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMusic is great. Story looks dumb ass hell
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitahonestly thought this was going to a trailer for a new demolition man movie.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaSong at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UnSXelOJo0&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a>??
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaKids don&#39;t bae and drive!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMan this movie looks super exci... ResidentSleeper
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaBut night crawler tho ! Can&#39;t wait to see this also
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThis looks promising.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitais the little boy on Nickelodeon?  I swear I&#39;ve seen him before.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaSo is no one going to thank me for making Jake Gyllenhaal?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWhat the FUK is this a comedy a drama some gibbby stuff <br>.<br>I don&#39;t know how to ................
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaFor some reason i feel like the message of this movie is taking things apart and putting them back together..
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaSolid.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaHeart-Crazy on you. Love this song.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaMight be good if it doesn&#39;t get too corny.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI love Jake but what is it with Jake&#39;s wife dying in his past two movies?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitafirst i feel boring stupid then the last 5 seconds i wanna watch this movie
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaThis guys deserve a Oscar before Leonardo.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaLooks fucking gay.<br><br>I love it.<br><br>- Best Executive 3026
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaI love short movie like this!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaHey it&#39;s his October Sky father.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaFUCKING JAKE KILLING IT AGAIN!
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaWhat is the song that plays at the beginning of this trailer?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitathanks for showing the whole movie in the dam trailer fox.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitais he gay?
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaJake is my favourite actor I SO CAN&#39;T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN THIS MOVIE
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaHm I liked this better than the first trailer.
3UnSXelOJo0delimeterByIshitaJAKE AND JEAN-MARC  !

CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathere always a girlll!!!... 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitai think the book is good, and i like number six... and bernie kosar. :)
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitawell this looks....yeah how are you?
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Bernie Kosar? that dog is my favorite character from the book!!!!   
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Mcpanicfanic yeah these good looking guyes always getting the amazing women =( I love Dianna Agron in Glee, so I&#39;m really look forward to see this movie^^
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap! This dude has a FLASHLIGHT POWER in his hands!!!

Means there will be no electric energy problems in the world from now on? :D So we dont have to burn fossil fuel any longer? This movie has multiple statements. Besides &quot;Love conquers all&quot;, there is one that concerns the environmental pollution and its reduction. Awesomeness PURE!

*Sarcasm off*

I think this film is an average bullcrap that is. The only ones, who can save this junk from a total disaster, are screeching teenies. IMHO.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@PreDeadCinema dont forget coveneant

CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitatoday i did number 2! lol
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitawhat happened to the others??...i mean number 5,7,8,9?...i don&#39;t get it
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathis looks lame
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitanumber 6 looks awesome!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Glaborifec nope they just filmed whats in the book.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@lon3somechicaNAca well they can&#39;t pack a 360 pages book into a 90 to 120minutes movie and lots of things from the book might slow the pace of the movie too much for the audience to enjoy it. So I guess they will put in the movie only the most important stuff and seal the deal with lots of action &amp; a bit of the love story. I&#39;m only wondering if they will show us the beasts in the battle outside the school or not. ^_^ I just hope that if they do they beasts will look cool though.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 What would you suggest?
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE FUCK
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaITS QUINN FABRAY! XD 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitahas anybody else heard of john smith from anything sci-fi?
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Mcpanicfanic yay for infonugget :D
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like these douche-bags just mixed Push, The covenant and Jumper and this came out.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaseems cool. also seems like they couldve chosen a better title
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 LOL &quot;Jumper&quot; in a nutshell
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992  Gonna watch it anyway
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 

no, no, no, it&#39;s totally different, there&#39;s nine of them. See
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaand once again im pretty sure the movie won&#39;t beat the book. i mean not trying to hate it does look alright but trust me read the book and you&#39;ll see what i mean
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 

Well lets be honest here....this movie is obviously relying on the main actors&#39; looks to attract viewers. 
(having a crush on BOTH Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron, I know what I&#39;m talking about.)
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita2:05 Once again over zealous trailers have fucked up what was probably going to be a cool reveal in the movie.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitanumber 4 has glowing hands so he can jerk off at night
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@ashselena33 Who?

Gay, is one idea that comes up in my head :P
but let&#39;s be fair, i mean it does remind some of you.. of The Fallen movies right? that combined with.. the covenant i assume. i still would like to see this movie though.. just into watching movies.. :D
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 Who cares? It looks awesome.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathey aren&#39;t together anymore. xp read it on his facebook ;)
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@riprob16 Get Micheal Bay to make it and it will be.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaMichael Bay sucks
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 LOL AHAHA &lt;3
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaD_U_H
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitai wish dragon ball z was like this
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaTwilight + Jumper = This shit
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Mcpanicfanic shes really lucky :)
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@seksyen4babyface michael bay is the producer.He is betting his money on this junk.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@MichaelBarry1992 boring
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@PLASMAVITY lol this isnt by micheal bay 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitakill michael bay ! kill michael bay.Just, joking.Don&#39;t kill him,just enroll him in a kindergarten where he can just live his childhood once again instead of making crap movies over and over again.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathe book was good, and NOT like twilight. its not a crappy love story, there is way more action and suspense. I reccomend it
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@departedpro or magnaman....
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaSo that&#39;s how they got together. He has a good American accent.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaDianna Agron. WOW is she beautiful!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Haloid98867 how are you supposed to know he is number four if he doesn&#39;t say it. what if he said &quot;i am number 9&quot;
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaGave me chillllllssssss. ! &lt;3
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathe words in the beggining are sooo overly dramatic!! &quot;he looks like one of us..........BUT HES NOT ONE OF US!&quot; duh duh dum!!!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaDianna Agron and Alex Pettyfer are dating in real life! :)
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m so excited! i just finished reading the book, if the book is at all like the movie, then the movie is going to be amazing. 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitawhat a ripoff version of 2 marvel characters, but who notices anyways? oh yah, this is going to be great...
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this is going to be really different! 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitafunny that i smelled michael bay even before i saw his name in this trailer
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@departedpro 

or iMag.

I don&#39;t like to say things remind me of other things because well, that would leave me with out an imagination and judging from the book cover, however! this did kinda remind me of dark angel. and olyphant rocks
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@killerjoker23 
:|
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@Comedy4RS I Am Legend sucked balls so I don&#39;t think anyone cares.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaIt’s like iron man without the iron part. 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita2:16 Im still Tryina Fiqure Out Witch Sex Position That Is !
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitawow. I already knew this was gonna be a shitty movie the moment i saw that Micheal bay was directing it but the cherry on top of this shit-tastic movie happened at 2:04. IF, in ANY FUCKING MOVIE MADE AFTER 1995, showed a person walking away all &quot;cool and calm&quot; while something exploded behind them, you know this movie sucks. Freakin idiots.
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@lareinelaluna Sorry for correcting you but please, dont make any more miss-spells, its Goku :P
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaHUMAN FLASH LIGHT!!!!!!!!!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaive seen dumb movie..i think this will take the cake...chick is hot though

CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita@greatworld1979 10!
(:
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshita&quot;that, is, kinda private, actshalee...&quot; what language is that? Sounds like 
generic dumb girl that thinks she&#39;s something special cuz she likes photography but she&#39;s just another girl that looks like all the other cookie cutter girls dialect.
This will be her last film and she will be another forgotten piece of eye candy in another generic forgettable film with conflict and resolution and a token hot girl.
 
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitathe man is hot ! i love this film..fantacy ...i love it..i find the girl number six is hot..they should be together...number 4+6
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitawell i guess that&#39;s the whole film then :p man i hate trailers like this!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitafrom what i saw he shoots light from his hands like iron man and move cars like magnito did so he should be called irongnito xD
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaOMgosh....!! Deborah is that her name?.... is really pretty!
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaLolz .. hes the &#39;Non-Iron - Man&#39; :)))
CfMMosvPHfQdelimeterByIshitaalex pettyfer! hell yes, was that natalie portman?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitawhen i saw this trailer the only thing that came to my mind was DEAD SPACE that was such an awesome game imagine it being made into a movie im definately watching this
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaish :(
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalooks nice
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDifferent but not to the greatest degree. And I wasn&#39;t criticizing it for being like that.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaAnother Resident Evil... what are you talking about?... Alien 5?.... what´s the difference with other movies... thanks to all the people that view this now we haven´t real good movies... when will you be tired of E.T.?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaReminds me of...guess what?...

 DEAD SPACE!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaooooo
the dude from twilight &lt;3
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDAMN ! this trailer looks awesome in HD Full Screen.
Perfect
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitafirst movie i&#39;ve seen in a while that i wanna see
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDamn Skippy!!!

They should have just named it that!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis is basically The Descent in space.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalol everyones saying dead space
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDEAD SPACE!!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathis is almost like a movie made from the game dead space.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThe first time i saw this i thought it was the new aliens movie.unfortunatly not.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitano...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitadead space borrowed most of their ideas from doom anyway
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathe resident evil movies coulda had a little better script but were done pretty well. this looks original and awesome.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a toned down version of Dead Space, still spook and good though
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitavery Alien-ish
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re a little Dense sir. Necromorphs from Dead Space are nearly the same exact alien creature as &quot;The Thing&quot;. The developers of Dead Space even stated this. Get a clue.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t they make it Dead Space? Because it&#39;s pretty much a ripoff of The Thing, although a good rip off.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathat would be sick, but they would fuck it up like doom
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshita~Lights...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathey are making one
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathey should have made a live action dead space movie. that would be kick ass
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaStill, Dead Space&#39;s necromorphs look much much scarier
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalol WTF they stole from dead space lol
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitai&#39;m going to see this one!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis looks good.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshita$50 that the passengers woke up before the crew ate each other and turned into morlocks and its been hundreds of years since they departed or some crazy shit like that...lol
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis looks like fearish, resident evil, with a cross of alien.......weird, but it still looks goodXD
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathere is one, its a prequel to the game
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaOh, great idea... Rip-off of &quot;The Cave&quot;... but in space. &quot;...Cave&quot; was alright; this one may be as good.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaSweet! looking froward to a good space thriller!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaSo basically Resident Evil in space.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitanice..looks cool
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDead space continuation into a movie or something! like Isaac still looking for nichole and finds people alive in ishimura but even more enemies! crap, number one in  list of movies to see!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaTHIS is Dead Space.... o-o
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaMight as well call it dead space lol
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaGod damit I hate zombie babies so much.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDead Space anyone?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaResident evil meets ALIEN !

KEEP UR MOVIES OUT OF THE RECYCLE BIN !
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitayah totally looks like dead space but it looks kinda good
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitacan some1 say &quot;dead space&quot; movie?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaBy the way - why does Hollywood still think the aliens are about our size and have a humanoid shape? It&#39;s time to innovate the genre.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s so lame about it? If you don&#39;t like sci-fi look elsewhere. It SEEMS good though. Looks like they&#39;ve put the crew back into Nostromo, the whole crew in focus instead of one woman (Ripley). And a lot of aliens.
I just hope the movie don&#39;t end just like Event horizon...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitado you know how ridiculous you just made yourself out to be? Have you ever seen an episode of Family guy? you say it &quot;Rockz&quot;, yet the show is always poking fun at blacks. anywhozles, just though i&#39;d point that out
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitait look&#39;s like a cross between resident evil and alien. Also there all like &quot;what happend to the crew&quot; well i think the zombie&#39;s are the crew. Creepy stuff. Look&#39;s good.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaokay i am not racist...but....every movie has to have a white girl or white guy.  most of the girls have the following: blonde or brown hair....and a nose job.. wtf i mean this world has more than white people in it....
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of the game Dead Space.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshita*drool*
Sci-fi zombies, hope this is an 18 and gruesome as hell
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaI hear ya we will certainly see.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaOh my god...This DOES remind me of Dead Space! But only in certain parts....
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitakinda reminds me of the decent and alien. but only a little bit.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaBen Foster is great, loved him on &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; and &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;. As for this, let&#39;s see...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThis would make a good videogame!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaWell they did a Great job of screwing up Resident Evil so lets see if they fuck this up too
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathe truth: Zerg...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThe monster thing at the end looks like the monster babies from dead space. It&#39;s just missing these claws coming out of the bag.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitahow do you know???  unless you have seen it but otherwise i wouldnt have thought anyone has seen this movie yet, please, explain how this movie is &quot;so dumb&quot;.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t they already make a movie like this....?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalol all the references to Dead Space. Dead Space is/was about aliens, DNA, and zombies, as a game it was cheesy and mildly entertaining. And as a stand alone cartoon movie it was still cheesy. Cheap ripoff or not at least you get to see real emotion from real actors.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m slightly confused.  The synopsis on the right states these 2 crew members don&#39;t know who they are yet they are clearly seen using their own names and the one guy even calls Dennis Quaid &quot;sir&quot; when he wakes up.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitai hate these movies...in the beggining its all: oh where is everybody? we are all alone... and then everybody shows up..
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitareminds me of deadspace
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitai could of swore i was watching a dead space movie...
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaYESSS!!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaNot Exactly.  I wouldn&#39;t say ANYONE was a zombie in Event Horizon
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitai think the people who put them on the ship did that to them so they will be more adapted to their new home.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitayeah! lol i was thinking the same.....
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaFUCK wen does it come out lol
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaKick-Ass ! More SciFi Please !!!! Bring it !
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDEAD SPACE
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitacraponusa?? wtf dude!! fuck you not for ur comment bu for ur name u suck
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitai want to see this! =)
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaehh ok i gues
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaWoah. That kid thing looks fucking weird.... I can&#39;t wait to see it. :D
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaThe environment reminds me of Dead Space and the thing on the guys wrist at 1:42 - 1:43 looks like a pipboy
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathe zombies or whatever they are look pretty gay, besides that this movie looks decent
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty intense, but I don&#39;t know if I want to see it. It seems kind of like a space-y Resident Evil, you know?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDead Space....The movie
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaits like a good film...i will see
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaDead Space influence?
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathis kinda looks like Alien and Predator mixed into one kick ass mother fucking movie!!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaIf you think he&#39;s telling you what he&#39;s actually seen then you need to think again.  Every horror movie in this day and age ends that way.  He&#39;s telling you what he knows will probably happen because there is no creativity left in the movie buisness when it comes to scary movies.  But at least the monsters are fun to look at.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalol, I can&#39;t believe people gave you negative votes for that.  Its so true!  I would bet money that it happens that way.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaWow!....Cung Le is in this movie!!!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitait looks like doom in a way and dead space
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitasweet! I&#39;m totally gonna see this!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitasorry im not really that scared
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalol the ship looks lie the USG Ishimura, the screaming of the aliens is the same..they might as well cal it Dead Space...but i agree with the other people, a dif version of dead space!!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitathere ain&#39;t a parasite or alien involved is there, so how is it similar to dead space?

i&#39;m a bit doozy so i didn&#39;t pick out the dialogue heh.
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitacoolness!!!
it looks awsome!!!
and the guy from twilight is there
so im soo seeing itt!
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaLook&#39;s good
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaMight as well call this movie dead space
it is sooooooo similar :S
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitalooks pretty good
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitaIts like stealing the story of dead space..
PItZ-qr9jG8delimeterByIshitamight be good.

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaI hope they do this like the incredible hulk where if you like the first one then this can seem like a sequel instead of a reboot.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaCERSEI Xd... Nice.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitajudge dredd has always had a deep voice....
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaJudge Dredd: The dark night?

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaYeah, Chuck Norris is back!! With Mask, without beard

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaJudge Dredd is a comic line jackass, where judges are like police officers that make the decision to kill or arrest on the spot. Basically, a judge &quot;judges&quot; who will live for their crimes
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaShame, I would have liked to see Stallone reprise his role...
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaGreat now we know that sersie survives into the future
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThey took every line that was from the last movie and put it into their trailer
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitadreDD.. 2D
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaIf they can&#39;t even spell judgement right, I don&#39;t think I can see a movie about a Judge who is going to deliver &quot;Judgment&quot; on the other hand Lena Headey is in this movie and shes sexy as all hell in Game of Thrones!

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshita:/
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThe guy reminds me of Captain Falcon LOL
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaNo Stallone? WTF!!!! Booooooooooooo
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shiiiiiiiiiiiit.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaYOU&#39;VE BETRAYED THE LAW!!!!       LLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHWWWWWW!!!!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaSo the drug&#39;s kinda like weed?

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaLonnnng and lotsa talking....BOREing...

G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitayay Cersei!!!!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitanice... magneto?
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitathe crappy old judge dredd was better than this
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaWhere the FUCK is Rob Schnieder?!?!?
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaIt be cool as shot if stallone makes a cameo and shows this d-bag up !!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaQueen Cersi ftw
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaanother shit movie...............
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaO HEKKS YEA I WANNA WATCH THIS!!!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitathis is an older concept tbh, most likely the raid ripped of this concept
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaRight on brother!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitadamm i could see this becoming really popular just like the batman begins triology, if this makes enough money then i bet they can make a pretty kick ass sequel 
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t even a kid. I&#39;m starting to get worried!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaCersie?!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThe only Judge, Jury and Executioner I know is Two Face...
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like they just ripped the story from &quot;The Raid: Redepmtion&quot;
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaMeh the original was the shit back then. This looks like another generic 3D B movie.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThey miss pelt &quot;judgement&quot; @ 0:47 
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaNeeds more Stallone. Just not the same. I AM THE LAW!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshita@skillsthatkills4832 you remember wrongly Dredd has been around since 1977
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaI AM... THE LAW!!!!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitathe story seems same with &quot;The Raid Redemption&quot;, isn&#39;t ?
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S AGAINST THE LAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaBOOOOOOOORING
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThat is Cercei Lannister.... I hate her already.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaseems boring
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaRobocop was early 80&#39;s I believe. Dredd was early 90&#39;s?
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaRobocop looks like Dredd. Not only has Dredd been around for longer but Robocop was based on the  character
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t hold me to this but im pretty sure Judge Dredd has been around longer (again I&#39;m not sure)
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a judge now home slice.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaAcaso dijo &quot;Yos oy la ley&quot; :(
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaterrible costume, he look like robocop
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaAre you talking about the comic or the really shitty Stallone adaption cause as a fan of the strip the original movie murdered judge dredd. it was like watching a good friend die. Honestly this looks more in the original style of the comic by not revealing his face. Also the lawgiver in this film looks better.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s stalone when u wanna Fuck up a movie
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaDamn I hope that last part wasn&#39;t the ending .
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaSTALLONE FOREVER!!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaSabia que dirias eso.....
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaRIP Judge Dredd, We will miss you.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaJUDGEMENT TIME!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaDeath of a Classic from my Childhood!!
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaI Am The Law !!!!! 
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaDude I am in
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitathird 
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks pretty cool.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitasecond.
G-eI5oLlIeYdelimeterByIshitafirst.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHmm, this is looks somewhat like Die Hard in ways. I&#39;m excited
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaKILL TWO-FACE! Morgan Freeman would make a much better president
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaYou fuck with the God, you get Leonidas right in the kisser
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDamn this movie is gonna look good!!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitathe only thing missing was a good &quot;Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!&quot;

ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaNo it needs to have no cgi like all the best movies ever(80&#39;s)
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDirector of Training day = AWESOME

gerald butler = OK

now is it pg13 trash or R rated?

The director makes R rated flicks so i guess it will be R, looks like a cool wannade die hard movie
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitalol things escalated quick...f&#39;kin hell.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaI guess not every movie can be Skyfall or the Dark Knight.  just shaking my head at this trailer...
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaI was waiting for bruce willis to show up. Looked like a die hard movie to me.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaGood, Harvey you&#39;re here. careful the two-face has a gun and he looks super pissed
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitafinally a movie worth the great Leonidas...this iS SPARTAAAAAAAAA xD
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaNeeds better CGI. 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitathe CG sucks
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitasame exact thing I was thinking
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHow the new Red Dawn should&#39;ve been
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard :P :P
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitajack baur did these all things....just saying :P
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshita&quot;Kill one save a thousand&quot; u can always reelect
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitasooo who else saw and thought this would have made a great die hard movie
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitarubbish
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re talking about bad CGI sir!

ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaa mashup between batman and red dawn .... with gerard butler ... 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaEnemy AC-130 above!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHmm sounds similar to White House Down and the CGI needs some serious improvement.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s Bill Russell
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitatypical steven seagal or harrison ford/die hard action movie? i tought this was 2013 already
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaBecause the cast is stellar, I&#39;ll overlook the crappy CGI and the Die Hardesque plot. Bring it on!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaLMAO
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard with A White House... some one can think of something more clever I&#39;m sure.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWho remembered Splinter Cell Conviction?
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a wack version of Air Force One...
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaVery excited to see this! Was filmed 1/4 mile from my house! Watched them film parts of it. It was cool watching a replica of the White House be built in our town :)
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHow about taking down another country for once!!! China would be a nice start!!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitajust another die hard
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHmmm a White House action movie with Harvey Dent as President, Lucius Fox as the Speaker Of The House, and Leonidas as top military special operative taking on North Koreans? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaLOOOOOOOOOOOOL
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaGreat more american propaganda shit.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaActors are great, the plot is intriguing, but WTF is up with the special effects? My 12 year old nephew can simulate better explosions on his smartphone than these big Hollywood names - Film District and Millennium.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaobviusly morgan freman is the speaker of the house
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWhatever potential this movie had is ruined with that overuse of CGI
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaNeat.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard in Washington?
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaAnything with Gerard Butler is pretty much guaranteed to be shite. 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaGreat. Harvey Dent becomes president and we get invaded by the North Koreans!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDERP
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard 2013 STYLE =)
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaNice trailer....the only thing missing was Kiefer Sutherland and the digital clock......
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaOh god, the CGI
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaAnother trailer that gives away too much.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it that Hollywood insist in giving Ideas to terrorist  on how to blow the white house????...... 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks awesome CG looks like its gonna suck
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaOH look... Another bullshit movie about someone trying to destroy America... The only one who is capable of collapsing another nation, are either USA, or ALIEN INVASION!

...
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThe graphics look crap!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap! Looks absolutely ridiculous but still insanely awesome!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitawhere is batman when we need him most. harvey dent is now the presedent of united states?
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDamn. This looks frigging awesome. 2013, the year action makes a comeback!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitansa is going to track you in 3...2..1 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaGod,this movie is gonna be good
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaAmerican &quot;President&quot; is a main terrorist.

USA = TERRORIST HOMELAND
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitayet another script assembled from templates by robots
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThis film will kill Antoine Fuqua&#39;s career, ＄80Million for this?!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaAnother action hollywood shit.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaUnder siege Washington D C...
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaits like die hard meets the west wing
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitagamer v2.0 ft cod MW3 special covert mission

ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitasince when was the president white
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWow....this is great!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking terrible. The story will be shit, no doubt, so the only thing they&#39;re hanging on is special effects, which look like they were supposed to be back in 2001. How did they manage to get these actors into this film? Antione Fuqua, fuck you. Training Day was awesome, all your other movies suck.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThe amount of EPICNESS in this trailer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaanyone know they ending font used?

ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaDie Hard in White House :D
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell are those shitty effects? shame
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaI personally dont think its a possibility.but for entertainment sake.unless they give good detailed plot.secondly dont think koreans or chinese opt for such bs plan.jihadists possibility is there.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaill watch it..
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!

ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaThe white knight falls.... actully sounds good. Crappy special effects though
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshita...
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaTHIS. IS. THE WHITE HOUSE!!!!
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitafeels like Bruce Willis should be in this 
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaA trend started by Homeland, will end with this movie.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitakinda reminds me of die hard hork hork
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaScotsman to save the day then.
ar-IaAx7s8kdelimeterByIshitaHARVEY DENT HAS FALLEN.
