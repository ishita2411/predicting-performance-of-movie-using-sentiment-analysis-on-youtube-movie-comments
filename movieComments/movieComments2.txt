RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaWhile this is a great piece of meta-cinema, the original (1995) story came from novelist Christopher Priest, who in turn was influenced by H.G. Wells, &quot;the Father of Science Fiction&quot;. The book concerns a prolonged feud between two stage magicians in late 1800s England. The film deserves much more exposure and credit than it gets, but it&#39;s a simplified adaptation of a more complex and celebrated novel.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS ONE SUCH FILM WHERE HUGH JACKMAN&#39;S PERFORMANCE IS EASILY OVERSHADOWED BY THIS GREAT ACTOR NAME CHRISTIAN BALE.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshita<b>The fact that Nolan himself is the magician who created this magic trick in the form of a movie is crazy.</b><br>The Pledge, the Turn, us looking for the secret which we won&#39;t find, and the Prestige.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s what multiverse looks like..<br>MCU mets with  DCU and  X-Men universe 😌❤️
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaThis is mind blowin movie.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing film. Nikola Tesla great Serbian scientist.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaThe casting of this movie is masterpiece.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaMagnum opus
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaI should have watched this first before watching Rick and Morty.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest movies of Christopher Nolan!!! 🔥🔥🔥

RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitashow de bola !!!!
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaUnpopular Opinion: While this movie does have its positives here and there, “The Prestige” is openly what I consider to be one of the most mediocre movies around. Overrated as well.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaMy god what a MASTERPIECE its is. Mr. Christopher Nolan you are a gift to this WORLD.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite twist of all

RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaImagine Tom cruise and Christopher Nolan combo in a action crime thriller
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward in this the last two movie Tenet, and Inception are great.

RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaকে্ কে অঙ্কুশের ম্যাজিক বাংলা সিনেমা দেখার  আগে বা  পর এসেছো।
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaআমি অঙ্কুশের মুভির ট্রেইলার দেখে আসছি 😒😒😒
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaThe ending  is shocking
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaIf you haven’t seen it yet, stop whatever you’re doing and watch it. You won’t regret it, I promise.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaSurprised magic trick my fav movie 😲😲😲😲, 7crore star, impossible batsman actor villain role and double role end is 777 star not boring 👍👍👍👍
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaI may not be Nolan’s work biggest fan but I have to admit that he is great at coming up with original concepts and turning them into great movies.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitacan someone convince me to watch this? Everyone raves about it but surely a movie about magicians isn&#39;t that enthralling?
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the finest ever made in Hollywood ❤️👍
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaThis is a fantastic masterpiece from Nolan and about Nicolas Tesla 👌👌👌👌<br>Don&#39;t even watch trailer💥💥💥<br>Go watch this classic now  and you won&#39;t regret❤️❤️❤️
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaBatman V Wolverine. Dawn Of Trickery.
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaSome might think Angier is Better.<br>The Others might think Borden is Better.<br>But I say Nikola Tesla is THE BEST!

RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaI miss old Hollywood before politics was prioritised over a god story. <br>:(
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaDid anybody else come here from Camp Camp? Episode 4 when Harrison shouted, &quot;I&#39;ve been &#39;Prestige&#39;-d!&quot; Just me? Okay...
RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaReason why I suggested to watch this movie :<br>1- Christopher nolan <br>2- Christopher nolan<br>3- Christopher nolan😁

RLtaA9fFNXUdelimeterByIshitaAbracadabra...
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitatoo soon hollywood.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaand the brainwashing lies continue.<br><br>There is Tons of Hardcore Evidence Which Proves that this was <b>STAGED</b> with Multiple <b>crisis Actors.</b>
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathis movie only mean one thing, bring the hatreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaa martial law conditioning movie. We are from the government! exit your home with arms raised while we search without a warrant for two pimple faced kids. April 19 1775 a band of patriots stood before the most powerful army in the world, April 19 2013 our government must force people out of their homes at muzzle point suspending the very Constitutional rights early Americans fought for.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshita900&#39;000 views and less than 1k likes, lol what
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m seeing this simply because it was filmed in my town
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t that big of a deal.. they exaggerating a bit too
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI keep thinking of April 15 2013 &amp; those 6 people that die during the Boston marathon bombing I hope this goes out to those we lost on that day they will be missed
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of Very Bad Things, never forget.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwSo64RYao&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> fav part
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI just have two questions. or three.<br><br>1. Why did they make a movie about this?<br>2. Are we going to make a movie about Sandy Hook Elementary School and every other horrible event that has ever happened?<br>3. How can they possibly make an hour and a half movie about this?
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaAs a Bostonian this trailer was emotional. Cause it brought back memories of something I wish I could forget but can&#39;t. Hopefully this would help with the healing. And seeing the bombers in the trailer (ik it&#39;s not the actual bombers) i felt something I can&#39;t describe
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThis wasn&#39;t rushed. I&#39;m from the Boston area and went through the tragedy, it feels like the right time to me. Others around the area would most likely agree as well.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshita420TH COMMENT
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWhats with the dislikes? Youtube is to popular in the 3rd world countries!
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitahmm the irony here is that not many people in Hollywood have the balls to make a movie where west bomb places like middle East, Vietnam and innocent people dying. what I call state sponsored terrorism.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathought it was a district 9 sequel lol
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitawhy is mark wahlberg always in movies based off real events
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaО боже.. Терроризм, терроризм.. Уже и так тошнит от этого, а вы тут еще и фильмы про терроризм делаете
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaToo soon
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThis looks good. I know I&#39;ll be seeing it in theaters. Love the cast also.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWas hoping this would be about super bowl 49
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaJust one mood:😢
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaHacksaw Ridge
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaPoor Jian Yang, came all the way from Silicon Valley just to be  carjacked in Cambridge.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitai&#39;d rather see a Sandy Hook movie.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s the naked dude in handcuffs?
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaFrom the title, I thought it was a movie about the election.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI hope the money made from the movie goes straight to the crisis actors. 😪
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good I just feel like it&#39;s too soon to make a movie about this.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaMelissa Benoist??
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaToo soon
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaNice!
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI remember the incident as soon as I herd it I was going to Boston but some asshole disconnected my battery capple It was probably better for me I couldn&#39;t of helped anyway so now I will see the movie and feel just as bad as I did when this horrible situation took place in Beautiful Boston the home of The Boston Red Sox these tragedies are so horrible... I this film opens eyes on how much our county does not need these senseless events happening....Good luck to the entertainment industry and the pro formers God Bless America....
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure it&#39;s an ok movie and all but does every tragedy need a movie? plus didn&#39;t Wahlberg just do Deepwater horizon?  is he the go to guy for tragic non fiction when Tom hanks isn&#39;t available?
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI saw Melissa Benoist
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWhy is this getting hate???
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwSo64RYao&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> <b><i>Supergirl?</i></b> 😂😂😂
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWhat is this movie talking about? 9/11? <br>(sorry i don&#39;t know)
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know this was a war
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaFor those of you wondering why it came out so soon. Mark Wahlberg (a person that is native to Boston) just thought that this was a huge tragedy toward his home city he loved, and I guess wanted to make the tragedy known to the world or something. So therefore he gathered up some producers that accepted the idea and eagerly made this film.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing that explosion on the new never knew it will become a movie
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m afraid that &quot;Patriot&#39;s Day&quot; does not have the same ring to it a s &quot;Independence Day.&quot; But the movie looks good.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaGlad that the make a movie on the great miracle Allah gave us. bless jihad Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Muhammad  peace be upon them
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitatalk about capitilizing on tragedy...all profits should go to the poor families who suffered
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI think this is a movie that is too soon now, but watching it a few years from now will probably have bigger impact as the bombing is still fairly fresh in minds.  It&#39;s also so weird to do it now, why not on the anniversary?  It just feels hastily forced in to this Oscar season.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaOh this is from the other guys when detective hoitz is put on traffic duty.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaLook Rachel Posner is not Dead!
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathe trailer  IS the movie lol
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaAs a Bostonian... this is a little over the top.... the Boston police did an effective job of quickly hunting down the bombers.... this wasn&#39;t a war
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI thought this was about Brady&#39;s suspension. Dissapointed.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaTRUMP
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaMatt Damon is in so many movies
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitayay, take a real tragic event and turn it into a profit business. Don&#39;t even try to justify this
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI knew they would make a movie off of the marathon bombing
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m hoping the entire Tsarnev family gets deported/executed.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThat last part made me cry.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathe new Transformer movie looks pretty edgy that&#39;s what happens when a Autobot overheats. if Michael Bay is directing this someone has to tell him that there&#39;s only one explosion
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThis is just plain rude.. Seriously, profiting off of a recent event is just too soon to be made into film.. Owell, aslong as i know the cash is somewhat going to the victims families.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWhy do I have a feeling that Ben Affleck is in this movie.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaSmell the PROPAGANDA?
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathey made World Trade Center with Nicholas Cage just 5 years after 9/11, I think releasing this almost 4 years later is just right. Good against bad in a time when the biggest countries on Earth are arguing about whether or not they&#39;re fighting for the good or bad is appropriate
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathe highway was never empty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwSo64RYao&amp;t=1m29s">1:29</a>
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaDamn it&#39;s already been 3+ years. Crazy. I think this movie is a bit too soon, but it looks good
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitamelissa benoist is getting bigger roles and tbh im not mad bout that
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI thought it was about the New England patriots...dammit.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaMelissa Benoist &lt;3
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThis will be a great movie
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaomg am crying, this brings back so much memory
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathis looks good
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaTo be politically correct, one would say that this had nothing to do with islam 🙄<br><br>Check out (civilization jihad in America, are you prepared, John Guandolo) <br><br>WAKE UP AMERICA ‼️‼️<br><br>Oh wait a minute, you voted for a man that loves America, maybe you are starting to see what&#39;s going on 🤔<br><br>Say no to islam 😎
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitait has been too short of  a time since the actual bombing. plus, with the election of trump, any negative connotation put on Muslim Americans is not helpful to them
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaNine Inch Nails brought me here
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI bawled like a baby when the kid showed up and hugged his father in the hospital, brought up personal memories.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitathis is not the right time for this movie. it may turn out to be a decent film, but now is not the time for it.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaNever imagined this was so tragic .😢
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaLook out boys Marky Mark is gonna fight these bad guys with LOVE
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaFeels like this is way too soon after the horrible incident.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaLOL Alex Wolff
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaThe timing of this movie release is just ridiculous. More propaganda. More politics. It&#39;s gonna fuel more hate. That&#39;s all it&#39;s gonna achieve, imo. Yes it was a tragedy, but there are other ways to honor the victims. This movie&#39;s gonna be bad.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaYES
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaIn a tight race, Peter Berg has taken the lead over Clint Eastwood for the title of Most Patriotic American Filmmaker.<br><br>Your move, Eastwood.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaToo soon, but still looks good.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaI like that the main guy is a normal police officer
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaTRENT REZNOR!!! (and Atticus Ross)
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshita😀

ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaSeeing that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are doing the score I might actually have to see this now.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaWonder what if Boston folks will either like or hate this movie.... hmmmm
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert.... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>After the bombings and loosing her husband, Kara becomes a reporter and then Supergirl to save the day.
ykwSo64RYaodelimeterByIshitaGood trailer. I was here when the view count was 261.

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so damn boring I couldn&#39;t even finish the trailer.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaOh my gosh, this was what I was looking for!<br> <br>I&#39;ve been trying to look for this piece of media for the past 4 or so years now! I remember seeing this trailer somewhere only once, either on tv or online and it had been stuck with me ever since. Around the early part of 2022 is when I began recalling vivid memories of this trailer and throughout the year I would periodically try to track this down. It wasn&#39;t until today while I was working on classwork that I decided to look for this trailer again, and after many searches I was quickly able to find a movie poster that looked similar to what I saw all those years ago and after deeper searching the film name I quickly found a trailer and there it was.<br> <br>Apologies if this comment sounds a bit out of place, it&#39;s just been a personal journey of mine on trying to track down something that I almost forgot about.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaماهية جديد ولا ايه
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshita2022 год?
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaFrom the look of things, he could’ve started a meth lab in that attic and nobody would’ve noticed.  Then he wouldn’t have to abandon his family and he could earned some extra $$$
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaLove the Debussy entrance.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThe ending was really bad, the only reason he got back when he saw that man approaching his wife.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBoring movie.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaMoral of the story....put curtains on your windows
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaOhhhhh man
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaFor People hating on the ending. The family&#39;s reaction isn&#39;t the whole point of the movie, it isn&#39;t the pivotal moment you should be waiting for or curious about, the whole movie is about Wakefield&#39;s arc, as well as the ending. The family&#39;s reaction will only just be a mere consequence of his choice, they could hate him for trying to selfishly find meaning in his own life, or they could embrace him, empathize with him as he&#39;s struggling to find meaning in his own life. I believe he would&#39;ve committed suicide had he not left his &quot;life&quot; in search of his own meaning of life. Would you rather see Wakefield committing suicide early on, and left his family alone forever because he failed to see the joy he would later find in his family and in his life after he had distant himself from his family? Remember, he always had the choice of not returning, but he chose to return to his family. Our fathers&#39; lives don&#39;t end as they become fathers, Wakefield&#39;s life begins as he ends what he thought was his supposed life.

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaTF i have watched?! Biggest WTF ending ever in 35 years I watch movies
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaSeriously I didn&#39;t even like the movie and just watched it to see the ending and then it had to have the worst ending imaginable...what a waste of my time
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThey ruined it with the ending. Another cliffhanger.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaIt is simply outrageous mention Doctorow and not the real creator of Wakefield: NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaWhy this movie is so underrated

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThe “food for thought” movie. A movie that will stay with you. <br>We are our own worst enemy.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaJust another peeping tom or pervert. Let Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey decide lol
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaNihilism
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaWONDERFUL MOVIE WHICH GAVE ME A HANG OVER FOR 3 DAYS. THANKS EVERYONE BEHIND THIS AMAZING MOVIE ..
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so angry that I watched the movie. The ending just ruined everything. Does that even count as an end? Its more of an unfinished movie that&#39;ll actually not get finished. Makes me feel I wasted almost 2hrs of my life.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaTHS is bad lok
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaHe could play Alan Watts.

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaSuicide is actually a form of withdraw, usually brought on by feeling that your partner withdrew (left you or is going to).

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitalooking forward to seeing it..........i love anything with Bryan Cranston! He can make a damn piece of garbage movie come alive...... The Infiltrator would not have worked with anyone other than him....it was basically Walter White&#39;s persona IMHO.

E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBen Affleck can relate ;-)
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaCranston is a genius. Definitely going to give this a watch
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaNathaniel Hawthorne gets no credit.  That&#39;s f&#39;d up.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaпотрясающе! чудесный актер
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBravo IFC for showing what looks like the WHOLE movie.... What&#39;s wrong with trailers these days?!?! Revealing EVERYTHING! Well, won&#39;t have to see it now. Done. Next.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this piano music? I keep playing the trailer to hear the piano. I want it!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitahmm... a film celebrating self-centeredness and abandonment of responsibility....
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a blue pill MGTOW movie but maybe it will surprise me and be red pill
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaAll the thumbnails for this trailer made me think it was some epic survival movie
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaque bueno sería con una traducción al español total conformidad gracias un abrazo
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitajust...WOW!<br>Can&#39;t wait!!!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBryan Cranston looks and sounds like Max Payne here. (From the third game)
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaJust don&#39;t get naked in a supermarket this time around ok.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThis is awesome crazy. Definitely going for this one! 👌👍
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitacant wait to see this movie!!!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaIs this the bridge between Malcolm In The Middle and Breaking Bad?
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitai once knew a man who would risk his life and kill and sell meth just to provide to his family , shame on you
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaI will watch anything with Bryan Cranston.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaSeriously, Cranston is the best! Omg, got me to thinking... if they ever remake The Maltese Falcon, Cranston should play Bogart! I think I would faint with happiness if that happened.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThen call Jesse pinkman and take the RV out for a batch.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitameu deus! quando estréia??? já quero ir!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaHeisenberg is back
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaWHAT AN ASSHOLE
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaesperando os comentários em português!!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitac&#39;mon, this is fugue state.......
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThis is a male version of Gone Girl.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting, I laughed out loud when he came back in with ta da and they all dropped their glasses
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThere was a movie called &#39;Gone Girl&#39; starring Ben Affleck. Now there is a movie called Wakefield (or should I call it &#39;Gone Boy&#39;) starring Jennifer Garner.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBryan Cranston is just brilliant, it a must see it!
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaBryan Cranston &lt;3
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaWhy the fuck do people not have blinds curtains ect? what the fuck is wrong with people? voyeurism is a disease best cured by the Sims...
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaOMG Cranston&#39;s voice will always be incredible.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitainteresting....
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitaThe famous Nathaniel Hawthorne story. Raul Ruiz treated that in his movie &#39;Three Lives And Only One Death&#39;. This looks good too, I&#39;ll see it.
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitawhy?!!!😲😂😬💀😂😂😱
E00DODio0WkdelimeterByIshitawasnt this already an episode of malcolm in the middle
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this to come out in cinemas
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy Dylan is getting into more serious acting, I knew he had the potential for this stuff. Him and mark will make a dynamic duo. Love them both and can&#39;t wait for this.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaeveryone saying &quot;I just came here for dylan&quot;. yes, dylan is a great actor. yes, we all love dylan. but this movie wasn&#39;t made to show off dylan or for us to say &quot;oh wow, look how hot dylan obrien is!&quot;. it was made for us to honor and remember the people who died in the oil spill. just remember that next time you want to comment &quot;I only came here for dylan&quot; :)
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaIt was a sad story. One that will be repeated. It is going to be a popcorn movie no doubt, but make no mistake. There are no heroes on a rig. Most just do it just for the money, others for the leave time (great to vacation around the world) and others for a few weeks time to escape our families and reality.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaCame for Gina.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI can already tell you that Hollywood didn&#39;t even try to tell what really happened on the drill floor...
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaeveryone here saying they came for Dylan O&#39;Brien, who&#39;s a brilliant actor with a bright future, BUT I CAME HERE FOR MY GIRL GINA WOOWOO
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaum excuse me I&#39;m gonna need a trailer with Gina in it please.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan AND Gina? Yas. &lt;3
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan will slay this entire movie
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitais Gina in this trailer?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitawho else thought that there were gonna be actual dinosaurs in this movie 😂
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see it! I&#39;m proud of Dylan but I&#39;m most excited for the movie itself. and Mark Wahlberg looks hella fine 😩
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaEveryone&#39;s here for Dylan, while I&#39;m over here for Gina 🙊
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI came here for Gina Rodrigez. I saw Dylan O&#39;Brien. Now I&#39;m definitely watching the movie
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan O&#39;brien sucks.<br><br>Fan girls in <br><br>3<br>2<br>1
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWho DF is Dylan......................this some lame crap to give empathy point of bp and how they fucked up i give no f***s about big oil corporations funding a movie..First week it&#39;s gonna say #1 movie in america like all those retarded movie critic systems. 3 stars and nonense cause they don&#39;t give out four stars like that now a days Titanic and maybe two other movies got that.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI want to watch this
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitathat little girl has no clue what she&#39;s talking about, oil and dinosaurs have nothing to do with each other.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI really was thinking this was a trailer for a really good horror/sci fi movie in the first few seconds.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will do very well . . . not only because it looks really good, but because of all the annoying fangirls that will only see the movie because they wanna ride Dylan&#39;s cock.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDYLAAAAAN
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m here only for dylan tbh
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaFuck I&#39;m excited for this movie, I agree I came here for Dylan, but after seeing this trailer I&#39;m so excited for the movie!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaSo excited for this movie! Dylan&#39;s gonna be great, Mark&#39;s gonna be great, the movies gonna be great!!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI love how most of the comments are about Dylan
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI you have ever seen mud bucked and reversed in a hole. then you have had a feeling of intensely that you never want to recreat. Imagine drilling into a oxegen bottle to find out if its full are not and for the most part all the bottles are empty except this one. I only dream about drilling these days but in my dreams I never dream of drilling a wildcat whith just seawater like the assholes at BP did and did on purpose too.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitais dylan o&#39;brien one of the main character ?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI want to see it so badly😍😫

8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks trash af

8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaNot to burst anyone&#39;s bubble but wasn&#39;t it a mistake made by these &#39;real heros&#39; that caused the largest man made environmental disaster in history in the first place..?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan 💗
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaOh Dylan my bae😍😍
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaAn Exxon/Mobil Production.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDYLAN💜
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan!!! YEEES!!!!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDYLANDYLANDYLANDYLANDYLAN!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yASbM8M2vg&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> EXPLOSIVE diarrhea
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitawho cares if you&#39;re here for dylan ?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitawe all came here for dylan, and if you say u don&#39;t then you&#39;re lying
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWait so no dinosaurs?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a load of shite!  You&#39;re going to make hero&#39;s out of BP and the idiots who created one of the largest man made disasters in history?  Give me a fucking break!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitate amo dylan te amo mi amor amor de mi vida
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, I&#39;m here for Dylan 😍
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitanow this is a great trailer
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Real heroes??&quot;  What..the...fuck?! A movie that praises a company and its workers that ALL contributed to the largest oil spill in the <b>history,</b> (that is actually STILL leaking). I have now seen it all.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so exited to see this movie, because of my husband Dylan and because it seems very cool
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaoh yas my Dyl
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDammit, they just showed me the whole movie!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaIf the movie is as bad as the trailer, it&#39;s going to be a TERRIBLE movie. What amateurish, sophomoric writing. Cringeworthy. The directing isn&#39;t much better either. The &quot;natural&quot; atmosphere of the home environment feels completely contrived, which, obviously, is the exact opposite of how &quot;natural&quot; should feel. Just to put the nail in the casket, what 9 or 10 year old watches Dora the Explorer?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWho is Dylan?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaThe dead of the workers was a terrible tragedy but, really? REAL HEROES?<br><br>Deepwater Horizon was one of the worst marine catastrophes in the history and using  the word heroes is a shame.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaJust terrible. I&#39;d be surprised if this movie isn&#39;t sponsored by BP. Not to mention this trailer is laughably bad.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDylan O Brien is at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yASbM8M2vg&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a> guys. Your welcome :))

8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitanice way to introduce a storyline. Kinda scares you
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaWow. Dylan and Mark almost look the same in their uniforms.
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaThis propaganda piece brought to you by BP oil
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaDyldo is gonna gain a wider range of fans after this. So excited lol
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaOnly here bc I&#39;m Dylan trash.. ✌
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaThis is the kind of movie my dad will watch and he&#39;ll finally understand why I&#39;m in love with Dylan O&#39;Brien. 😂
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaSo how much BP is paying for this?
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitatrailer wasn&#39;t great, hopefully movie will be
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitabefore the trailer I was like this will be boring but I&#39;ll watch it bc dylan but now the story seems actually really interesting I can&#39;t wait to watch

8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaVery suspenseful!
8yASbM8M2vgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a sequel to There will be blood film.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the background music?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaQuestion for those who&#39;ve read the book: This is all in his head, right? Cause if the monster is real, the kids at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgm20Di9Wg&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> are really chill for seeing a giant tree monster chasing after another kid.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGroot goes solo
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is that?? It&#39;s unbelievably emotional...
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitai read this book so long ago but it was still a good read and it looks like a good movie
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising. I just hope this isn&#39;t one of those &quot;it&#39;s all in his mind&quot; kind of movie.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitawow! really emotional trailer...Love the m83 song very touching!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGrooot
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m obsessed with this spanish director ever since The Orphanage and Keane&#39;s video for Disconnected. The guy is pure gold
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI am Groot
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThis is beautiful, but I can&#39;t help but see the monster as a BFG/Groot mashup
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s great to see Liam Neeson branching out.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaAn amazing Trailer a promising incredible movie, I can say that after watching this Trailer
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t expect Guardians of the Galaxy 2 to look like this...
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaNot going to lie, but this might be the BFG, Iron Giant, Guardians of the Galaxy meets horror drama sort of movie and it looks visually incredible!.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitathe big friendly tree
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe COLOURS!! THE VISUALS! So beautiful.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaDesigned to make you cry. Read the book and ditch the CGI-fest...
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI AM GROOT!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaLiam Treeson
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshita&quot;The iron Giant&quot; meets &quot;Groot&quot; meets &quot;Pans Labyrinth&quot;... nice effort though. Stop making trailers that expose the whole plot.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaDude, add a M83 song and it changes everything. This movie looks amazing!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaPatrick Ness?! HOLY SHIT! Does this mean we&#39;ll get a Chaos Walking movie soon?! XD XD XD
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaas someone who has made child hood characters actually a whole universe <br>this gives me reason to cry tenfold

WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitajust came because M83 song
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI absolutely love the book, and it looks as if I&#39;m going to love the movie as well.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitais this one of those stories where the monster is a metaphor and the kid is just imagining him because if it is I&#39;m gonna be real disappointed
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshita<b>I AM GROOT!!!!</b>
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI need to read the book. Like, now.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaSeriously someone is cutting onions in here. Please stop doing that.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitahe looks like groot
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s years since i read a rumor that they were going to do a movie about the book, and now it&#39;s real!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaRemember to hydrate before watching this.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGroot? Is that you?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitahohohohooooo back up there buddy. What was with them viz effects at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgm20Di9Wg&amp;t=2m19s">2:19</a> huuuuuuh? Why are those in the trailer???? When you have a giant tree monster that looks like it been rendered by god??? What are thoooooooooooose?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaM83!!!!!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitahow is this different from BFG?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaSong is &quot;M83 - Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun&quot;
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaCan someone PLEASE tell me the music of this trailer, whether it&#39;s a score or a band
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaRight in the feels.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe monster looks like Groot but he sounds like Sentinel Prime!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWhen you think you&#39;re gonna watch a trailer to a scary movie but half way you realize that the movie will probably make you cry. 😭
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks INCREDIBLE.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaLooks superb. However, am I the only one reminded of the movie Paperhouse?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGroot got a solo film.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe Iron Giant crossed with Bridge to Terabithia. All of them make me cry
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThis is incredible! Without even watching the whole movie I give it 5 stars!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaawesome
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI came here from gizmodo to down thumb this crap.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaDamn, the trailer itself made me wanna shed some man tears. Just think of how the movie will be gadamn!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI am Groot.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know what the music is at the start of the trailer?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWould it kill these filmmakers to cast a little boy of another ethnicity? I&#39;m 40 now and literally all my life I&#39;ve watched little white Boys have all the great dreams and adventures or always be the chosen one to save this or that...I want one that at least I can relate to or my kids a little more.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaRead the book and thought it was amazing, can&#39;t wait to see this!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaKinda reminds of Bridge To Terabithia.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaDamn, them feels...... This looks really fucking good!!!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve read the book and if they are going to make it it better be damn good
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWhen a trailer can choke you up, you know the movie itself has gotta be good
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThis is BFG in GOOD. Thank you!!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI was crying like a fucking little baby while watching this trailer! I LOOOOOOVED THE BOOK, and now I&#39;m sure that I will ADORE the movie! :D
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaDamn, the feels. The book was a wonder in my eyes, and I am so eagerly excited for this.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI am Groot
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitabecause of it is I can spoil everything
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI think this movies is made by book called 7 min after midnight
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI cant even begin to begin to understand why anyone would thumbs down this trailer. Its perfect
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson HAS to voice Unicron in a Transformers movie!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaHere come the waterworks!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaAnnnnnnnndddddd im crying

WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve read this..it&#39;s actually not that great I mean it&#39;s ok but more so so....Farley boring
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks like its gonna be amazing
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaEvery trailer gets better with a M83 song!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI am Groot.
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaTOBY
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaCuando me enteré que habría película, sentí miedo, pero al ver la producción, música y actuaciones no puedo esperar más para verla, va a ser muy leal al libro!😍
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe Neverending Story of the new millennium? I like it!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaWow! can&#39;t wait for this!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitakek
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else got an Iron Giant vibe when the Monster started talking and such?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sold to this film
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGroot the Movie
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaIs that how the monster is described in the book? Cause he definitely looks like a super sized Groot. But since Liam Neeson is voicing him, its all good!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe spoiler Trailer couldn&#39;t resist..hun
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgm20Di9Wg&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> its Felicity Jones character holding on Conor&#39;s hand?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaGiants are evil
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaThe Best introducere by Liam Neeson before the Previous Of the new. A Monsters Calls trailer! It seems to be very amazing Dark fantasy
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI AM GROOT!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitathis looks fantastic !
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaBeen a long time since a trailer made me cry. This realy got me in the feels twice. Then I watched it again: onions! I love this trailer, and I&#39;m going to see this movie. <br>And does anyone know where i can get the instrumental that plays thru this whole thing, cuz wow!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitasong?
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaI urge everyone to read the book, it&#39;s pretty short and absolutely stunning (plus the illustrations are magnificent). Thrilled to see the movie shaping up so well!
WMgm20Di9WgdelimeterByIshitaOh great a movie about a insane boy
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaRight on WB! Great trailer!!!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaTom Hanks collaborates with very good directors. Paul Greengrass, Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitafinally!!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell they took the main character just like sully from uncharted lol
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI aw this movie already. It was called FLIGHT.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshita&quot;It&#39;s okay to go in the butt every once in a while.&quot; -  Viggo Mortensen
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitasublime
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaYeah okay just gonna land a huge air plane on a river.  Great movie concept...not.  who thoughts of this crap?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWay to shit on the real story...Pilots don&#39;t train for this? Sure they do, all the time...he could have landed somewhere? Bull...he was drinking? Bull...this movie (based on the trailer) just looks like it&#39;s shitting on Sully for the sake of BS drama in order to take a six minute thing and stretch it out to movie length...shame on them.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI remember that day telling my father, this landing is a miracle, he just laughed and said whatever. Weeks later I was right.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaDude omg I thought this was a movie based on uncharted sully and Nathan Drake. Come to think of it, that would be a badass movie hunting for treasure called Uncharted
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitabro
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitanro
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitawhere is Nathan Drake where is My beo
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThis is just Flight but with Tom Hanks instead of Denzel
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshita...I&#39;m also waiting for the sequel, Unsullied
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaIs this the middle-aged, white version of Flight?  hehe
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaOnly about 5 years too late on this one...The real incident happened in 2009 with people comparing this movie to Flight. How soon people forget.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaSullyman Magnificul =)))))
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was Sully from Monsters Inc.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it will be a great film. I think Tom Hanks might get another nomination for best actor.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaso is this a true story ??
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaYOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING FUNNY WITH THE UNCHARTED JOKES LOL I&#39;M DYING HERE<br><br>You&#39;re not funny.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitadid they live?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaYeh but where is his red Hawaiian shirt?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshita&quot;El Goddamn Dorado!&quot;
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaOSCARS OSCARS EVERYWHERE
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaSully from Uncharted
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaNext one to comment with an Uncharted reference gets a prize.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThese poor people reading the comments that have never played Uncharted.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThat dude&#39;s a hero. Glad they made a film with a big-time actor to portray him.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaDid they died?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaIs this the Uncharted 4 DLC
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThis is so stupid. Everyone watching already knows what happens, nobody died, there&#39;s very little story to go on as it is. It&#39;s just another excuse to pay Tom Hanks millions of dollars. Where&#39;s the tension? At least the movie Flight was an original script with more working pieces beyond the actual plane crash.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks interesting!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaVictor &quot;GODDAMN&quot; Sullivan!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWhen did Sullivan became an actor?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaReally very nice👌👌
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWow ,another Tom hanks movie :O hype!!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitawell am sold
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitathis guy never disappoint
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI hate flying, this movie is only adding to that. Thanks!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was Sully From Uncharted 4.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThought this would be a throw away cash grab. I mean how could such an event span a two plus hour movie. I had no idea all this other crap happened after the crash. This went from a might catch it on cable to gotta go see it in the theater.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. Had no idea he faced all those troubles after saving so many lives. A shame the FAA/His bosses wanted to tear him down instead of thanking him for this miraculous feat.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaLook at me, I am the captain now
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThe white version of Flight pretty much
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaLooks great.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaMissing Nathan Drake but it looks good.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI came looking for a monsters inc spinoff
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaNossa esse filme vai ser mt bom
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitait looks a little bit like FLIGHT
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaUncharted? lmao
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaWow, the new Uncharted looks tight.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI totally didn&#39;t think this was based on sully from monsters inc
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaIs this about uncharteds sully?
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaStill waiting for an Uncharted movie...
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjKEXxO2KNE&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a> Gran Torino is on the left.  Clint Eastwood put an ad for his older movie in his newer movie
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks intense..can&#39;t wait to watch it.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaMy boy Tom Hanks reeling in the money this year!
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI expect a Nathan Drake cameo
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI thought sully from monster Inc got his on movie
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was a Monsters Inc. spin-off
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaSo... It&#39;s not an Uncharted movie? I guess I&#39;ll go back to sleep
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m getting too old for this crap, Nate&quot;
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got 40 years in the air, but in the end I&#39;m going to be judged on 208 seconds.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like there`s lots of padding in this.Birds hit engine, captain lands plane.The end.
mjKEXxO2KNEdelimeterByIshitaFlight 2.0

dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitamarvel y dc😮
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaJust give Oscar to Will Smith for real this time!!!!!!
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a lot of heavy hitters in this movie. Looks great. I&#39;m not a Star Wars fan (never grew up watching it except for Revenge of the Sith and TFA), so I&#39;ll be seeing this before Star Wars.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaHoly molly! Will Smith is gone gray. I&#39;ve though he&#39;ll stay young for awhile.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThe first character Will Smiths played in awhile whose supposed to be charismatic, and he&#39;s someone who&#39;s suffering from major depression. Ok Hollywood
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaWill back on a bike again
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaWow will smith again??
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaseems boring..
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaI wish Death gave him a scythe, then he becomes a soul reaper and fights ghost, demons, and negative emotions.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitasequel/prequel to suicide squad confirmed?
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaanyone else feel like this is gonna be The Ghosts of Christmas Past
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaRare it is when such great trailers come... Too much hopes from the movie, what a Cast simply overwhelming.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaSorry I cant take her seriously after movie 43
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitawait so this movie is basicly about the guy who invented the domino rali? and will smith is the inventor right?
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThe Pursuit of Happyness part 2

dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaOscar bait. But the script is nice.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitapromising.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaWhy are they all white ????? This movie is racist . <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23blacklivesmatter">#blacklivesmatter</a>
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaI swear to god, if his friend hired those people, this is gonna be the most shamelessly emotionally manipulative movie since the Blind Side.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaYou get that Oscar Will Smith
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like such a great movie. I hope it doesn&#39;t disappoint.

dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks amazing!
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaTrailer is way too long. I wish they would actually make better trailers not this 3 min description of the whole movie. (Dosent mean I don&#39;t like the movie)
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaLooks nice :)
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaDoes Edward Norton even age? He has looked the same since 2000

dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitawoaw amazing cast and from the spotlight producer.i think this film gonna win at least 2 oscar
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaFor anyone wondering, since it&#39;s from one of the best trailer composers ever, the song name is &quot;Remember Me&quot; by Thomas Bergersen
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitahello
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaAll I see is Hollywood actors, not characters. Cant take this movie seriously.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaMichael Pena is the Hispanic version of Samuel L. Jackson.   He&#39;s like the designated Hispanic male actor for big movies lol.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaJada&#39;s gonna be mad if Will doesn&#39;t get an Oscar nod for this.
dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitaIs an good film huumm !!!!<br>I should see this film !

dpFyds_pS2EdelimeterByIshitahi Im first
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaI saw this in theaters.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaJack Sparrow races to recover the heart of Davy Jones to avoid enslaving his soul to Jones&#39; service, as other friends and foes seek the heart for their own agenda as well.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite part ☺️
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaThe Cannibal Island was always my favorite part in the movie to watch. Even though that part of the movie has no big impact on the story, it&#39;s still a great thing to watch in this series. It&#39;s something thrilling for the audience to enjoy in an adventure. Would&#39;ve been cool if we got an entire movie of this characters just on that island trying to escape.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaForever one of the greatest action adventure movies of all time
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaSo Davy Jones became the Minister of Magic in his next birth..
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaSeen this pirates of the Caribbean 2 movie with my brother &amp; mom in New Jersey’s wildwood theaters on the board walk
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaThis is how you do a trailer, show the audience tiny glimpses of the story, not the whole plot. Nowadays you&#39;d know what was in the chest, Will&#39;s father is on the Dutchman, and that Jack dies before ever seeing the actual movie.

SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaone of the very best pirates of the Caribbean movies ever

SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaApart from Curse of the Black Pearl, this is my favourite film of the Carribbean series.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaCool movie trailer
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaI bet no one expected Barbossa&#39;s return in this movie...
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaVFX still hold up by today standards. Honestly a damn near perfect movie to me. Aged like fine wine.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaBlockbuster trailer vs excellent movie rating star 1 crore👍👍👍
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaEpic Trailer but Very Epic Movie

SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaim gonna miss johnny depp as jack sparrow
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshita개같은 세상.. 피 토하는 음악..ㄴㄱ
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaHated how they just gave away Jones’ look in this trailer in full view. Would’ve been much cooler to witness it in theaters. For this trailer they should’ve only include shots of him turned away, and give one or two tiny hints of his face at the very end.
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshita“Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest”. From producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Johnny Depp. Keira Knightley. Orlando Bloom in a Gore Verbinski film.”
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaI miss 2006
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaUhhmmmmm
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaUhhh
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaWhat score film at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNA-Ezahmok&amp;t=0m02s">0:02</a>
SNA-EzahmokdelimeterByIshitaFirst
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitanein, nein, nein, nein!!!!!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaWorst war movie I have ever scene. The trailer lied to us and it was a huge let down, even for Quentin Tarantino.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaFreaks and geeks season 2
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitathey made this movie look too much like the expendables in this trailer..... which it was not. still great though
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita Some people think that this method of war is efficient. It&#39;s completely wrong, methods like this have been proven by all to be very inefficient, that&#39;s right, by every single regime or power that ever applied them, it ended badly. Methods like this only strengthen the opposing power because they can use the evidence to show how violent and uncivilized the persecutors are. <br><br>This is one of the reasons I don&#39;t like this movie, even the allies knew this and they never went through with it.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaWorst war movie ever, and don&#39;t give this BS about how it got good reviews and shit, I fucking hated it.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaOoh, that&#39;s a Bingo!!!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI hate how he refers to them as &#39;the German&#39;. Nazis and Germans are not the same thing, Germany was simply the first country the Nazis conquered. Frustrates me.  
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaTarantino is a fuckin sick maniac! Toom much violence in his movies! He needs a doctor!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitathis trailer is extremely misleading! if you want brad pitt and awesome violent scenes and english dialogue don&#39;t see this film. it&#39;s mostly in french and isn&#39;t good for sleepovers (from experience) 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaA lot of deleted scenes in this trailer¡¡
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThat smirk the Bear Jew makes imagining the evil he will get to do soon gets me everytime. 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis is an incredibly mean antisemitic movie because Jewish people, at least the majority like every other people, are better than that. These &quot;Jews&quot; look like the way Hitler described them : a bit like he was when he was Fuhrer. Only communists could like this movie very much, because they want Jews to be like the characters in the movie : not Jews who respect Human&#39;s Rights (like most of my Jews friends here in France) but Jews who support Socialists and Communists ideas (the rest of &quot;Jews&quot;, they are not worth to be named so, otherwise &quot;Jew&quot; could mean a fine or an evil people, which is nonsense, it should only mean fine people). What I said for the Jews is also valuable for Black people : in the movie, the Black dude looks more like an African Islamist or a gangster (a sort of communist once again), not like the humble common Africans living in Africa or anywhere else.   <br>Humanity suffers not only from Nazis but also because anti-Nazis are not all good : otherwise, it would have been a long time that things would have gone well, but it&#39;s not the case. Tarantino has made a communist propaganda that even Americans, French and etc. find great and when communists will obtain full power, it will be too late : Tarantino, Brad Pitt, etc. will be still stars but the rest humanity will endure terrible pain and there will be no-one able to stop the massacres, the famine, etc that happen in communist states. We must stop it right now : Tarantino&#39;s movie must be forbidden and only people worth of criticizing Nazis (the best movies : Schindler&#39;s List, The pianist which are also against communism) must be listened to.           
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t like this very much. It wasn&#39;t bad but didn&#39;t have enough action.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaWhen jew smashes skull of a random German guy thats OK.<br>This film is bullshit and full of hatred, not only towards nazis but also to all Germans.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaBetter than Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitafucken one of the worst war movies I&#39;ve ever scene and probably the biggest let down when it comes to movies.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is almost like one of those parody recut trailers where they make Mary Poppins look like a horror or The Shining look like a family movie... This trailer blatantly lies and makes the movie look like something it&#39;s not. The main character of Inglorious Basterds was Shosanna and she&#39;s only glimpsed once for about half a second in the whole trailer. 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrRy6kSFF0&amp;t=0m32s">0:32</a> is he from The office?
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNein,Nein,Nein,Nein!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrRy6kSFF0&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a> guy from cobra 11 :D
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie....loved it!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI came here from Robot Chicken<br><br>Damn I love Robot Chicken for showing me this
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI HATE THE USA
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitai see map keno der toten !
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaGorlomi
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaWell... this is the best fucking movie I&#39;ve fucking seen in a long fucking time. FUCK!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaHahaha the owl commercial, &quot;WHO?&quot; haha anyone else see it?
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis makes it seem like just a bloody action movie but it&#39;s really so much more than that.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaMost EPIC trailer Iv&#39;e ever seen in my life! :D
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaHonestly, If I had seen this trailer instead of the other &quot;official&quot; one, I would never have watched the movie. Sorry its a pretty bad trailer and the -to my mind- real star in it, Christoph Waltz isn&#39;t even mentioned! 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaMy uncle was in the Army Air Corps in World War II and my father was a combat infantryman in France.  I wonder how many scalps they got.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaFucking love this film. This, Django Unchained, and Pulp Fiction are my three favourite Quentin Tarantino films.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita&quot;Each n every man under my command, owes me one hundred nazi scalps...and I want my scalps!&quot;
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaFavourite film ever
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita...not sure about grammar nazi, but we do have two spelling nazis here.. :)
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaProbably a deleted scene. A lot of movies put deleted scenes in their trailers.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita1:09 That part doesn&#39;t even happen in the movie.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaokay this is a kinda funny :P
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaScalps. Owes me one hundred Nazi scalps.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI think you broke the internet....
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita19 people were scalped
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThe scene with the dude running and firing the machine gun...that wasn&#39;t in the movie...
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is nothing like the trailer. 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitais this film any good? ive got the dvd but this trailer just doesnt get me going!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN!

Sound good?

NEIN.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s grammar not grammer
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaand i want my scalps :D
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNathan Sykes sent me here...
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita1:01 hyuuga neji
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaryan from the office?
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaDjango first
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaQT
1. Inglorious Basterds
2. Pulp Fiction
3. Kill Bill 
4. Django Unchained
5. Reservoir Dogs
6. Death Proof

I&#39;d half-finished Jackie Brown.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s too much of SHIT
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaAnd I want my scalpes!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitahow punny
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaHe is part of the Inglourious Grammers 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaClassic, ain&#39;t it?  It&#39;s like, &quot;I AM in your house, and I DID get your permission, but MY pipe is bigger than yours.&quot;
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThe nein nein nein nein part was the best.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitagrammar.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaIt is not.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitait wasn&#39;t a grammar mistake
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita1:10 never happened in the movie -__- i was quite angry at that.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI got him in my sights.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThe problem with Inglourious Basterds is one of misinformation.  The trailer makes it seem as though you&#39;ll be seeing an action movie, where what you get is more akin to a thriller.  At first I was turned off to this movie by that, but I watched it again, and tried to enjoy it.  And suddenly, Christoph Waltz was one of my favorite actors, Hans Landa my favorite bad guy, and Inglourious Basterds my favorite movie.  The tension created in the first scene and the bar scene is unforgettable.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaone of the best films I&#39;ve seen
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitathats pathetic
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis film is perfection
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita1:07 That smile.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNow, i&#39;m going to go sprint to the video store :&#39;)
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m NOT trying to defend the Nazi party in anyway. However I do want to point out that not every Nazi solider was part of the Nazi party because he wanted to be. Many of them were forced. Many of the people working under Hitler knew what he was doing was wrong and tried to stop him. The movie &#39;Valkyrie&#39; is an example of this.
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshita0:11 - 0:16 name of the track, please?
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitahe was correcting someone who didnt know what the guy said... i dont think that counts as being a grammar nazi

KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThe slight noise, when &#39;Activate,Infiltrate, and Exterminate&#39; came on the screen made this trailer
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNo its Anti-Nazi
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaanti german
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaIt is. It&#39;s just few seconds when they introduce the guy who did the MG rush.

KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a  spelling error, not grammar;) 
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaNAI. NAI NAI NAI NAI NAI NAI!
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaIt was a sad, funny and totally a good movie
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer ia a great example of how you inspire people to watch a movie.
Fuck the Nazis, Quentin Tarantino is a genius !
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitalol....theres big difference between knows and owes fool...its not like these/those ;)
KnrRy6kSFF0delimeterByIshitatotelly

hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaI think this film is going to be shit :(
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaMusic?
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitalooks sooooo sick!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaIf ever there was a definition for &quot;Amazeballs&quot;, it would be this.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaПридётся идти, на такую-то красоту.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaBIG a** action set pieces. Wow!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaIf ever there was a definition for &quot;Amazeballs&quot;, it would be this.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaH-how does this movie keep escalating with each trailer?
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaI thought I was having a heart attack and this was only a trailer.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitait looks bigger and better than i expected, it makes my imagination go short
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8&amp;t=1m54s">1:54</a> <br>Holy FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br>The hypest hype you could ever get hype.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitai fucking want to arise from the ashes of this world too!!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaThis has to be the best trailer I have ever seen.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaHOLY<br>LORD 
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaMother of God that was amazing
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshita300 views and 1000 likes? Seems legit. 
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaBy far one of my most anticipated films, I can&#39;t WAIT!!!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaspeechless
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaHoly shit balls!! This looks awesome.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaoh look Tom Hardy&#39;s wearing a mask.... haven&#39;t seen that before...wait
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually happy that they have rehashed a lot of the other trailer&#39;s footage because they&#39;re not showing to much &amp; leaves a bit of speculation going into the film.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaHave a feeling this movie gonna be EPIC! I will be buying a ticket May 3. As well as the Blu-ray combo pack. And yes WE NEED THAT MAD MAX VIDEOGAME!!!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaImmortan Joe is breeding albinos with the harem? 
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaYes. 
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaGet stoned and watch this movie, and thank me later
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaAnd the award for greatest trailer of all time goes to....
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaplease god, this trailer not be better than the movie!, pleasee!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitathis movie looks absolutely amazing bring it on 😃 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MadMax">#MadMax</a> 😃
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaJesus.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaWarner Bros has really given us sooo much footage with these trailers. They could have ended it with the first one six months ago and they would have kept the story tight and the interest high. I smell the panic from the executives scared of not getting their money back on this R rated 100 million dollar gamble. Regardless, George Miller is going to give us fans what we want, the executives and producers will have to suffer. That is the sign of a real director.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer that gives some hint of the storyline.  The action scenes are a given, my concern is will it have enough &#39;story&#39; to see more than once?
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaI just found my Heaven.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaCan   Not   Wait.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitafucking awesome!!!!!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaMax me. Max me good.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer but it feels like they&#39;re showing way too much.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKKKKK FUFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKKKK!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s mad bro
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaI forgot how to breath
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaThat scene of the Interceptor being restored after it was totaled is an image I wanted to see since the end of Mad Max 2. For me the interceptor is like Max&#39;s pale horse.
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaHumungus don´t like Bane masks
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitaDamn! looks amazing!
hEJnMQG9ev8delimeterByIshitai hope mel gibson makes a cameo and this looks great!

YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitathe theory of inception is actually a real theory if some ones teaching it I&#39;m learning it
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaIn Nolan we trust.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitai dont think nolan will ever be able to surpass this masterpiece.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaIf you liked this movie you should check Paprika. Inception got inspired a lot from the Paprika anime. There is an trailer for Paprika with inception music...check it out.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThis is better than porn.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaque filme 😍
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaBest Nolan&#39;s Movies:<br>1. The Prestige<br>2. Inception<br>3. Memento
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitabest trailer ever
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitabest heist movie of all time
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaI watched the revenant because it had both Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy in it. and guess the fuck what? you bet your ass imma watch this for the exact same reason
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThis is only 5 years old, it&#39;s NOT A &quot;CLASSIC TRAILER&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a lucid dreamer, and when I learn to FULLY control my dreams, I&#39;m going to take a group of my friends and perform an inception to a random dream character XD It should be pretty sick if I don&#39;t get too unstable (;
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaBOOOOOWN is the new &quot;In a world...&quot;
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaI have watched the movies more than 5 times and still came to watch the trailer. I am totally obsessed with this movie
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaall the trailers spoil the movie so i dont watch them
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t really get this movie when I first saw it.<br><br>- so it&#39;s.. Cobb&#39;s job is to penetrate the subconscious of a person through a dream and plant an idea in there?
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThis movie was inspired from animation called &quot;Paparika&quot;
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaVanomas is here! He`s watching you!
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitathis must be one of the few movies that lived up to thr exitement of its trailer.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaLOORMINARTY CONFIRMED M8
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaInception BWAAAAA BWAAAAAAA....<br><br>Actually its call Extraction...
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaInception&gt;Interstellar&gt;The Dark Knight
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitathanks to this trailer now every action movie trailer will has this dunn... dunn... as their background music
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaDreams feel real while we&#39;re in them.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThe movie is only real when Caprio is recruiting his people and the last scene when he wakes up in the airplane. <br>The rest, is a dream.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThe Dark Night Rises and guests
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitawhere was i in 2010 and 2008 i wish i can go back in time and watch this much of creativity and prefection
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaAnd they say dilwale is the same.. such a bullshit...
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThe gun at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoHD9XEInc0&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> looks like a Slak 7H from Modern Combat 5
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaits better than the dark knight but i prefer the dark knight because faboy reason
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaBest trailer ever?
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaمو حلووووو
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaMatrix is Inception
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaMatrix + Micheal Bay = Inception

YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaAll time favorite!
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes this movie look shit<br>But it&#39;s really not tho
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaInception &gt; The Dark Knight &gt;&gt; Interstellar
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaJust reminds me of Paprika
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaThe origin of the &quot;BAAWNNNNN BAWNNNN&quot; in trailers
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitai had alwayz in LIMBO and then             <br><br>i forget it.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaNear perfect film!
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitabest movie ever. Nolan is a genius. and the cast phenomenal. plus absolutely great soundtrack.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy in the end haha too good
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitabwaaa
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaIn a world...
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaI have a question that you will be released sequel of this movie and if comes out when?
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitaBest Chris Nolan tied with TDK imo.
YoHD9XEInc0delimeterByIshitagood effects and a clever script with a surprisingly open end.

ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshita&quot;There hasn&#39;t been a ghost sighting in 30 years.&quot;<br><br>Cute.
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaNever saw the originals so maybe my opinion becomes a little less valid buttt this movie looks awesome!
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaOk. This actually looks pretty interesting.<br><br>I might actually watch this.

ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaGHOSTBUSTER : THOR<br>GHOSTBUSTER 2 : ANTMAN
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks GREAT!!!! Is that a devil dog leg I see????? Hmmmmm?? Who YOU gonna CALL!?
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaSony: Releases trailer<br>Me after watching: It´s salt.
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitawaited for it. GHOSTBUSTERS.
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaTHANK YOU JASON.
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaSe ve que va a estar buena
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaDon’t know how I feel about this, too many child actors and the ghostbusters better not be children   And it’s not showing us much “ghost busting”
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaSuperb one......2020<br><br>It&#39;s marvelous
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaLooks waaay better without this clown woooooomaaaaaans.
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaEat my shorts, Leslie Jones
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P. Harold Ramis, this was the sequel you were supposed to be in.

ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaWow. I&#39;m surprised by the lack of comedy. Not in a bad way. I appreciate the new, more somber take
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty promising. I’m most likely gonna see it. Also, I’m getting flashbacks from Stranger Things 2😂
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaAtleast they have managed to show us something ... This movie demands some great deal with vfx .... and the vfx production has just started .....
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaFOR EGON
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaWhat they call em “GHOSTBUSTERS !!”
ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting...They are going with a serious tone with this one

ahZFCF--uRYdelimeterByIshita&quot;There hasn&#39;t been a ghost citing in 30 years&quot; - does this mean the Paul Fieg movie isn&#39;t canon?

DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaI stand with the grandparents.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaFor Frodo!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaYessss!!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSaw the title and thought it&#39;s another superhero film. Fighting against your relatives and the system and just trying to keep your family together i realised it is.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks absolutely precious!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaAragorn high af, thinking he is a hippie and shit
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaRated R? 😕
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitathis is already making me cry.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitawhen you talk to takeo from cod zombies <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHJuC8U8CHU&amp;t=0m43s">0:43</a>
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a weird name for this type of movie, i was expecting a superhero movie lol
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaI fave a feeling this will make me cry my ass off haha
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaAnd now for a movie where I am meant to root for the hippie.... but I will not.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitatypical american hill billy story
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaLet them watch that video from the 90&#39;s of kids teaching the internet
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshita... why watch the movie, when you can watch the trailer instead.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaI seriously thought this would be a stupid humor comedy
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSo this is what Aragorn did after becoming King of Gondor...
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThat looks like a fun life..
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitathis is probably The Room...just with romance and comedy :|<br>but i dont know though,will watch it anyways lmao
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaLegolas is in a movie
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened to the King Of Gondor ??? Where his queen lady Arwen ???
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThanks for showing the entire movie. I liked it. :)
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a wonderful family movie.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitarip off of Alaskan bush people the shows already bad enough why did you have to make a movie like it
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaOne does not simply take away the kids of Aragorn...
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s not a Hillbilly, he&#39;s a Hippie. <br><br>Let&#39;s all glorify the Hippies. Because they did our culture so much good in the 60&#39;s.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaAragorn would make a perfect solid snake in a movie
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaaww man this movie looks filled to the brim with emotion. I&#39;m excited.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitathis guy kept his family away from the world?! That&#39;s fucked up. I&#39;m on grampa&#39;s side
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThis is lovely :-*<br>I mean, I know that they seem to be fighting in the movie. But its about them fighting to love the other person their way. We kinda need a little more of this in the world, if at all.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what the song is called?
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie advocating for children not to go to school? If  so, that&#39;s really messed up.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaWas I the only one expecting a superhero movie with that title? lol
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHJuC8U8CHU&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> WTF!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSounds like a smart movie.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaI really want him to be Joel in &#39;The Last Of Us&#39; movie...can&#39;t see anyone who would be better.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s weird when you see a trailer and already knows you&#39;re going to love the soundtrack
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitathat whole family looks like they need a good bath
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for these movies to come out since there a lot of them coming out this year
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re taking his children to ISENGARD!!!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSHIT! Its one of them :/
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a tear-jerking one already.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitapara mi viggo es argentino... aunque no halla nacido acá...
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitathought this was going to be a movie about Elton John
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaA lot of the recent movies look like shit, but this one actually looks decent!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaSong For Zula ,is the first soundtrack used in trailer incase you&#39;re wondering :)
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaIs that pewdiepies beard?!?!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaFOR FRODO!!!
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaI swear I thought this was going to be another shitty parody of Captain America
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaonly me think that it is mr.fantasric from fantastic 4?
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaLoving the cancerous hipster music for these trailers.
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaThat looks refreshing
DHJuC8U8CHUdelimeterByIshitaAnd because the movie is made by creative types, the dumb hippy will win in the end.

2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitagreat story..
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies I have ever watched in my life,definitely recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.I just finished watching it and my head is spinning because the end was just a surprise didn&#39;t expect it to end that way. Its definitely a must watch guys.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaHer DNA can be found on the wine bottle in the crazy highschool boyfriends house.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaCan anybody recommend me messed up movie like this?
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie had such a great story to it...
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaHis wife is kidnapped by The Joker. Hahahaha.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaAfter Basic Instinct this movie is the only film I&#39;ve come across that justifies this particular genre. A great piece of art, please do watch it.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer shows too much I think
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaEverything about this movie is perfect. The casting, the soundtrack and the whole story. Another great film from David Fincher. Personally I dislike it when books are turned into movies. Very rarely I will enjoy and be happy with the movie adaptation as most movies just don&#39;t get it right and end up ruining the whole thing. But this film I would say got it right and has to be one of my most favourite movies of all time!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaJoe Rogan was talking about this movie, and I&#39;ve never seen it. Gotta check it out, now.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaGreat work by FINCHER but end of the movie is somewhat ambiguous!!!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaAfter watching this movie, I realized I better find the right woman in my life, cautiously. LOL! It was amazing, funny, yet suspenseful! Sensing a sequel coming up in the future. :)
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaHe killed her 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaWow Nick really had me worried! It was awesome how it ended, I wouldn&#39;t have written it that way. I am not sure if you call that ending &quot;Happily Ever After?&quot;
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI read the book and it was a masterpiece!!!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaMind-blowing screenplay !<br>Ben affleck awesome as usual, Rosamund Pike definitely an oscar winner this year !
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI really enjoyed the book. The film was even better though. David Fincher confirmed himself as a genius. All the actors were so good. Rosamund Pike, especially, really deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of Amy Dunne. She was so scary! I haven&#39;t actually seen &quot;Still Alice&quot; yet, so I can&#39;t judge Julianne Moore&#39;s performance. However Rosamund gave one of the most impressive performances of 2014 imo.  
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI am so desperate to see this film! It looks sooo good! I am currently reading the book and it&#39;s ace! 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GoneGirlGoneWild">#GoneGirlGoneWild</a><br><br>Gillian Flynn, New York&#39;s #1 Selling Author of &quot;Gone Girl&quot;...<br>Made me think the difference of the human behavior towards LOVE and FORGIVENESS, with a different kind of twist or should I say SLICE?<br><br>After browsing the book, couldn&#39;t helped to watch directly the movie... Because my curiosity itched like never before, eyes arr so hungry for visuals, need to outburst the excitement inside.<br><br>Indeed, Ben Affleck&#39;s creativity is getting sharper, with every movie he makes. I must say you can not IGNORE this movie even the Book.<br><br>Applause to The author, BRAVO! Employing her trademark razor-sharp writing and assured psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.<br><br>Grab some popcorn or have some movie night with pals or partners...<br>RFLAX, SIT BACK and ENJOY the movie.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>Till next movie date right only here .. @CouchFab2Toe
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI dunno why but Tyler Perry kind of reminds me of Seth Rogen.lol
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshita
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaLooks brilliant. Gotta watch it.. 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched the movie this afternoon with my friend at the theater and i must say that its scarily funny... Good movie!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaunbelievable!!!! That&#39;s really unbelievable!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI kept thinking Taylor Swift Rosamund played Amy.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaSUCH A TWISTED FILM IT WAS AMAZING 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie tonight. It is AMAZING. Honestly 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaSaw it tonight , it was GREAT
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaMore like psycho girl
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaThis film blew my mind. Amazing. 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie earlier today and can&#39;t get over how much I liked it. Although I am far from an expert, Rosamund Pike deserves an Oscar nod at the very least. 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie. Ben Affleck was awesome. So absolutely unlikeable.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaDark, smart, intense, thrilling, sexy and manipulative movie which shows and explores complexities of life, marriage, media, friendships and psychology. It is a phenomenal ride from start to end, it keeps you guessing who and why and when, always respects the audience, and doesn&#39;t leave loose ends. Writing is great, cinematography is gorgeous, direction is stunning, cast is top notch with Rosamund Pike being the best she&#39;s ever been. My only minor issue is that maybe they went overboard little bit in the end. Nevertheless Gone Girl is one of the best films this year, GO SEE IT. 4,5/5.
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaJust started reading the book and so far enjoying it. I am also looking forward to seeing the movie. 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaHOW FAR CAN A 40-year-old WOMAN GO<br>... TO GET PREGNANT ...<br><br>( the summary of this movie in one sentence :)

2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI would like to see this one!!!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaWow. Amazing! 
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaAffleck is cast well. He gives off a bit of a Scott Peterson vibe.

2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaThe book was AMAZING! They better do Gillian Flynn justice. Props to Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne as narrators for the audiobook. Movie better be just as good
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitathis looks beyond amazing!!!! cannot wait to see it!!!!
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good <br>But I wonder if idiots are going to ask if this is a Tyler Perry movie since he is in it. ‪#‎Liketheydoeveryothermelanindrivenroles‬
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaGreat book <br>Hope the film is great too
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaReading the book right now and I didn&#39;t know they based a movie upon it, I can&#39;t wait to see it too
2-_-1nJf8VgdelimeterByIshitaI am reading the book.  Excellent story thus far.  Looks like the cast will bring the story to life.  I can&#39;t wait to see the movie because I will be finished with book by then.  Russell Flowers I agree about Ben Affleck making a perfect Nick Dunne.

nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaКто из Рашки лайк
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshita9 is a magic number though
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaDjango Unchained was awesome, The hateful Eight in my opinion, is like a spin-off sequel but after the civil war. Tarantino&#39;s second western movie could be the best.
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaSure I&#39;d like to see it in 70mm.<br>BUT WHERE!?
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaTook my a couple times to see what Mr. Jackson was sitting on at the beginning.

nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaBe honest. The acting here looks like shit. People are just dickriding it just cuz Samuel L Jackson is in it and it&#39;s a Quentin Tarantino production.
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap, I just had a nerdgasm
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaYou should change the title to &quot;Quentin Tarantino Movie HD&quot; instead
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaAlmost got an orgasm when I saw this in my sub box

nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good. And that was no teaser.
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaLooks AMAZING!!!
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else who thinks that this will be basically a westernized &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; ? But anyways,I&#39;m very excited, can&#39;t wait.
nIOmotayDMYdelimeterByIshitaholy mcshit nuggets

2SupordEUpwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not saying it like you&#39;re a bad person, or anything.  I just was pointing out that I didn&#39;t know, but I _was on the internet_, so I looked it up in 30 seconds.

2SupordEUpwdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is very compelling. Knowing that the director of Incendies helmed this project makes me even more excited.

DBfsgcswlYQdelimeterByIshitaFirst
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitablack skinhead
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite actress in the world!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThe lead actress is Margot Robbie. She is Australian!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible, to me.  
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitadude just stop. you&#39;re embarrassing yourself
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitamcconaughey is looking awesome!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaits pretty fucking obvious bro
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitadamn!! the lead actress(?) looks amazing. what&#39;s her name?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLeo looks like he&#39;s playing... Leo.
It looks like a great film and I&#39;ll be first in line to see it- but don&#39;t expect this to bring Dicaprio Oscar glory.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLeo better win an Oscar for this!

Cant wait for it to come out!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaScorsese is the best director alive.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaKATARINA!!!!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaIf Leonardo doesn&#39;t win for this he never will. He deserved to win for Django Unchained, let alone be nominated
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYES
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThe dark wild side of Jay Gatsby. Haha
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDude, and how about &quot;Hell of a life&quot;?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks a heap different to what I thought it would be. I thought it was gonna be one of those boring business dramas like Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. I&#39;m glad they took the more comical route cos this looks so entertaining. Digging Jonah Hill&#39;s pearly white teeth 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks awesome. By the way, &quot;Black Skinhead&quot; fits perfect for the trailer. Stop hating on an artist based on reputation dumbasses.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshita*throws Oscars at Leo*
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaIt is a Scorsese film, no one gives a shit about Baz Lurhmann so thats probably why...I can only hope this dumbass kayne track isn&#39;t in the final film.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaNo, Jordan Belfort!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaI smell best actor Oscar for Leo and best supporting actor for Jonah Hill and Matthew McConahay (or however you spell it)
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaSo writing/producing/starring in a song means it&#39;s &quot;barely&quot; your song?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitatheir characters are so disguisting, cant wait to watch it
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshita2 Great 2 Gatsby
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaпотрясающееее!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYeezy baby
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitais this the story of Bernie Madoff?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaBased on a true story. Look up the book &#39;Wolf Of Wallstreet&#39;

iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaWow that is not the tone I thought this film would have.. And I love it!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD 1:34
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitamusic and film fits so damn well
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThey were no kanye west songs in the great gatsby they were Jay Z tracks and no church in the wild can barley be considered a kanye song
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitauh ok but what is it about?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaoh how i love leo
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitai can dig it
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping it would have been a more serious film
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaIS THAT GOING TO BE AN COMEDY ?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaAutomatic Oscar nomination.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDirected by Martin Scorsese... that&#39;s all that needed to be advertised. I&#39;m there.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitai smell an oscar...
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaMaybe i am mistaken but what other movie are you referring to ?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitado you hate white guys?
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaAnother one film with Di Caprio + Song of Kanye West.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaholy shit....this is not scorsese
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitasee u at the oscars Marty..
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshita1:33 now that&#39;s awesome.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYay! Another movie about a bunch of white guys who make a lot of money.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDid Leo get his man-card back yet? I think that will be what decides whether or not I watch this.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDamn Leo knows how to pick his movies
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitammm hhmm hmm hmm

hmmm hmmm hmm

mmmh hmmh mhmmh

sssswwwws yea
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshita*Quaaludes.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLeo dicaprio is getting younger than ever! lol
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThat nose is hard to miss.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhoa, do I spy Shane from The Walking Dead?!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaScorsece teams up with DiCaprio. Where the hell is my time machine :O
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaBlack Skinhead.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYEEZUS
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaMark Hanna is the new Les Grossman 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely interesting. But I just can&#39;t imagine this trailer and it&#39;s tone as a Scorsese movie.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitawhat song is this?

iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThought this was going to be another boring wall street movie..looks like a new take on it, can&#39;t wait !
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaUntil Jonah stops being the comic relief, he has not made a successful transition from comedy to drama.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;??
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLooks AMAZING.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaGatsy has bought himself into the future. This should be fun!
Release date, hurry uuup!!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYou can&#39;t watch this trailer only once
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaCRACK? UGH! That&#39;s soooo food coupon! Motherfuckers are doing cocaine, they drive a Countach for fuck&#39;s sake!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThink about if someone walked up to you 5 years ago and said that a movie with Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey that involved midget tossing and throwing lobsters at FBI agents on a yacht would potentially get Leo his first Oscar....
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThose Yeezy screams sound different!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know about DiCaprio but by the looks of the trailer there is a Best Supporting Actor nomination coming to Mr. Matthew McConaughey.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaTop lel
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaSCORSESE ILL GIVE YOU AN OSCAR IF YOU GIVE ME THE REAL YEEZUS I KNOW YOURE READING THESE COMMENTS FUCCBOI NOBODY FUCKED WITH SHUTTER ISLAND GIVE ME YEEZUS
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaYEEZUS JUST ROSE AGAIN
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaKTT WE IN THIS
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitalooks absolutely awesome
Leo is definitely gonna get an Oscar in 2014, FACT!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaJonah Hill&#39;s teeth though
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitahahaha its so funny when theyre humming at the end!!
FUCK YOU SCORSESE LEAK THE FINALIZED MASTER OF YEEZUS
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaFucking epic.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s McConaughey humming while beating his chest at the end? 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaIt would a fucking shame if this guy&#39;d spend his career without winning one Oscar.
He&#39;d already deserved 2 or 3 at least.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaI have never seen Martin Scorcese try to battle-rap and consequently destroy Baz Luhrmann. But this is really, really effing close. Marty just dropped the mic on this bitch
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S YEEZY SEASON KTT FAM
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLeo deserves his long overdue Oscar which he should of won for Gilbert Grape
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaGrabbing at every demographic. I like that. 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaWHY DOES THIS TRAILER HAVE THE SCREAMED VERSION OF BLACK SKINHEADS
FUCK THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE ANSWER MY QUESTION
YEEZY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO US
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaSHANE!!!!!!!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks fucking insane! I can&#39;t wait.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThinking the same thing. Tone completely blew me away. I thought it was going to be a darker film. Maybe there will be a little too much humor me. I dont know, still looking forward to it. 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks promising.  the book is well worth a read
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis. Looks. Outstanding.
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s the trailer song before anyone asks:
Kanye West - Black Skinhead
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLets all hope Leo gets an Oscar!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaFuck yeah!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshita2010&#39;s Casino!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t think the movie was gonna have this kind of tone, but man, this looks ridiculously awesome. November 15th needs to hurry up. Win that Oscar, Leo! 
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaLooks incredible!!!
iszwuX1AK6AdelimeterByIshitaok

RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s playing a dinosaur trainer, of sorts, so those raptors aren&#39;t going to be evil.<br><br>This movie sucks already. The idea of trained dinosaurs takes away from the suspense of the original series.
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaMaking a new dinosaur...hmm I don&#39;t know, well we shall see how it goes I guess.
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaAmazing! Jurassic 
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaThe Ds Are Back Bitcheeeeeeeesss!
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaIs this a remake?
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaIt needs a little more Ooga-Chaka. :) Nah, just kidding, it looks better than I hoped! Can&#39;t wait to see more!!

RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaWas that a Lipleurodon eating the shark?
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaOmg! 😱
RFinNxS5KN4delimeterByIshitaWaited only 13 years for this... and i got what i needed :) Cant wait till summer!

XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitawhy am ai hearing Sam Jackson&#39;s voice in the church scene
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI love Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer&#39;s interactions. They&#39;re my favorite characters in this movie.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaSuch a good movie. Off topic but having rewatched it, I can imagine Skeeter being portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy if it were made today
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaJust finished watching this and might i say... that this movie &quot;DESERVES AN OSCAR&quot; I&#39;m not even joking, I genuinely enjoy this movie I cried,I laughed, theirs a romantic part which is really i eat up<br>And important of all it&#39;s a life lesson just to be considerate to other people and be kind, seriously if you haven&#39;t watched this yet I &quot;HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT &quot; you will not regret it 🤍
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI don’t think it’s a coincidence at all that this is by far Bryce Dallas Howard’s best acting performance.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaWhite people $uck.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaGood thing I watched this movie on my own. I gotta be honest I dropped few tears. Viola Davis, my respect to this lady, what a amazing actress.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThe gwen-verse
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita生理的に相容れない者同士が、相互に軋轢を生まないための合理的な区分けは必要だと思う。<br>日本の東京都には弁護士会が三つあって、弁護士会館をつくるときに第一東京弁護士会だけエレベーターを別につくる要望も根強かったときく。<br>渉外事務所や企業法務系の仕事が多く高収入の人が多いときく第一東京弁護士会。<br>蔵書の違いもあるのか、図書館は東京弁護士会と第二東京弁護士会と別個独立に存在する。<br>目的が不平等な差別か合理的な区別かはよく分からない。ちゃんと調べてないから。<br>トイレも、男女別、多目的用別があるし、スタッフ用トイレ別のところもある。<br>この映画ならではの事情を捨象すると何が問題か分かりにくい。<br>生理的に嫌いならヘルプ不要。<br>自分で家事育児やればいい。<br>自分にとって重要な作業を依頼しておいて、自分より不衛生かのように見下すのは背理に思える。<br>お目当てのコンパニオン指定して飲酒接待させようとしたら、店からヘルプをつけることを押し売りするぼったくりバーも日本にはある。<br>法律事務所でも、指定の弁護士に依頼したらアソシエイトがいっぱいついてきて弁護士報酬が増えることも。<br>会社でも、人事権がないと体裁だけ整えたい人事部が最悪な組み合わせで仕事やらせようとしたり。<br>The という定冠詞の意味は、この映画ではどうだろう。<br>Helpの仕事のロールモデル提示というよりは、Helpの一般的な地位を強調する感じ？<br>多くの証言を集めるところは、「ときめきメモリアル」のメモリーカード事件を思い出させる。<br>制作者の意図を越えて、プレイヤーにパラメータの数値をインチキ設定のメモリーカードを売って稼ぐことに、メーカーの枠を超えて制作者たちが異議を唱えた。<br>それぞれの思い入れを集めて裁判所に証拠提出。<br>あの莫大な量をもってしても、フリーライダーの手抜きに違法評価を与えることはハードル高く賠償金もショボすぎた。<br>バカらしくて二度と生まれたくないと痛感する象徴的事象の一つ。<br>日本国憲法の象徴一族の一挙手一投足をさらけだしてチヤホヤして見本にしたがる人がシンボルとそのHelpに要求する待遇はものすごい特権。<br>でも、象徴一族への従属と協調を力ずくで強制される人にとっては、多重の弾圧でしかない。<br>もはや区分けで済む問題ではない。<br>こんな醜悪な世に生まれない自由がない。<br>生んだ者と生き恥さらすことを強要した者たちが責任とるどころか、徹底的に踏みにじって搾取して恥辱を与え、苦しみまみれの延命をさせてまで絞りとろうとするHelp たちは、さらに重い反作用がかえってきて当然だろう。<br>皇族リケンに群がるただの補助職の看護師とか。
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaA movie which every Karen should see!!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;white guilt&quot; industry is about the most lucrative profession you can aim for a career in.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitagonna check this out
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever🔥
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitafinished this film right now and i dont have any regret that i did watch this fil. it is a brilliant film.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaCurrently having an awesome day as i was told earlier on today by my doctor that i am herpes negative now all thanks to Dr. kwaloe on you tube herbal medication. He&#39;s such a honest man indeed
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaAh ouais lourd
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaIts Weird To See Two Different Gwen Stacy Sharing Scene Together.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI have been rejoicing ever since i got rid of herpes simplex virus with the herbal med i ordered from Dr. kwaloe on you tube, it&#39;s was indeed effective &amp; now i am free from the contagious virus after months of lamenting.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaMary Janes in the Multiverse
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaMy grandma and my brother love this movie so much and it makes them happy forever and always thank you
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best films ever.  Felt so very true. Every actress nailed it.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThis is a chick flick if I&#39;ve ever saw one.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaHola no entendí
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaGlad we’re past this time.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a perfect movie. No really. It is perfect.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita&#39;you are godless woman&#39; is that supposed to mean something? hahahahah
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI cry watching the trailer, BEAUTIFUL STORY BEAUTIFUL FILM
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie you can watch over and over.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaAn amazing film!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita😢😢😢😢😢😢
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s so much to be thankful for right after beating the herpes virus with the help of Dr.ademise on youtube
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI came here from watching the movie on Netflix the other night. It was about to be my senior year of HS when it came out and have ignored it the last ten years until now. It was not easy for me to get into with the ensemble juggling and by an hour and a half i wanted the movie to be over. But at least Stone, Spencer and Davis make a good team. I&#39;ll give them that in spite of the slow pacing.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s amazing how people have such a desire for the same rhetoric of history of Africans portrayed as either slaves or servants and on occasions athletes in movies when history has proven they were inventors, educators, bankers amongst other things back then. Smh.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaSaw it yesterday and love it❤️
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaTo everyone who liked this movie- read the book, it’s just as amazing!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI 💘 LOVE THE HELP
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, as it was special to me, as it reminded me of when we would visit my Grandmother in Colombia, Mississippi (just 80 miles south of Jackson) back in the early 60&#39;s and saw the maids (My Grandmother had one). They were loved, and they loved my Grandmother. She did also raise my Mom, and my Mom loved her, just as Skeeter did!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaMinny don&#39;t burn no chicken
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThis is the book my English class is reading
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaHad to read this book for an English/Reading class in High School. And all I have to say is that I don&#39;t regret choosing this book! Amazing story and very inspiring!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaSalut les loulou
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaBRYCE!!!!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOTkNsxhECY&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> sounds exactly like Samuel L Jackson
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI wish they had made the bad woman blonde.  Red-hair is too often demonised in society, despite the fact it often denotes Celtic or Jewish ancestry.  Blonde hair, however, is generally the sign of Aryan privilege (yes, I know a few ethnic people dye their hair, but natural/natural-looking blonde hair tends to denote WASP/Northern European privilege).  <br><br>Also, they should have made the bad woman more of a bimbo, instead of making the nice, working-class woman a bimbo.  Intellectual stupidity and ignorance should always be frowned upon.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this film and I cried my eyes out! Even though there are not Latinx characters in it, I feel like there is so much we have in common. <br>🤍🙏🏼 <br>And with this I’m going to say that there are still innocent children in cages separated from their parents as a mother, my heart aches for both. <br>I wish for a world with more compassion, kindness, and love no matter our race, ethnicity, or color of skin. 🙏🏼🤍
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThe pie scene was the best scene in the movie, what a way for Minnie to relate to Hilly for firing her for using the bathroom. Hilly deserved that punishment 100%, I hate Hilly so much. She should be put into jail for what she’s done to the whole town
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI <b>love</b> Miss Hilly&#39;s scream!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI am reading the book right now and watching the trailer just makes me exited for the movie!! GAAHH
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaSuch an EXCELLENT movie
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie had me laughing and then in tears
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaWhite people were really disgusting and actually the worse I can think of.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaBryce Dallas Howard deserved a nomination for this.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaLol 2 Gwen stacys
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaMdrrrr 2020 au confinement j&#39;aime et commentaire 😅
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaNUUUUL
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaYo I am crying after watching this 😢
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaOur topic for today In college  Philippines, my class report.  What an amazing story.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitathe book is sooooo good so i’m gonna watch this right now
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t stop laughing..<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOTkNsxhECY&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a>
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie now features a record number of actresses having the Academy Award in history: Viola Davis &quot;Fences&quot;/ Octavia Spencer &quot;The Help&quot;/ Emma Stone &quot;La La Land&quot;/ Allison Janney &quot;I, Tonya&quot;/<br><br>Cicely Tyson (Lifetime Achievement) /Sissy Spacek &quot;Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter&quot;/ Mary Steenburgen &quot;Howard &amp; Melvin&quot;
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie so much. I&#39;m confused about one thing though. Aibileen makes $182 a month and Skeeter makes $32 a month at the Jackson journal. How is that possible? Can anyone explain please.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOTkNsxhECY&amp;t=2m06s">2:06</a> Gwen Stacy vs Gwen Stacy
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaEn esta pelicula se basaron para un baile de dance moms
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaOmg how good was Octavia In this movie? And viola? Love those two, there are still a few good movies left in Hollywood and this is one of them
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie makes me boo hoo every time
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaThe music for this is waaaay too cheery (it sounds like music for a romcom trailer, the film is far too serious to be classed as &quot;feelgood&quot;), but the film is pretty great 😊
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaGood ass movie
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching this movie. And I can&#39;t stop crying
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaEvery movie with Viola davis in it is a masterpiece
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaFor those who have read the book, i wish we could&#39;ve seen Skeeter embrace her &quot;hippie&quot; fashion.
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshita<b>BEST.</b> <b>MOVIE.</b> <b>EVER.</b>
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaBest movie...EVER!

XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitajust the trailer made me emotional cant wait to watch the movie
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaYou can delete your youtube account.. that&#39;ll do it!!!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaHow did I get here from Pony videos??
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaGREAT MOVIE!! Emma Stone is awesome!! I love Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer in this!
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitawow first trailer that i&#39;ve seen that does not look like a trailer but still looks like a movie :p
XOTkNsxhECYdelimeterByIshitaFirst .. hhh 

it&#39;s look like really good to me .. 
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it could be real good.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis freakin guy Ryan screaming in terror had me chuckling. I want to see more!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaVote For Donald
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing. God I hope they didnt spoil all the good bits
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitawhats the song in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQR5zsLHbYw&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a>?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m dying too rip that ugly mustache off of Ryan&#39;s face.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQR5zsLHbYw&amp;t=0m34s">0:34</a> - Fightin&#39; Around The World With Russell Crowe!! X-D
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaRyan Gosling&#39;s chicken shit scream will never not be funny and nobody kicks anus like fat Russel Crowe. And there&#39;s even a giant fuckin fly in it? Shut up and take my pesos!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitathis is just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang XD but better
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLooks great but a also a carbon copy of kiss kiss bang bang
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita...  Run.  <br><br>I laughed for hours.  I&#39;m still chuckling.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaA role where Russell Crowe hits people for a living? He was born for this role.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLooks Good. Crowe doing comedy might work.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis is a movie that would be so much better with Nicolas Cage as the main :)
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaonly watching cos of ryan
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI am reaching but I fall, and the stars are black and cold, as I stare into the void, of a world that cannot hold. I&#39;ll escape now from that world; from the world of Jean Valjean. There is nowhere I can turn. There is no way to go on
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita...this movie looks better than the last 5 similar movies I&#39;ve seen come out in ages.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Since the funeral.&quot;
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitawhere is jack kilmer?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitalooks like a way better inherent vice
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitahonestly, i havent watched a film trailer in years that had me feelin like this one, and tbh i havent watched a good (new) film in a very long time<br>im look forward to this
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaShane Black?<br><br>edit: yup...awesome can&#39;t wait!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks so fucking retarded! I understand that both these men lack as much in comedic talent as they do in acting chops, but did they have to make the comedy seem so forced? This is going to stink up the box office big time. Dumb shit
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaSo far all the trailers look good I am so ready for this. Hopefully it will turn out as great as it looks.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaRussell Crowe is kinda looking like John Goodman in &quot;Raising Arizona.&quot;
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitait looks fun and wrong. Ha.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI click like the first 2 minutes im convinced  to be in tears of laughter besides where else can you through a dead body at a reception
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThats funny with the lady on her hubby been missing. He is dead lol
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThe song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQR5zsLHbYw&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> and Ryan Gosling combination means Remember the Titans
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis will be the best movie of the year <br>Neo-noir comedy...I love it
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitathis looks like what inherent vice wanted to be. this looks good as hell
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaNice guys finish last, that&#39;s why I&#39;ll treat you like trash...
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitawas that... the mothman in the backseat?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaShane Black is a genius, and I think this cast is awesome. I can&#39;t wait to see this film.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks funny as hell.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaShane Black doing what he does best. I&#39;m in.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaSong name from 1.04 onwards?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks hilarious. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was a amazing movie, and this seems to be the same style,humor,with increased violence. Buying this with a giant smile on my face.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaanother 80s movie  yeah
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitahopefully &quot;Long Cool Woman&quot; is in the movie.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaFANF THE MOVIE
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking great!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaryan, russell, a bit of guns, a bit of funny... i like.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita🙇🙆
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThats a brilliant idea to dump a corpse on a neighboring wedding  reception hahaha
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaRyan Gosling not in type cast lol must see
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitalooks great
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaOh Shane Black.. xD
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song at the beginning?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Inherent Vice but better
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQR5zsLHbYw&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a> wait wat?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks pretty damn good!!!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshita😂😂
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaEvery trailer I see for this movie has me laughing my ass off. I also like how the first trailer had most of the focus on Russel Crowe making him seem like the protagonist and Ryan Gosling was the sidekick, and this trailer does the reverse. Now I don&#39;t know who the focus is going to be on in the full movie, or maybe they&#39;ll both get equal focus.<br><br>Either way, the fact that the same movie can have two different trailers with two different focuses makes me hopeful for the movie itself.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a really good funny movie ! 😂😂 had me laughing
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThe first one was cool...this one made me laugh. I&#39;m in.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaHahahahahahaha! That last joke! I live for that shit!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitahaha this looks amazing
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI love everything about that &quot;easy way&quot; scene. Many shades of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Weird to see two uber intense actors doing comedy, even if Gosling does dabble (he was perfect in The Big Short).
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaWelp there goes every bit of shock comedy from the movie.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI have been doing a little research project this month. I have had extra time as compared to a normal human being who works. And so to kill time, I have been going to a lot of movies. I have been going to an inordinate amount of movies, more movies than an average human being. Naturally, the first thing I did was watch the movies I really wanted to see based on the previews that I had witnessed. I saw Deadpool which I thought was amazing, then I went to see Zootopia, which was the best movie of the year so far. But, then I started watching movies I wouldn&#39;t normally go see. I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane, which was just ok, and then I saw Risen, which I had mistaken for a movie about Roman soldiers. I was right but also very wrong and the movie wasn&#39;t that good anyways. I also saw a movie with one of my favorite actors, George Clooney, however that movie ended up being HIS worst. Then I got really bored and went to see movies I didn&#39;t even want to see.   I went to see The Witch, which was bad, and finally dragged myself into the atrocity of a film The Divergent Series: Allegiant, which made me surprised, because I hadn&#39;t killed myself before its credits.<br><br>My science experiment was that I made a mental note of the feeling the picture gave me just from the previews. The experiment proved that the preview is a very good indicator on whether a movie is going to be good or bad.  I raved about the preview for Deadpool and Zootopia which turned out to be fantastic, and turned my nose up for The Divergent Series: Allegiant which turned out to be a disaster. I had a similar spectrum of feelings for all the movies in the middle. I did not go see The Gods of Egypt. That movie preview was so bad, I decided that I would rather sit in a dark room and listen to grass grow. As it turns out the people who made that film are either fired, broke or both. Maybe they should pick up my hobby.<br><br>My point is that The Nice Guys  has got my attention. The preview has made me get the inkling that I am really going to enjoy it. Is it the aging Crowe or the young rising Gosling? Maybe it is the setting or the plot, or a combination of the two? I don&#39;t know why I am going to enjoy The Nice Guys, but I would be willing to put money down that I will love it.  I think that a lot of people will agree with me that WB has got this trailer right, and so the movie must be right as well. <br><br>I have never seen so many movies in a short amount of time. I pity you people over in Hollywood. I once thought there was great glamour in the movie business. However the reality of it is that there is a lot of junk to sift through. I am happy that the previews allows us to avoid movies that aren&#39;t worth a 2D matinee. I also want to thank the industry for making that fact blatantly obvious. <br><br>We will see how my nose fairs for the next month. So far I have smelled a stinky ghost, shook my head at a mothers day movie that smells like an old &quot;friends&quot; sock, and wondered why Tommy Lee Jones is suddenly mute.<br><br>Time will tell Youtube... Time will tell...
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaWas that Matt Bomer?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it so damn funny when grown men run away from something like children afraid of getting a timeout?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaMovie of the fucking year right here. holy shit lol.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitadamn crowe looking old as fuck
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaIt seems like a great companion film to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Looks awesome!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitathis looks fucking hilarious.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI know what happens at the end. SPOILER ALERT WARNING <br><br>RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSEL CROWE DIE....... i think?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaAnother L for Warner Bros.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis feels like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Which is an EXCELLENT thing.  I already know I will love this movie. I&#39;m sold. You sold me.  Make many many more movies like this please and thank you.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaNow here&#39;s the kicker: They have a super cool CGI dog named &quot;Sparky&quot; he&#39;s always cracking jokes and the movie is directed by Micheal Bay!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThis look not so bad, probably gonna give it a watch :) at least its not a remake or a sequel just like a lot of the movies who are coming out this summer
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLOL Zodiac (2007) Music!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaThe Nice Guys - Main Trailer *tips fedora
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaMakes me nostalgic for the &#39;90s when we watched &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; about the &#39;70s and were nostalgic for that earlier time of drugs, sex, and murder. Man, &#39;90s movies about the &#39;70s were great.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaLooks nice
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitathey showed us the whole movie!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the names of the two songs?
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to watch this
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaRyan Goslings terrified and Russell Crowe planning a beatdown for a little girl. I&#39;m sold!
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this movie. the last non big budget movie I saw in theaters because the trailers were pretty good was Seven Psychopaths and that was a really good movie. this reminds me of that and I&#39;m hyped for it.
GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait it look great

GQR5zsLHbYwdelimeterByIshitaCa a l&#39;air vachement cool ce film !
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite horror movie.<br><br>It has everything: monsters, cult, gore, tension and it&#39;s clearly influenced by Lovecraft. You can never go wrong making a Lovecraftian horror movie.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitascary looking trailer but the actual movie is shit. its way too random and fast paced and the actings pretty bad. stopped watching after 30 minutes
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitajust stop trying to make a commercial (high or low budget) lovecraft film. it seems to be impossible.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaits a good movie
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaBut Psycho Goreman!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaPoor janitor so much cleaning
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best horror movies I’ve seen
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis garbage tested my patience.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThe Thing
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaFor someone who haven’t read Lovecraft, is this still enjoyable? It is truly SCARY?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the void?

IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is very underrated. I want more of this.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThe creepy voices and music over trailers are there to make most horrors look scarier than they actually are. I guess you lot never knew that. 😂😂😂
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWas a really good flick!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitathe worst movie I watched in 2020
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWhy the fuck are people so blind to the greatness that is this movie? How the FUCKKKKKK does it only score a 5.8 on IMDB?? Please tell me how? I haven’t found one single movie that tops it. People are so dumb.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWHAT A SHIT FUCKIN MOVIE!! WORST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN YEARS! Dont bother watching it unless you wanna be disappointed.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaA gem
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIts a movie that came out of no where. In a sea of horror movies that are generally sub par trash, this is a fucking hidden gem. Do you like Lovecraft? Do you like cosmic horror? You will enjoy this movie. Yes, our lord and savior Cthulhu does make an appearance, but not exactly how one would expect. The sheer scale and way they did it makes the hair on my neck stand on end. So good. <br>Ignore the Zeratul introduction. This is Lovecraft cosmic horror at its best, at least in the last decade, couple of decades?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite movies. Definitely worth a watch
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaCould be a nice Horror Shooter game
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaNothing is scarrier than the x-files
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaExcellent 80’s horror homage - really worth a watch if you enjoy the genre.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitawho are these living piles of flesh?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis has somehow a resemblance to &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. Love it!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSounds like Zeratul is doing the narrations 😂
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaOnly thing I didn&#39;t like was the cult members. I thought they were kind of goofy, not scary at all. The monsters in the basement on the other hand....
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIlluminati Has Gone Too Far.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkmSNt4moNg&amp;t=0m58s">0:58</a> Impending doom approaches<br><br>Moon lord is awoken!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshita:O :O
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaloved it lol creepy shit
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitawow...
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI watched this hoping for late night b movie entertainment to veg out to. Instead ended up staying up as I became invested into the movie rather quickly and had a nice little tale to tell with a good twist.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Why don&#39;t we make that diary entry from Event Horizon into a film?&quot;<br>&quot;Take my funding&quot;

IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaNot really sure what&#39;s making horror movie so damn good lately...<br>But I&#39;m definitely loving it!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaExcited for this one after seeing the trailer
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea about the actual movie but I can say that this is one of the best trailers for a horror movie that I have ever seen!!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t I  stop masturbating to this?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaya....i want to see this
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never been so scared of a triangle.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitathe narrator sounds like a protoss arbiter
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIs this intentionally Lovecraftian?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t handle body horrors :&#39;( (will watch anyway)
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaGreat idea, reminds me of The Thing. Like other recent horror fare though it&#39;s probably going to be terribly executed with a predictable plot twist like Daniel is the son of whatever evil entity is calling the cult and/or the murderous family at the beginning is trying to stop the bad guys.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaBack in March 2015, BIO-COP sent me DM about this next feature film, The Void, so I suspected he&#39;d make an appearance. <br>Is that him at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkmSNt4moNg&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a>?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThank you Stranger Things, for inspriring horrors like this. It&#39;s like getting to see the cinematic versions of good Stephen King horror novels. This will be amazing.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaBill Cipher is behind this.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSan loss. Tentacles. Nightmarish descent into madness. <br><br>H.P Lovecraft approves.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaDAAAAAAAMN DANIE, U GOT FUCKING STABBED BRO
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitamust watch this!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThought this was protoss related. My mistake.<br>I&#39;ll be leaving now.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaZeratul really went downhill it seems
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaPhilip DeFranco sent me here
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking idiotic.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaLoving the good horror movies trend, because this one looks amazing.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaFEAR THE OLD BLOOD
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaNow this is some good shit right here boy
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitanothing like watching a horror movie trailer before bed.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaEver watching something that doesn&#39;t seem so scary but you start to tear up at. Me at the beginning of the trailer and now I&#39;m done. When a trailer does that I stop and wait til it comes out.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSaw this at Toronto After Dark. Great fun!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaDaaaaaaaaamn Daniel
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSomeone call Delta Green, SCP, MIB, IDGAF JUST GET SOMEONE ON THIS!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like the hospital levels from Silent Hill
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaooh i love a good lovecraft inspired movie
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitawas that josh from the blair witch that first came in on the sretcher
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaOh this looks cool!  I&#39;m going to go see it when it hits theaters!  Maybe finally I can get my brother to go to a horror movie.  <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not horror, it&#39;s Cult Thriller!&quot;  Hehehe.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitajust here to leave all my nopes.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIlluminati confirmed- THE MOVIE
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis honestly looks interesting.  Love H.P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith, as well as a large number of other horror writers.  This definitely has a bit of a Clive Barker feel.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWhen gravity falls and earth becomes sky, fear the beast with just one eye
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSilent Hill and The Strangers mixed together! Also! is that one of the meth tweekers from Letterkenny at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkmSNt4moNg&amp;t=0m27s">0:27</a>? DECENT!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitanice another movie that i wont  watch because i dont want to cry when the lights are out :/
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaPhilly D brought me here
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaIs this Beverly Hills Cop IV ?<br>Am I doing it right guys??<br>That&#39;s how I make &quot;dank meme&quot; comments???
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSo sick and hp lovecraft influences!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkmSNt4moNg&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a> KNIVES CHAU!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like this will do Cosmic Horror justice. Haven&#39;t seen a good cosmic horror film since Into The Mouth Of Madness and Event Horizon.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like some good&#39;ol Lovecraftian horror!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaHEY that&#39;s the chick from Patriot! (?)
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaWhen I see matching outfits I think of the Django Unchained scene
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not really a fan of horror(as a kid/teenager yeah, not so much as an adult) but this looks pretty damn good.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Executive producer of a movie in which he had no contributing role&quot;<br>They&#39;re really reaching, aren&#39;t they?<br><br>That said, this looks fun and I hope it&#39;s a huge success.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSick!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitawhat the f*** is this? actually looks pretty horrifying.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaSilent Hill Films still get made?
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThe Thing returns
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaPRAISE THE GOOD BLOOD
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaGravity Falls Live Action sure looks AWESOME!  :D
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaAmazing! love the look! reminds me of Carpenter&#39;s work.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuuuuuuuuck
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaFucking YEAH!!!!!!!!!!
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI see a little &quot;Stranger Things&quot; font choices going on in there.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaNot my kinda thing.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaAh... Cthulhu is involved somehow, I know it
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m imagining those robed killers outside meeting to discuss the matching costume design they want, how they&#39;re going to make the costumes (maybe they had to go to a shop and hire someone), and distributing them to everyone. It really softens the horror when you imagine all the boring mundane things that had to go into it.
IkmSNt4moNgdelimeterByIshitaThis is fucked up
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwh9c_E3dJk&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> ... really?

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitamiles teller? no thanks...
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaI hope this turns out good, if not great. Miles Teller needs it after that shit stain &quot;Fantastic Four.&quot; He&#39;s a promising young actor.

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaMiles Teller is going to own it in this movie and I am going to see this movie more than Once in the Cinemas. It reminds me of Lord of War and I love that its based on a true story.

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshita´Murican propaganda.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaA must see, my type of movie ayyyy!
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a Michael Bay &quot;comedy&quot; like Pain and Gain.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaThe Wolf of wall street + Lord of war=War dogs
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitasong?
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaWill Jonah hill ever be not fat.

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaThe director of hangover making a semi-serious movie about somebody&#39;s true story...And this is what it looks like?<br>This looks great and i cant wait lol
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought it Said watch dogs
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaJonah Hill is fat again? I just can&#39;t keep up with him anymore...
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaStop trying to recreate Wolf of Wall Street😑
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaLol how do people not know what this movies about there&#39;s a synopsis of it right the description.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YEAAAA A FAT JONAH HILLLLLLLLL
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaI already hate the characters.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaFat Jonah hill is back
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song in the trailer
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaIf they say it&#39;s based on a true story, people will fact check this movie. However, I&#39;m still interested.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaThey have Jonah Hill, which is good. But they have Miles Teller, the guy who played Reed Richards in the Fantastic Four movie, which is pretty bad if he&#39;s going to do another wooden performance in this movie.<br><br>Purely 50/50 on this movie being good or bad based solely on Teller&#39;s performance to lead and Hill to be good comedic support. Otherwise I doubt Jonah can carry this movie himself.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitafunny version of Lord of war
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaCocaine? My kind of movie.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaNot my tempo, but i will still watch !

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaI get that it&#39;s a teaser and all but, never before have I seen a trailer that left me with absolutely no fucking clue what the hell the movie is supposed to be about.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitajust when i thought it was Jonah HILL, it turned to Jonah MOUNTAIN
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitawarne bros sucks when it comes to marketing...
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitalooks Ok
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaHow the fuck did jonah hill get even fatter!?

Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaayy lmao
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitawhen One stare from Bradley Cooper is best thing in whole trailer
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaMiles Teller is underrated. He needs a good movie though
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaI actually went to audition to be an extra in this. I didn&#39;t get called back.
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitalook&#39;s good
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaI hate it when people reply &quot;ikr&quot; and &quot;same&quot;
Rwh9c_E3dJkdelimeterByIshitaoh... so Jonah Hill got fat again

iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaCan Hollywood please start making movies as good as this again! For the love of God!!!!!!
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaevlaaat :D Içerde &lt;3
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThe flaw in this film is how Costello didn’t work out dicaprio was the eat  great movie though
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThere is a really good similar Turkish tv series called Icerde
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitajust copy chinese movie, can&#39;t compare with the original one
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaShould not of won best picture
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaProbably the greatest cast assembled in a while.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThroughout the movie they are X&#39;s for the characters.  &quot;Their is no pain you are receding...
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t rave enough about this movie and the excellent cast. Scorsese at his best.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s great movie
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaNever seen it
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna be honest, I like this film way more than <i>Infernal Affairs</i> (the Hong Kong film that inspired this film).
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitabest cast I have seen in a movie!
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitais it a remake of chinese movies called &quot;Infernal Affairs ?&quot;, it was 2002 and the departed is 2004..
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitait&#39;s crazy how people call this the greatest movie and yet they just copied everything from a 2002 Chinese movie called internal affairs. Watch internal affairs the original movie ,then you will understand the authenticity of the movie . It&#39;s way better than departed.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaAs scorcese movies go this was a disappointment especially with that cast
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThis is one of the greatest movies of all time
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThis version of Comfortably Numb is better. Just my opinion.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitathis movie is so good, I&#39;m big fan of Damon, but in the end I really start to hate him.. great work.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaI saw the Chinese movie first, I think that movie is much better than this.. just an opinion
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaOnly guy missing is Liam Neeson
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest cast in the history of cinema.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshita11 years ago &quot;The Departed&quot; was released. What a great movie,great story,LEGENDARY actors.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaMark Walberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon<br><br>The holy trinity
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaIçerde
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThis is the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen. <br><br>10/10
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitagreat movie............... ending was stupid

iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaİçerdema
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaRacism at its peak. You got the same perfect movie performed by Asians and no body cares, but remake the same movie with white cast they give you an Oscar :(

iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitathis movie was great
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaBest Gangster Movie Ever.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaBut Master French is my best :)
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaTarrantino will always be the overall master of soundtracks by a landslide, but this movie has the greatest soundtrack of any single movie ever.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaOne of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhy does every scorcese need racism it ruins the whole movie
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaSo....we have Arrival, and then we have The Departed.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThey are just gonna redo &quot;Infernal affairs&quot; and get this much credit for? i hope Scorsese gives credit to Andrew Lau
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaScorsese is the best
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitalol, wheres leo? &quot;leo he was never even in the movie&quot;   &quot;muahahahhahaha&quot;  &quot;told ja we could&quot;<br><br>ROTFlmfao
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitamaybe go fuck your self
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitado yourself a favor and do not watch a trailer like this before the movie
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaIçerdeden gelenler😂
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThe whole cast look alike
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaİçerde beyler :D
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaiçerdeyim😎
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaBest crime movie ever
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhats the song at the beginning?
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaThe movie was far far better then the trailer! It was just a breathtaking movie! The trailer could be better.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitabest crime movies ever <br><br>the departed <br>training day <br>street kings <br>brooklyn finest
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaiçerde ;D
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitacaldik kardes helal edin :D
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaiçerde misin
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshita10 years later and this movie is still awesome
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaworst movie ever
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaX marks the spot
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhaa Leo looks so young here compared to in blood diamond which came out same year..
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitathe departed- a fractured hand gets beaten by a shoe<br>casino- a hand gets hammered down<br>taxi driver- a hand is completely blown off<br>the fuck is up with scorses and hands
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaMark Wahlberg and Matt Damon shouldn&#39;t be cast in the same movie. They look too similar. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn&#39;t look too dissimilar to them either.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshita&quot;My name is Singh, motherfucker&quot;<br><b>Fight goes down in the store</b><br>&quot;What the fuck is wrong with this country?! Everybody hates everybody!!&quot;
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaLeonardo DiCaprio did a fantastic job playing this role but in my opinion he got a little over performed by Jack Nicholson who was just OUTSTANDING in this movie! The most well-played movie villian EVER!
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitaLeonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg reunited 11 years after &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; when they played teenager kids and in this movie they both have become grown up men😊
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhy they don&#39;t make movies like this 😒
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitathis is perhaps the best cast a movie ever got.
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhy on the end of the movie all of them died?? that was kind of stupid no???
iojhqm0JTW4delimeterByIshitawhy on the end of the movie all of them died?? that was kind of stupid no???

WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitamzabivru dshd sghgrsdvfbmvyq🔧🗼 kctc bbxcgz
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaHorrible, absolutely horrible directing and acting. You can see it in the trailers. The person who did a film like this right is the director who directed &#39;The Devils Double&#39;. Both the actor and director should hv won Oscars
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaIs this movie ever coming out in America?
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaThis Shit Looks FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitais that the 9th doctor playing as a detective?
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaafter jack and Jill, I can&#39;t see a movie with one actor as both of the main characters
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this film! and yes- I would f@ck the gay brother :)
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaJust waiting for Tom Hardy to be the next 007.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaWhat is the trailer song?
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the eyeglasses that Ronnie wears??? Pls response!!!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshita&quot; The Last of the Famous Playboys &quot;   Here is the story of two gangsters that Morrissey created a song,  back in 1989. I&#39;m not fond of them using the same actor as twins, but I guess it works.<br><br>  &quot;In our lifetime those who kill , The newsworld hands them stardom &quot;
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the Devil guy with the big ass horns??
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaFantastic!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s better than Tom Hardy? <br>two Tom Hardys
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaThat shit Kray.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaOf all the upcoming films lately, this is the one I seriously cannot wait for!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaUm this isn&#39;t legend
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshita<b>cough</b> Tatiana Maslany <b>cough</b>
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaSo Sick!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitawhere are the bitches?!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the name of the song? PLEASE!!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitawhat is the song in background ?????????
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaI swear that the scene at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVHlrfzLjd4&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> wasn&#39;t in the film?

WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaWho saw the kid from Kingsman ?
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaI love Tom Hardy
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaOk this looks pretty good.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaEuropean criminality is highly glorified in Hollywood for some reason. Murder, assault, racketeering, drug smuggling and wanton acts of violence all with no stereotypical ramifications that cripple the image of said demographic. God damn! must be nice.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t this movie called Kray Kray? Get it? 😂
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy is a prick. This looks retarded.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaSong is I&#39;m so sorry imagine dragons
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaAnybody know the name of the song they use? Catchy as anything.

WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching it
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitai liked the look of the teaser but not this like the krays did not act like this Ronnie didn&#39;t tell people he liked boys and Reg wasn&#39;t like this either was really hoping they would be more realistic
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy is the fuckin&#39; man!!! I can&#39;t wait to see this.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaRemake of &quot;The Krays&quot;. Excellent british movie. The fact that Hardy is playing both of them makes it more interesting. Legend? OK Title.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaOH MY GODNESS, the level of magnificent this looks it&#39;s un-freakin-believable. Totally gonna be watchin&#39; this. &gt; u &lt;

WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaMissed a golden opportunity to call this movie Kray Kray.
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitathis looks absolutely amazing and has two of my favorite actors in it. I can&#39;t wait
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaStarring Tom Hardy and Tom Hardy... this is going to be awesome, the more Bane the better!
WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaBrothers. Gangsters. Icons. Tom Hardy is Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Watch the LEGEND trailer now!

WVHlrfzLjd4delimeterByIshitaFrist
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaok it&#39;s shows lots of promise. I&#39;m really digging the theme, the music, the animation and stuff. but why you have to switch their bodies? that part imho could have been sketched and done something else with it. a girl in a boys body and a boy in a girls body is a little uncomfortable. I would have been ok if it was physical body shift, but this trailer gives me the impression it&#39;s a mind shift.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaIt will be also in Italy?<br>Sorry for my english 😅

xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaA masterpiece!
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitai wish my life looked as pretty and vibrant as this film instead i live in this boring snowy city like literally all u see is white and everything is soggy

xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaSo I&#39;m a person who doesn&#39;t cry at.... things in general..... <br><br>This made me break down in tears. In the middle of a crowded air plane. I&#39;m not proud of myself. It was not okay. This movie is beautiful and utterly, completely, unforgivably despicable.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitashinkai ingenious

xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitatoo romantic, this is what makes my expectations for romance so high T_T <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%234everalone">#4everalone</a>
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshita&quot;In your eyes&quot; anime version
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaThe best innovations always come from Japan, may it be technology or entertainment. <br>P.S - I&#39;m not Japanese.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitawhats the song in the trailer?
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaIf you love this movie just like me, Click👍<br>From high school boy in <br>Tokyo 🇯🇵
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so stupid. Because I was frantically looking for the anime not even bothering watching the whole trailer so I watched the trailer again and it says its realeses on November 24 and today is still 22 so that means the anime is aired on Thursday!!
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaAnyone knows if this movie will be on cinema in America?
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaseems so interesting
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaseems interesting saw it in london&#39;s underground station adverts
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaThis Trailer gets my heart pumping. I really really want to watch this
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaJust sun this reviewed on the BBC of all places. I thought they ignored anime.<br><br>Dispute the well-worn premise, it looks like being a good one.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaNO MORE ENGLISH DUB PLEASE
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaI think I have already seen this one. Wasn&#39;t it called &quot;5 Cm per Second&quot;? ... Ah, no! It was &quot;Voices from a distant star!&quot;
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaJust watched in Bangkok. Fully booked tickets even at 10AM times. It&#39;s fresh. Hollywood can never think of.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this movie ❤
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaThis is kimi no na wa right???
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaSheffield anyone?
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaI am not an anime nerd or expert<br>However as a movie,<br>This movie is great

xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaWhat if they google themselves?

xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaWake up as a girl<br>Get girl&#39;s cell<br>Call my cell<br>Explain situation to myself over the phone<br>Surprised that she is also in the same situation but in my body<br>Meet up at location. <br>Go from there.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitathe whole &quot;switching&quot; lives/bodies thing is so overrated and has been done way too many times. it seems like an interesting movie. I might wanna see this.
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaMe going into this movie: looks pretty but kind of cheesy! surprised this is the new spirited away and an oscar contender apparently Me after watching this movie: MY MIND HAS BEEN FUCKED AND IM NOT SURE IF I CAN EVER RECOVER I LOVE THIS MOVIE GIVE IT AN OSCAR GIVE IT ALL THE OSCARS AND ALL DA MONIES
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaOmg it looks so good it sucks that i won&#39;t be able to watch it tho bc i love in the us rip me
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitaI cried
xU47nhruN-QdelimeterByIshitalol I thought she said &quot;let me meet a handsome city boy!&quot;<br>good to know, its &quot;Make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!&quot;

tmeOjFno6DodelimeterByIshita<b>Explodes from Hype</b>
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaNot very popular, but that doesn&#39;t dimish Deniro&#39;s performance. Brilliant as usual. Love this guy ! When you&#39;re talented, you&#39;re talented.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJit_DU2XhM&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> <i>You are on </i><b><i>Kimmel,</i></b><i> you&#39;re on </i><b><i>Fallon...</i></b>  Oh, come on! Let&#39;s up the bar a bit.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaall those saying this is bad : STFU <br>Hella underrated !
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaRobert DeNiro is a lousy comic actor and even worse comedian.  Why do actors think they can do standup?
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaOld men with younger women. What&#39;s new in show biz?
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThe Comedian movie is good with Robert Deniro, Danny Devito, Patti LuPone(she was Jennifer Lopez mother in Parker movie with Jason Statham.), Harvey Keitel. Robert Deniro is funny LOL.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitathis trailer saved me an hour and a half
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThis is a great movie. Totally underrated though... Go and watch it!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshita😛
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitagood lord is this a piece of shit
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was awesome. Funny!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaLooks f..ng good :)))
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaLooks f..ng good :)))
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThe Comedian Trailer
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaNice comedy show in the film format :-)
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie. Great storytelling and acting by everyone involved. Funny, grumpy and moody at the same time. About real human beings trying to get by. Hugely underrated!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitagreat movie, underrated
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaI love Mr. DiNiro
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaHow a legend became trash, so sad.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaHorrible waste of time and money. &quot;The Comedian&quot; is ripe with classless, senseless potty humor and a disjointed confusing storyline. DeNiro is the worst. He delivers his lines like he&#39;s literally reading them off a page for the first time. He brings the whole movie to a grinding, nail-on-the-chalkboard, nasty experience. DeNiro has gone to DeZero perhaps for good. He&#39;s a washed up has-been liberal moron.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaI mean, it does have Robert De Niro with a goatee... So there&#39;s that...
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaLooks predictable, but has a cool cast.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThe casting looks really good, but oh my goodness. This looks awful... :/
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, this looks awful. Its just one of those movies that follow the age old rules of storytelling. Lonely man with crushed dreams, seeks out old relatives, gets new friends, old dreams start to blossom, the new friend becomes his girlfriend. Wow! Where is Stanley Kubrick, where is Scorsese? Enough of this no-talent, hacky, storytelling clichés. Make art! Not money!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaThis definitely looks like it is worth watching.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m seeing this just for DeVito.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitawow, so much talent wasted.  It&#39;s weird because what should be the best thing about this is the worst thing.  Robert DeNiro is miscast
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaLouie in 20 years.
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitalooks fun!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaPeople are gonna go thinking it&#39;s a marvel novie
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaSo when  does he start killing, burning and cracking jokes? also seems to have got rid of his mask and smiley badge :(
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaAhh i love Danny DeNiro, I think he&#39;s a great actor!!
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitadanny devito does like de niro&#39;s brother
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitacringe-worthy. what are you doing Bob!?
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! :) When the film will be released in the CIS countries?
QJit_DU2XhMdelimeterByIshitafirst to like, MASTERPIECE, De Niro for Oscar!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathis looks absolutely fantastic.  first time in awhile im excited to go to the movies (last time being The Revenant). im so sick of the superhero oversaturation, along with remakes, sequels, reboots, etc. id rather take a beating than watch another stupid pointless remake or sequel.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaSaw it today..opening matinee in San Francisco. Liked it a lot. Very perfomance driven, and Everyone is great, including the small parts. So, has that Coen brothers high quality thing...lots of space, Texas, 1980&#39;s feel. But Everyone is great in it. Great director too.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI was looking forward to seeing this movie this weekend but no theater even remotely close to me is playing it.  :(
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathe Dude abides ....
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the best movie I&#39;ve seen in quite some time. Amazing acting, humor, action, plot, and 98% realistic. I hope this gets the attention it deserves.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThe Sheriff in my hometown of Waco, Texas was the inspiration for Jeff Bridges&#39; character.  We are all very proud of Sheriff Parnell McNamara and is his family&#39;s multi-generation involvement in law-enforcement in Texas!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is at a perfect 100% on rotten tomatoes
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaAnyone notice that when they go to rob the first bank that the doors are secured with a chain and pad lock. Not very realistic for a bank that is open with customers in it.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDamn this looks good. WesternNoir.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaYou had me at &quot;Academy award winner Jeff Bridges&quot;
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a Ben Foster role I didn&#39;t like. From Spacker Dave to Warren Worthington III to Pandorum...can he just be in every other movie that comes out?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathe dude who plays albert parker is why i&#39;m gonna see this!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitawhat version of the song is this?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks bad ass!!!!!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaBen Foster packing on the pounds.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaFrom the writer of Sicario<br>Me: Yep, I&#39;m sold 😀
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitano country for true grit.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDamn good way to live.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI got so pumped up after I saw this trailer. Then lost my mind when I noticed its coming out this month. Yes!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaOMG Midland I live in Midland
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathe generic gun cocking at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=0m34s">0:34</a> lol
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaJust saw the movie in an advanced screening at my theater. Just as a warning know that the the story is somewhat slow. Yet the ending is somewhat emotional seeing how much the brothers risk it all for family.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitahate the Hollywood morality in movies that guarantees they&#39;ll both die in the end
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDo people really think everyone in Texas walks around in cowboy hats?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME! ✊
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI am not exaggerating when I say that I have never been more excited for any movie ever
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDamn,this looks like a good one.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDude, it looks awesome! Love the old man at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=00m42s">00:42</a>; what a bad-ass...
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitalooking forward to seeing this movie,looks good
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitais this based on a true story? I&#39;m just trying to figure out the retro look the mustaches old pickup trucks
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie last night at a movie screening. Loved it. Probably one of the best Bank Robbery Movies I have ever seen. Great Story!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaChris who? Oh, yeah Captain Kirk...Ben Foster owned it in Alpha Dog AND <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=3m10s">3:10</a> To Yuma AND Lone Survivor, no more second fiddle for Ben, Hollywood, wake up!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait, looks awesome!!!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitasomething original for a chance
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaAbout time Hollywood made a good original movie and not a shitty remake.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaOccupy WallStreet but in North Dakota.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has got a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita&quot;We&#39;re not stealing from you, we&#39;re stealing from the bank.&quot; - line said in ever bank robbing movie.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else playing payday2?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t suck. I love a good western
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s singing this cover of &quot;Knocking on Heavens Door&quot;?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Because you asked little brother&quot;  got me cryin...cant wait to see this!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaBen Foster is an underrated actor.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t tell if Jeff Bridges has the same accent that he did in R.I.P.D. or True Grit  :P
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaYou, like, don&#39;t mess with Sheriff Dude!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaOh yes now this looks good! Only a matter of time before Chris Pine wins an Oscar
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, just can&#39;t stand shitty shoot out scenes.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaTwo reasons this movie will be great....1) Ben 2) Foster
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a> lol
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie last year when it was still in production back then it was called &quot;comancheria&quot; and saw the final version  on January and it was awesome.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome as fook
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitalooks good
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaIncluding the titular line in the trailer is a little on-the-nose, don&#39;t you think?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathe movie looks good it&#39;s sad they made this movie here in New Mexico and we didn&#39;t even get to meet the cast of the movie..
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=2m20s">2:20</a> this moment is sooooo cool. Knock knock knockin&#39; in heaven&#39;s door...
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita❤️❤️
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaBen dies, Gil gets shot but lives, Jeff let&#39;s Chris Flee and doesn&#39;t charge him, and the mama keeps the land. The film gets nominated for at least 5 academy awards. David gets cheated out of best picture by some B.S. like Captain America but walks away with best director. Ben or Jeff may take best supporting male actor but Chris falls short of best male actor. Meanwhile Taylor never gets the screenplay nomination because of the Robin Hood tie. That&#39;s my best guess but I still can&#39;t wait until August to see it.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaMonsters.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitayall see that the native american gentleman is jaqulines dad in kimmy schmidt ? :)
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaIt is kind of like I have stop watching trailers if I am interested in a movie or I will learn too much.  Anyway, I will see this.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWHAT? GIL BIRMINGHAM from House of Cards??? Yeah! I was just searching Duchovny&#39;s song, but THIS is way much better!<br>&quot;Knock, knock, knocking on heaven&#39;s dooorrrrrr... &quot;
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWow! Gil Birmingham was Jacob&#39;s father in Twilight. I&#39;m thrilled to see that he is in this film!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLike that line at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=1m09s">1:09</a>, &quot;Long enough to watch a bank get robbed that&#39;s been robbing me for 30 years.&quot; lol
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaChris Pines in a movie without 1000 lens flares flashing? I don&#39;t know what to think.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or does this have a No Country for Old Men vibe to it?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=00m21s">00:21</a> michael scott would be so proud
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathis is so exciting! this movie was mostly filmed in my town, thats my bank!! and the restaunt scene is in bills jumbo burger! ive sat in that very booth! i cant wait to see it
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathis is so exciting! this movie was mostly filmed in my town, thats my bank!! and the restaunt scene is in bills jumbo burger! ive sat in that very booth! i cant wait to see it
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThe soundtrack are freaking crazy, Assassin&#39;s Creed need to learn from this. Freagin&#39; Kanye West.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWho is playing the other Texas Ranger? Was that Gil Birmingham??
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaa modern western. Im in.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaDON&#39;T MAKE ME CHOOSE
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThe song name is Knockin&#39; on heaven&#39;s door by Blackwall
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaReally cool, last year I saw a early screening of this, no joke, i wont say any spoilers, but its really good, lots of No Country For Old Men vibes, but its quicker paced, story isnt as &quot;complex&quot; but Ben Foster kills it. Go see it guys when its released, I am thankful for the early screening ! It didnt even have a title then!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened to the Jeff Bridges who played regular characters?<br>Ever since The Dude he&#39;s been stuck playing hicks or hippies with facial hair.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLooks great. I&#39;ll definitely watch it. And can anyone please tell me who&#39;s covering the song? Can&#39;t find it anywhere.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaGreat Trailer.  Welcome to New Mexico
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaI said got-damn. It&#39;s like No Country For Old Men only I might not kill myself afterwards.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell is there a jump cut from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> <br>That is so god damn jarring
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLooking great! It&#39;s good to see Chris Pine in a variety of roles, he has more range than people realize. He&#39;s perfect as Kirk, but also wonderful in so many different roles.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQoqsKoJVDw&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a>, is that Tommy Lee Jones sitting at the window?
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or has Jeff Bridges really aged since Iron Man? I know Iron Man came out in 2008 but Jeff here looks like it came out in 1998
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaMarvel DC crossover is awesome.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaParts of this were filmed here in Clovis,NM!!!Western Bank looks good in the movies!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast and crew wish I could do this every day   Paul H Smith
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing! I can&#39;t wait to see it! 😳Chris Pine&#39;s character seems very interesting, especially. He brings a gravitas to the role.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitalove the trailer, seeing this movie opening night but I hate this new trend of having Mini-Trailers before the trailer even begins.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks better than C.A. CW
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitathis might actually not suck
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaMy home town too! Good ol&#39; Portales, NM!!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitamost of this movie was filmed in my hometown I can recognize alot of the things
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaLooking Goood !!!
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitareminds me a little of 48 hours except the bad guys are not stone cold psychopathic killers.....
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitagood to see spacker dave made a recovery
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaHey Everybody - Let&#39;s glorify complete and utter lawlessness and expect the violent crime rate to drop next year!<br><br>Films like these aren&#39;t without their cultural consequences (as fun as this movie looks). Think about that the next time you&#39;re on Fandango.
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaplease make a german syncro ❤
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaWhos cover is that ? Super good
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song??
JQoqsKoJVDwdelimeterByIshitaOh my god! Jeff Bridges is aTexas Ranger. Chris Pine and Ben Foster brothers and banks robbery?  I have to see &quot;Hell Or High Water&quot;.  It will be a lot of waiting until August. Thanks for amazing official Trailer.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaOh man. I love ritchie movies.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI am loving they are being the whole secret agents back and making it more action pack as well with a good sense of humor.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaTrailer looks good (but then, they always do). We get a feel for the characters, the relationship, the plot and tone of the movie and all looks good so far. Cavill looks like he can pull off Napoleon Solo but I&#39;m not sure about Armie Hammer. The accent sounds a little rough. And Illya really didn&#39;t have much of one (and David McCallum is a tough act to follow). The interplay between the two is as important as the plot. But at least it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re trying to be “campy”. And I sure hope the original theme music is in there. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWhen is the sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI really hope this movie has &quot;Danger Zone&quot; by Kenny Loggins in it.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWay to go Henry Cavill, finally playing James Bond after getting shut down for Casino Royale
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitalooks fucking good
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSorry, but the trailer doesn&#39;t do anything for me. Makes me only want to watch if its on Redbox with a freebie code or wait for Amazon Prime instant movies (which take forever to showup)
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaVery stylish. Armie needs to have his own superhero movie.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThat looks pretty good.  Normally not a fan of Guy Ritchie films but the stylistic choices here actually rubs me the RIGHT way.  And Cavill totally steals the show in this trailer.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaCavill would be perfect for an Archer movie.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI loved this show I use to watch the reruns before school every morning
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaguy ritchie&#39;s u.n.c.l.e. vs matthew vaughn&#39;s kingsman? FIGHT
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaArcher : The Movie
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI hope to see some original from the show make cameo. Like Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard of NCIS. He was the original Russian dude.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like fun!<br><br>But then... so did The Lone Ranger.<br>/c:
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaworth to watch just beacuse guy ritchie..
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks good, Guy Ritchie, I&#39;m in.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaGod Henry Cavill is such a weak actor, he looks unbelievably bad in this
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaIt looks like this is the year of the secret agent movies. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitawhat track is that at the beginning, sounds so familiar. is it pendulum, noisia, prodigy?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awesome! It&#39;s like a fun 60s spy movie. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitawill see gosts, from superman
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThey got the English actor playing the American and the American actor playing the Russian.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaIs that Archer The Movie?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThis look cool as all hell!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaMan of steel. Man of Uncle. I can dig it. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaGive us Cavill as Bond and Fassbender as Bond villain :) Epic team up  
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaDAMN IT! While watching this two things keep popping in my head. 1; I cant wait to see Cavill back as Superman 2- Cavill would make an amazing Bond!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaGuy Ritchie is one cool director. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaTMFU TV series had one of the greatest themes. And they couldn&#39;t utilize it at all for this trailer?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHenry &lt;333 I loved the trailer!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaNoisia - Stigma
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitafinally a live action Archer movie! 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaCodename Duchess the world most dangerous spy.. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks good
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaking of coolness, Guy Ritchie, is back. Hail the king
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWould have been better with Tom Cruise, but still looks good
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaMULLATO BUTTS!!!!!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitasuperman!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHalf-facetious, half-serious question: why get an English actor with a terrible American accent to play the American spy, and an American actor with a terrible Russian accent to play the Russian spy, when you could just cast an American and a Russian?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaNo thanks, Sherlock 3 please.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWell at least now we can confirm what we already knew: Man Of Shit wasn&#39;t Cavill&#39;s fault. He tried his damnest but Hack Snyder and The Goyer effed it up. Wish Cavill the best and hope for a TRUE Superman movie one day like Superman: The Animated Series, Birthright, and John Byrne&#39;s Man Of Steel.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHenry cavil would make awesome James Bond !!!why didn&#39;t they cast him for James Bond ??!damn!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s his Cockney accent?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThey should&#39;ve used Jerry Goldsmith&#39;s theme from the original series.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHated the tv show but this could be good 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitatake my money now!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitatrabant!!! 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a surprisingly fun spy flick. Plus it&#39;d be interesting to see Henry Cavill in a comedic role. Now where&#39;s that damn Batman v Superman trailer????
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaAmmm...This is  Superman: Red Son? No? very sad...
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaCan´t wait to see this movie!! The trailer is awesome... Henry Cavill is the best, love him since The Tudors &lt;3
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like an Archer movie :D
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like fun.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitalooks good ;-)
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaDoes this feel like the interview both in trailer and premise . Two guys go into restricted territory to accomplish somethin with spies involved . And one is Nazi and the other north Korea . Too soon Warner brothers 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna love this.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI usually skip ads.. but when this played as an ad, I continued watching the rest. Also not much of a fan of action films, but this looks interesting. :D
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just here for guy ritchie 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaOh, that time I met the lone Ranger, it was epic
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitait&#39;s awesome..!!! can&#39;t wait to watch it
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitathe first music:<br>noisia - stigma (drumstep)
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaAnyone think Henry Cavil looks like Matt Bomber?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitasong name &quot;lalalalalalalalala&quot; when they are driving? thanks, looks amazing this trailer
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaDude, c&#39;mon. James Bond is great bur c&#39;mon! Is that really a reason to spam every video with this?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaCan we forget about Superman vs Batman for just a moment? because this looks fucking amazing !!!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaNext movie to watch after Kingsman !
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooking forward into this !.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a fun movie. I guess spy movies are making a comeback. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaIm totally going to see this. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWould definitely watch this.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSo 2015.<br>Kinsman: the secret service <br>Mission impossible 5<br>The man from u.c.l.e <br>Hitman: agent 47<br><br><br>Interesting 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshita Henry Cavill can&#39;t act for shit. Sorry superman fanboys. But here he looks decent at best
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaIt like a live-action archer
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaArch?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaAfter all superman wasn&#39;t just a reporter...
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaAwful music track!!!  U.N.C.L.E. had wonderful music theme(s).. why not use it here?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWow, Cavill actually has charisma in this...love it
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSuperman is a spy!! ... coool!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaNeal, and you ?? kk
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaI was missing some Guy Ritchie in my life! He&#39;s back!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHim playing Superman will ruin his career.  All I see is Superman when I see Henry Cavill
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaShout out to the niggas who thought this was the new batman vs superman trailer when they saw the thumbnail
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaWell you&#39;ve sold at least one ticket! 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know much about the source material but looks like Bond meets Archer. Fun anyways.
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHoly crap, that was awesome!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaawesome movie. cant wait to see it
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaHenry doing this type of Spy film won&quot;t typecast him as Superman ,He was a candidate for Twilight/James Bond(too young)  .Honestly, Henry Cavill would make a Phenomenal  007 down the road.  Gud thing he got Superman role  instead.<br> He&#39;s a  British Actor pulling off an America accent for both Superman &amp; Napoleon Solo . Heck, I don&#39;t mind Henry Cavill being both <b>Superman &amp; James Bond</b> <br>Hopefully Armie hammer could pull his own -not a bad Russian accent there -i am intrigue by this film now<br><br><br>Superman &amp; Lone Ranger &gt;&gt; Nazi &#39;
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSuperman becoming James Bonds!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSuperman and the Lone Rangers are spies saving the world from Nazis.<br>.....<br>I am already buying 8 tickets for myself NERDGASM!
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaSo this is what Clark Kent would do if he had no powers
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLoving it. 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a fun action packed movie. Can&#39;t wait to see it 
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshita<br>Good!... where is the teaser of batman v superman ???
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know&#39;s who plays this version of &quot;I like funky music&quot;?
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaNice :D
4K4Iv_N9NnodelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty sweet.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitayup it&#39;s good! makes you think! stunning cinematography and visuals! there&#39;s some nudity though so don&#39;t let the kids watch and may be awkward watching with spouse... but great flick!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaVery good film. I wonder if the title is a ode to deus ex machina, the plot surely felt like it in my opinion. God from the machine!!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitai watched this and my feelings felt so betrayed
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so annoying. That guy is a rich psychopath. And his robots are freaks
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie the best film of the year.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaIs this a horror movie or a romance or just a movie. 😫 I&#39;m so confused
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaTrust me when I say.. it was a good movie.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaMovie was amazing
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaEx machina ex machina -cinimasins 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone notice writer Charles Stross&#39; hair and shaped beard on Oscar Isaac&#39;s Nathan? Probably deliberate. Ava&#39;s mesh skin was taken from the cover of the latest edition of Stross&#39; &quot;Saturn&#39;s Children&quot; or vice versa.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie. Not for the Ted 1, 2 or the &quot;Twilight&quot; saga crowd. The latter had white actors in Vampire pale face purposely replicating the look of opiate addiction (on and off screen), with deliberate B-movie dumb dialogue and acting. All the <b>*ingreedients*</b> of a successful Merkin movie. Ex Machina, just the opposite.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaSci-fi with a bit of Hitchcock. Ex Machina treads into the philosophical grounds surrounding AI, unlike other similar films that cash in on the drama or action.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitajust saw this movie on singapore airlines, really interesting, but somehow this trailer practically gives away 75% of the movie.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie! 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitawhat a crappy trailer
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitawatch it she kills everyone and manipulates the blonde guy!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaEx-Machina is a pure genius of a sci-fi classic. It&#39;s like a Stanley Kubrick film meets over Alfred Hitchcock and they combine it into a suspense film. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t spoil the movie and you know what happens in this twist ending? The film explains about a user who was selected from the Internet and he goes on a field trip to the unknown area where the mountains at. He meets a strange scientist who lives in his secret place and he explains the our main character that the area is the research of artificial intelligence of making robots come to alive. Then, he meets a gorgeous robotic woman who stays inside the room and the scientist wants him to be part of his research to communicate with the robot. He spends time with the robotic girl for few days until the room shuts down and the girl tells the truth that the scientist is a bad person who kept his secret between the robot and him. He tries to convince the scientist, but our main character was stuck in the research facility that he wishes to release the girl that he wants. What will happen that you trust with the robot that she turns just like human can do? Does he trust the robot that he cares or the robot is the one who behind all this? All the answers can figure it out unless you want the our main character to be saved. It&#39;s visually stunning that takes place in the strange area that makes you chill while you watch it and our main hero was shock and tense that he is in the strange room that makes it darker and scary. The two actors are great including our main hero is questionable and skeptical about the area and the scientist is unlikable, but he keeps it secret that he&#39;s a humble guy that you don&#39;t mess around with him. Eva was great and one of the best robotic characters ever with beautifully design of herself and the actress was great to become a robot who spends her whole time that she wants to be him or out. The direction is great with wonderful script, nicely cinematography, and great sci-fi idea to make it classic. It&#39;s a must see film that you prefer this movie a classic sci-fi film of the 2015. Great story, great acting, great actors, and wonderful shots. Ex-Machina is a pure genius film that the robot can relate. 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI wonder where is Wall-E.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good is this based off of deus x?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad to know they are using tin foil again :D
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a ton of work to make a sex doll. What ever happened to the good old days of jerking it to good housekeeping?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWow, spoilers all over the trailer.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaTo those who have seen the movie and the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; episode &quot;Be Right Back,&quot; does anyone else think it&#39;s kind of funny that Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb in &quot;Ex Machina&quot; and Ash in &quot;Black Mirror.&quot;  Because Caleb is a human talking to an android and Ash is an android talking to a human.  His role is essentially reversed in the film.<br><br>I thought it was funny.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this! Brilliant!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaAva seems to be a popular name in AI flicks
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitadrivel
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThe ending made me mad and threw me off 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie today and it was excellent. Seriously, go see it.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaExcellent concept and visual-shame about the one-dimensional acting by the two male leads. Best part was when they got knocked off.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaHe created a bitch..the end
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitathis gives me wood. Im gonna watch it tonight.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitadoes she have vagina?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaIf Howard stern says it&#39;s badass then it is.He said birdman sucked and it did.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitashould i go see this movie ? I Need to know if it&#39;s worth seeing
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI had high expectations for this movie and usually I&#39;m let down when I expect a movie to be really good. This one was even better than I expected. <br><br>Not to many movies have me thinking about them hours later and this I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaShe ends up playing tf outta him and killing everyone and escaping
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting! Alot of A.I. movies coming, are we being prepared for something bigger??
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaGhost in the Shell is still better.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggUmgeMCdc&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> What does Ava say? &quot;It&#39;s strange to a face that hates you&quot;
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaTalk about a movie that looked and acted smarter than it actually was. The acting, the ideas, the tone.. they have all been done before, but better. Aside from a couple moments of real intrigue, this was just ridiculously bland. Absolutely nothing revealed was a surprised. Nothing. Cerebral film making takes more than ambient music and pretty backdrops. This definitely does not work as a psychological thriller.<br><br>I&#39;d suggest checking out Under the Skin. it&#39;s not without its problems, but it actually works a a movie that hits you deep and you&#39;ll be glad you didn&#39;t miss it.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitathing is that this trailer kind of ruins the movie...
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was great.  I recommend not watching this trailer though.  Just go watch it.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what beer they are drinking at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggUmgeMCdc&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a>

bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t go see boring ass hell
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI just blew my load !!!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaSimon Curtis&#39;s song In Love With An Android comes to mind. xD
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitathis looks extremely good
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaBest movie iv seen in a long time. It&#39;s brilliant! 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaGreat, now I feel like I&#39;ve already seen the movie.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaJust watched &quot;Ex Machina,&quot; and it DELIVERED!  No dine in, no carry-out, just delivery.  5 out of 5 stars
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaSaturn 3?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitacalling it- the guy is a robot, too.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis could&#39;ve been a great episode of Black Mirror.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaEVAA (Wall-E)
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWow... interesting 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaSo good!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWow, the sound mixing in this trailer is terrible... The movie looks like it could be good though.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaIs this seriously only gunna be playing in NY and LA?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaDiscount ghost in the shell. <b>DING</b>
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks... Wow.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaMessing with emotions I see. Yeah, that would be hard. I can definitely see myself getting attached to a robot lol.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaKara!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaAnd after this ALEX GARLAND makes DREDD 2.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshita-- Ghost In The Machine ?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshita-- Deus EX ?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitatinder brought me here
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaIs this based on the comics? 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitairobot did it 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaYAAAASSSSS!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good. It looks like one of those movies that will pull you in as if you&#39;re in the film itself. I hope it isn&#39;t ruined by some bullshit ending that kills the whole thing. 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaGrant Morrison was right! the robots are trying to fuck us! thank Frankie Boyle for the insightful interview
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitawhy do i think he is the robot...duh. duh. duuuhhhhh
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song @ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggUmgeMCdc&amp;t=0m57s">0:57</a>?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaEx Machina means &quot;from machine&quot; for anyone who doesn&#39;t know :)
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitais this the future or nah?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaOh sweet, irobot 2
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaOh cool. Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson, this new Star wars looks different but good
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis just another take on splice.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaGod I can&#39;t wait to see this movie 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThere are no strings on that chick.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaRemind anyone of Quantic Dreams&#39; &quot;Kara&quot;? I want this to be good but it looks like their genre&#39;s all over the place. They could&#39;ve been a sci-fi thinkpiece, but they had to try to be a romance and a horror and an action, too.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s a machine, he&#39;s a machine, ehh whatever.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the point of region-blocking a movie trailer anyway?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaCalling it now: Dude that came to test Ava is most likely a robot himself. A twist that M. Night Shyamalan would be proud of!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitatake my money!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI was more interested before seeing the trailer which makes it look like a horror film.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaDoes anymore else get the feeling that the guy that came to test the machine is actually a machine himself and is being tested?
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitadeus
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThe audio fidelity in this trailer is pretty awful. Movie looks great.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI call BS on the fact that one man can not create true AI alone.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI hope this is half as good as it looks.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaRestrições de países para vídeos como este é simplesmente inaceitável, porcaria de abuso 
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks deliciously complex. But I think a preview I saw about six months ago may have already ruined the movie.
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitawhat?? another terminator rip off?? &quot;GASP&quot;
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaAnother tragic movie about a scientist who mistakenly installs evil red LED&#39;s all over the place causing Robots to go mad and kill everyone. Awesome :D
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this already!
bggUmgeMCdcdelimeterByIshitaMeh..
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaDr. Cox has been drinking again.

jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaWhat do they mean 60
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaspoiler much?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitalooks a great day to call seek.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaWhen the cost of survival is your humanity with no guarantee of safety, you would succumb. This plot is flawed.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaMovie would be 10x better if they had The Office casted in this film
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaIs this a metaphor about how the elite view us commoners, encouraging us to be vicious to get a job position?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaLooks kind of intriguing.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaIs that Tony Goldwyn in the office in the beginning ?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitahow to become more desensitized 101
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitasaw meets office
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaC.H.E.A.P.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitawas that the guy who plays yondu?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this movie has a pretty similar concept to The Circle
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitabasically seems like everyones gonna end up dead
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaVeridian Dynamics has really crossed the line this time
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP2Ow2CX6OQ&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> <br>better watch out. they might make a virgin sacrifice.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitalol sad.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitadangaronpa omg
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis could either be really good or really bad
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaNo sorry I&#39;m watching feel good movies I can see this on any news feed
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThe movie feels like NonStop and The Purge. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CrayCray">#CrayCray</a>
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaSo the hunger games x the office?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaFirst purge then clowns now...THIS <br>THE WORLD IS GOING TO END!!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitathis is freaking scary! imagine this happening at your work building...the cringe is real
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaAbsurd.  How many more of these movies will they make:  people trapped and have to kill each other to survive.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaI have full faith in anything James Gunn is attached to
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaconcept isnt really original. but im not saying im not going to watch this. lol.<br><br>from handsome and masculine squid
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaLAME.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaKill your boss the movie?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaHurr Durr, it&#39;s like Battle Royal. Better not watch it now! &gt;.&lt;
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks a little promising
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a flop BUT it&#39;s written by James Gunn so I&#39;m automatically looking out of it
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaSimilar to the Purge
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaSHOOK LITERALYY
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited!! Been waiting a year for this to come out
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThe purge meets saw meets the hunger games meets battle royale meets the office
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaBattle Royal meets Office Space!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaGonna make $47.50 at the box office.  Stupid premise.  Locked in by unobtanium shutters?  Really?  And people would actually submit to having something implanted in their heads for a job?  Well, liberals would probably go along with that last one.  This is Netflix material, not box office.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshita<b>&quot;The Office&quot; theme music queues</b>
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaSaw meet Office Space.<br><br>pass.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitapurge meets nerve? seems redundant enough
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaHEY its cabin in the woods again!!!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaToo predictable been done before. I&#39;ll just watch Battle Royale.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaBattle Royale xD
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaActually looks good tho
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaand the girl always lives.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaBattle Royale : The Office

jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitayawn...
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaBattle Royal anyone?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaMay the odd be ever in your favor?  I feel like I have seen this film 400 times already.  Nothing new here.  Although I do like a good exploding head ... so there is that....
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaOh somebody offers me a new job but I will have to let them implant a chip in my head. HELL NAW!!!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like crap!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaLame-O. So when you start work here they inject you with a tracker? Yea, don&#39;t wanna work there.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaI just feel like this is going to be like the 2 ships scene in The Dark Knight. The people running this experiment won&#39;t actually kill the employees, they&#39;re just testing them to see if they&#39;ll actually kill each other.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaBattle Royale in an office
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaNope.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaso is this like the adult version of battle Royale?
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaWell that was impressive.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitawell umm... that was tense.
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaso.. like danganropa but in anoffice steeing and no trial
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaWho would willingly put a tracer in the back of their head for a job
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaI bet y&#39;all there&#39;s gonna be one survivor
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP2Ow2CX6OQ&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a> he got that &quot;terrified&quot; emotion just right

jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitag
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so gonna flop
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaThis concept seems too familiar...
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitaIf only I had a day off
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitawow what A story can&#39;t wait. 👌
jP2Ow2CX6OQdelimeterByIshitawow what A story can&#39;t wait. 👌

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this one<br>
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitawhy are black pepole supporting movies like this.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see that looks so sad<br>
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThe film sounds interesting. Maybe I&#39;ll bring my family and friends to take a look.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaJust seen this, Great movie with a great cast...
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaAn amazing &amp; powerful movie regardless of your race &amp; ethnicity. It truly makes you question American history &amp; the context of the time. Can&#39;t say enough about the beautiful imagery as well as the horrific moments which will make you cringe &amp; contemplate how people justified this tragic &amp; barbaric time as well as those who have he audacity to be apologists for it now. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWowwww.......I know I&#39;m gonna cry on this movie this weekend...AND it&#39;s my time of the month?? Yeah ima be bawling in the theatre!!!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s horrible how people thought this was ok....
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaMichael fainted during the rape scene<br>
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshita1) Try to imagine how much brainwashing it would take to convince all the Asians in the world, that within their own countries, they need to go ahead and replace their children and grandchildren with Mexicans<br>2) Now imagine that they were so totally mind conditioned and brainwashed, that they really believed it would be “RACIST” not to???<br>If you manage to do that: Welcome to the world of the White Anti-Whites!!<br>There’s NOTHING dumber than a White Anti-White<br>Anti-racist is a code for anti-White
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a racist movie. This is history.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWhy is so many racist movies coming out now, knowing economy is bad and racist is back on the rise.. This like the third racist movie i heard of this year.. The Butler, Djangle and now this.. I never forget slavery and neither will my kids, but right now these movies need to stop is they trying to make a race war?
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYeah because white people invented slavery. Its been around since the beginning of time at all four corners of the Earth. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIts strange that white americans can say Slavery happen along time ago so get over it but evolution (if  there is such a thing) happened what thousands of years but i bet they don&#39;t want to forget about that. Also its not just the effects of slavery now count the 40+ years of segregation and that is not so long ago. So no we won&#39;t just forget it especially when you have parents that went through it.

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI wouldn&#39;t say white people need to be ashamed at this day and age because for 1 the people who owned slaves are dead and gone now. Yes there are still racist people in the world, white &amp; black people included. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Gladiator,&quot; &quot;Schindler&#39;s List.&quot; or &quot;Gone With The Wind.&quot; All those movies, in theme, are not dissimilar.

Just judging by the trailer, anyone who can watch this film and not flinch, is uncanny. You must be otherworldly. I may just got see this film after all.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaSlavery has had a compounding effect, existing even in this present world. Is that a crutch to be leaned on? An &quot;excuse&quot; to be tossed out when the going gets tough for people of color, particularly in this country? No. Just a fact.  

It would be easier on the conscience of many White people to not produce these sort of films, especially in such an unflinching way. But, would it be fair? Would it be right? If movies like &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;Amistad&quot; or, yes, &quot;12 Years&quot; don&#39;t have a place, neither do...
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaor watching any film on race/inequity. Many whites (won&#39;t say most) have that idea that it could just be another &quot;blame whitey&quot; film. That would be a colossal mistake. Some blacks, on the other-hand, may look at this as a &quot;stick it to the man&quot; sort of film. Both points of view are rooted in pride, some might even say immaturity. 

While I don&#39;t believe that any one person should eternally suffer for the &quot;sins of their father,&quot; slavery/racism has a legacy in this country. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI used to believe that racism/bigotry (maybe I still do) was the absolute WORST form of villainy that could possibly be imposed on another human being. Probably because the implication is that you don&#39;t even have the right to exist. Who gives any man the power/go-ahead to wield that sword?

While I don&#39;t view &quot;slavery&quot; films as separatists films - not in the traditional sense - I do think there are many people who will find their true natures bubbling to the surface after hearing about...


z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI am a black male, one who has yet to see this film (if you can call it that, perhaps experience is a better word). I think there have been few, if any, accurate depictions of slavery in film. Most, seem to be told from the perspective of the slave trader or owner. 

To me, the best way to accurately and, respectfully, depict slavery is to show it from the point of view of the ones held in bondage. This film has been a hit, even still in its infancy. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand how White people in America can tell me and my people to forget OUR history. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re paying for what your ancestors did. The most you experience is being called racist , compared to what this person went through? That&#39;s like rapist blaming the victim for what happened to them. When people are honest and say yes this happened, that&#39;s when the victim will be able to move past it, not acting like it didn&#39;t happen.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaHans Zimmer
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitacan someone tell me who&#39;s the composer of this movie ?
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIf this was about ANYTHING other than &quot;slavery&quot;, people might actually notice the BAD script and lousy acting.  So much for diversity ... here comes further division!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think it is just white people I think its just people in general if u ask me 

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis was a wonderful movie but, made me very sad and very hurt !!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWho was really behind Slavery in the Americas?? An African American scholar exposes truths about slavery that never made the Primetime News or the History Books. No revelation of truth could be more shocking than what you&#39;ll learn here in this shorter 10:01  version of his lecture about who was really behind African Slavery in the Americas.  By Dr. Tony Martin PhD Historian of Trinidad. Cut &amp; paste (to Youtube) this must see Dr.Tony Martin 10:01 speech---&gt;

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie.. It gave me chills just watching the trailer!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaHaha Brad Pitt!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaCan you imagine if people said we shouldn&#39;t make holocaust movies because &quot;it&#39;s done get over it&quot;
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a white conservative an I&#39;ve been telling people about this film.  I think most whites have some form of disconnect with slavery because it was so long ago.  Most people are critical of things that paint them in a bad light.  I hope many people take the time to watch this film and get another or better perspective.  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaLANA BANANA!!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitayou do know this was referring to egiptians handling the Hyksos dynasty.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitasome of our own race did sold some of our people into this kidnapping and abuse. however your ancestors RAPED,BEATEN, ABUSED. then continued to belittle our people when this kidnapping period was over. then jim crow
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitalmfao!!! America&#39;s Hollywood always ONLY choose to reveal the kidnapping and abuse of negroids. never display the FREE MOORS who sailed here during this period from Africa&#39;s Mauratania. or the Dark Skinned, Wooly Haired Pure blood Indigenous who NEVERED experienced kidnapping and abuse by the &#39;settlers&#39;. why don&#39;t anyone knows that HISTORY????? can you say COVER-UP????
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitadude, you obviously lack what other white people have..which is why ur so cynical.  Your cynicism, anger, and hostility is contributed to the fact that you cannot and do not know how to find happiness for yourself.  The only white people who make these type of notions have nothing besides their &quot;whiteness&quot; and use the accomplishments of other whites as their own.. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is based off an autobiography written by the main character, and not just a fictional story. I highly recommend the book.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaLOL! Whoever this Hitler guy is, is proving my point. Smh. Stop living in the Stone Age! Segregation shouldn&#39;t exists! Whites like blacks and vice versa but television and movies brainwash people to think otherwise.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitathis is more BULLSHIT they&#39;re feeding you!! wake up ya&#39;ll!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think anyone is blaming america for &quot;inventing&quot; slavery. that&#39;s kind of a odd idea.

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaCan someone please tell me the song that is being played at the very beginning of the trailer? It&#39;s the same song that plays throughout the movie (the only song I remember) Thank you, what an amazing film....
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaHow appropriate his name is Solomon Northup in the movie. I like it.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI read parts of Fredrick Douglas&#39; &quot;My Bondage &amp; My Freedom&quot; and was absolutely amazed at how little I knew about the life of a slave!: Imagine not even knowing your own birthday or everyone being forced to wear the same size shoes!! The basic human rights which we take for granted are non existent!!  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should be required viewing in every college.  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIndeed..
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll say this, Everyone should take a African American experience class. It is very enlightening and a lot of ignorance on these comments would not even be made. Better yet it will make you realize that a lot of what you think you know about histoy is false.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI disagree. What is bothersome to a lot of Americans is that people want to act like that was the only country that had slavery, and as if the 200 years it existed there somehow eclipses the thousands of years slavery has existed in the world. Americans did not &#39;invent&#39; slavery. Also, many people want to ignore the fact that it was AMERICANS that ended the slavery in their own country. So quit using a broad brush to paint everyone. Thanks. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaJudgment day will be tell tell for lots of generations of rebels. No government for statues of protection will be present in the court room. Civil wont be needed.  Lord have mercy on the oppressors.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIf you or your ancestors didn&#39;t like Africans so much, why didn&#39;t they just leave us in Africa? We weren&#39;t bothering you and don&#39;t give me that &quot;Because you were good workers&quot; crap. If racist couldn&#39;t stand the sight of us, then why kidnap us and for e yourselves to look  at us all day and night? Some of your ancestors even RAPED some of the slave women! Hmm? It&#39;s a shame that we didn&#39;t learn anything from slavery but judgment day will be here and you&#39;ll all have to answer to God.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitawhat about my white girlfriend?
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaLast time I checked, races don&#39;t hold collective opinions. So when you say not one race wants blacks - it&#39;s nonsensical. 

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaTell me again genius how billions of people can be the same entity?
That&#39;s like saying blacks are Tommy Lee Jones. It makes no sense.
Whites are nothing but individual people. Just like blacks, Mexicans, Jews, Arabs, etc......only by meeting the individual can you then pass judgment. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaLike if you Ever Scared A white boy 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYes, a unjust state law the deprived people of their constitutional rights.That&#39;s why the senate passed the 14 amendment to make it a federal law to protect people&#39;s constitutional rights.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaUNREAL.

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaBlacks gave away or sold blacks to slavery. Not one race in the world likes or wants blacks around only self-loathing brainwashed whites and other blacks when your not doing drive by greetings.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Any one who treats his fellow man as less than himself shall burn in hell for all eternity in penance for his crimes against humanity.&quot; That is the new scripture.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYou think, it&#39;s just that simple, huh?  Maybe, nowadays, but have you ever heard of Segregation?
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaA chance to go back to Africa after, being stripped of freedom, stolen from land, held in captivity, and enslaved, exploited, stripped of culture, religion, dignity, family bond, knowledge of self, beliefs, and after spending Centuries in a Country the offspring of Slaves every known?  I think not!  America is home to African Americans, Native Americans(Indians), and Jewish Americans just as much as, White oppressors.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYou poor thing.  A some point, you just veered off into the land of delusion.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaOf course I don&#39;t agree,I think those laws were put in place to correct the injustices a lot of minority people had to deal with.Being denied housing jobs and basic decencies because their race or any other reason.It was a stark hypocrisy  against the constitution of the land.I live in GA and I see a lot of neighborhoods that are still 100% white and I have no problem with that.I do have issue if I had the money to live there and I can&#39;t because of my race,sorry that&#39;s not right for anyone.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing. Great actor. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThese are the worst comments I&#39;ve seen in a long time.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThe creed is that all men in America will have the right to live free and have the pursuit of happiness.Meaning you can&#39;t have things one way for one people and another way for others.In America every is suppose to be under the same law.Assimilation for you is just the right for all people in America to be able to live and work were ever they chose without restriction due to race.If you don&#39;t want to live around other races buy a piece of land and build a giant wall that should do it.  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s very disturbing that so many white Americans are very reluctant and critical of films that truly portray the real brutality of slavery.  I&#39;m tired of hearing people say, &quot;Slavery is done.  Get over it.&quot;  Really?  People are that ignorant to think that ALL of the effects of 200+ years of slavery should be resolved in less than 150 years?  To all of those who express this belief:  You reflect a serious ignorance toward history, biology, and human existence.  Educate yourselves.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWell I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m not ani-white or anti anything else from any other race of people.The so called forced assimilation of America is the creed of the constitution.That all men that live in this country should be treated equally.If you have a problem with people of other races and that is your right,you can move to Russia which is still 98% white.No one is forced to live around anyone they don&#39;t want to but if a the laws apply to one is should apply to all.  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaCan someone please tell me why every movie they make with blacks we are either a butler, maid or slave in 2013?  If it&#39;s not one of Tyler Perry wack relationship movies we are slaves.  
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis happened more often than people think. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWTF??? Another gadamn yes sir masta slave movie, that&#39;s like the 3rd one this year. How about  KISSin MY BLACK ASS HOLLYWOOD!!!! See if you could find some producers for that shit (Middle finger up bitches).
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s just stupid,you have white people in Africa and they call it their land south Africa,ever heard of it!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWe perish from the lack of knowledge. You must know where you came from to know where your going too. Chiwetel, thank you for all your great performances over the years.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know there was a time limit on suffering.Just because other people don&#39;t want to acknowledge/watch that this happened, doesn&#39;t mean we have to stop talking about.Yes,we should also have discussions on how to heal from it.But alot of people,especially black youth,don&#39;t understand what slaves endured,overcame &amp; still managed to better themselves.This is inspirational, not &quot;propaganda&quot;
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s funny to me that a film about a period of time is considered &quot;race dividing&quot; or &quot;celebrating slavery&quot;. When mainstream Hollywood makes period pieces, they polish over America&#39;s ugly history. When black film makers portray things that have happened,the way they happened, then everybody has a problem. Slavery happened. It was probably the ugliest thing America has done,other than dropping H bomb.A race of people are still struggling to cope w/ the rippling effects.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaIm dying to watch this movie.  I&#39;ll getting chills just watching the previews.  Its going to be epic.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaBUT PROB WONT HAPPEN HOLLYWOOD&#39;S GOTTA KEEP THAT LEVEL OF MORONIC RACE DIVIDING IGNORANCE AT ALL TIME HIGHS ALONG WITH MSNBC AND THE CIA FUNDED NEW BLACK PANTHER PARTY.... WHILE THEM AND OTHER CORPORATIONS BLEED AMERIKA DRY....... 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWill Smith is cool
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI cannot wait to see it!  Nobody cares about y&#39;all&#39;s points on racism , let it go lol.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaOnly black people wallow in slavery, keep it alive, celebrate it and pay other races to see themselves portrayed as cowardly, uneducated, trifling and primitive.

Image is everything and self imagery is the first battle being fought in the revolution of evolution. Stop watching movies whereas our-self imagery is devalued, desensitized, demonized, humiliated, degraded and negatively entrench....at the very least... stop paying for it.

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitado you know how GAY you look? cant tell if youre a kluxin inbred or a gay pride dork
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshita along justin beever.. grown folks r talking..
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYes during those times there were white slaves as well but they were referred to as indentured servants.. they were to work off debts from monies owed. they were not stolen or sold into slavery but they did enter into contracts for a particular time period in order to work off a debt and they had to fulfill said contract.

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitathanks! that&#39;s what we like to do!

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not racist.  not at all... unless pointing out what was done to my forefathers.  Action by our own government has destroyed black communities. This is not a racist view... Only the perspective of someone who survived in a broken community where unjust courts, violent police, and cocaine smuggled into our communities have cased so much destruction. No other race has just accepted it without some kind of reparation.  Japanese, Jews, Native American, thay all have been &amp; still are compensated.

The process to report abusive users is explained from there.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThe past actions against black people by whites in American was one of the most shameful act of humanity in history.  100 million blacks killed during the time of slavery.  Then all of the assassinations, drug smuggling, lynchings, unjust incarcerations ... and so on. We are Still dealing with the destruction.  Also, don&#39;t forget that  Attacking, maiming, raping, and murder has Always been celebrated, practiced, and encouraged by white folks against blacks. That&#39;s the truth and nothing but.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaHollywood actors like Pitt are race-traitors &gt; jewtools &gt; trash.

WhiteID com
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaWon the &quot;Audience Award&quot; at Toronto!  Never been, hope to go!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaProud of Lupita Nyong&#39;o....Go Kenya!!!!!!!!!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaRead the book, and am so pleased that a motion picture has been made based on the true story.  Cannot wait to see it!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaYou seem to be talking from a high standpoint.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitathis movie might be this best thing to come out this year. Steve McQueen is such a great director and Fassbender what a great actor

z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThe autobiography Twelve Years A Slave by Solomon Northup is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend reading it. I will be watching this film. 
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaThis guy is a great director I am sure it won´t be boring!
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaboring
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshita12 years? Well he did well, considering slavery in the US lasted over 200 years. I guess some people need the &#39;inspirational&#39; story to distract from the reality.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaSo many great actor here! I love it
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitafassbender and pitt together again so soon.
z02Ie8wKKRgdelimeterByIshitaLookst interesting!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitawhy is he so well shaved?  I read the book.  He should look stinky.

ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitathis looks like the greatest movie... of... mankind...
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaHmmm space movies.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThis looks like such a fun film, but serious at the same time. I can&#39;t wait to watch it.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita&quot;Brought laptop to the surface of mars and it broke. 0/10&quot;
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIf you want to watch the movie and haven&#39;t read the book, do not watch this trailer. Pretty much spoils the whole movie.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaedgy
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not saying that they stole my somewhat how I edited my version but they kinda did steal it.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaMan this looks like a good movie. It is second only to Star Wars for me for most anticipated this year.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaSaving Astronaut Ryan!!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIt will be awesome!!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaYes! Yes! and before I forget, YES! I loved this book and Matt Damon is perfect actor for the main character. Honestly A dream come true.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaAnd now I have seen the whole movie. <br>Only question is it is one of those hero stories where Mat Diamond survives, or one of those dark sad movies when he don&#39;t.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaRIP Sean Bean&#39;s Character
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitathis movie looks so good
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaDr. Mann has returned!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaOf course he&#39;ll survive, it&#39;s Jason Bourne in space.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita19th 😀
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWhy does it feel like I just watched the whole movie already.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWas that Sean Bean @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a>?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaI would just like to thank you for giving away so much of the movie. <b>sigh</b>

ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWoah~ This looks awesome! :D<br>Can&#39;t wait for this to come out!<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TheMartian">#TheMartian</a>

ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWouldn&#39;t is be cool if a life form from another planet helped get back home? That&#39;s what I was hoping for
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaRead the book and looking forward to this. One question though: How are they going to justify killing off Sean Bean&#39;s character?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaMurph!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaCan you upload it so i can watch it on 21:9 monitor without black stripes?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitabino????
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThey should have cast Tom Hanks, and made it a sequel to Cast Away.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWait they gave him a family... why? And the Habitat is solid?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaI was apprehensive when I heard this was being made into a movie because the book, aside from the technical bits, was so bad. But I must admit that I&#39;m looking forward to watching it.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita104 views and 751 likes, you had one job Youtube.<br>bring back 301 club please!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThe trailer is very good, and makes me want to see it RIGHT NOW... really good. But why did you have to show the potato farm? Why?????
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThe one thing Matt Damon&#39;s character has going for him is that Sean Bean is playing someone in this movie, and there&#39;s a good chance he&#39;s not making to the end credits.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaSo Sean Bean is in it, i think that i allready know how is it gonna end for him in dis movie. :D
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaHeck YEAH!      So Excited!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m still here for the potato farm.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaExcited to see this! Also hoping Ridley Scott follows through with Wool.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThis looks great and it seems like they&#39;ll do the book justice (unlike Ender&#39;s Game and other sci-fi adaptations).
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWait, when did Watney get a wife and kid? Hmmm.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitari
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaUnder 301 club is here.<br>This movie is gonna be AMAZING
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitano no no <br><br>dont save him!<br><br>we know what he done at INTERSTELLAR!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaSean Bean &gt; NASA
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIn Space No One Can Hear You Scream!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaHe has a family in the movie?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita85 views?!?!?!?!?!?!?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita&quot;Why can aqua man control whales when they&#39;re mammals?&quot;
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaNo disco soundtrack? One of my favorite running gags in the book.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaYeah I&#39;m seeing this
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIf the movie&#39;s going to be as awesome as these trailers promise, that film will be AWESOME AS HELL!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8&amp;t=1m14s">1:14</a> &#39;&#39;Mein Gott!&#39;&#39; XD
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaWow, this looks really great! I loved the book, some bits were absolutely hilarious, so I&#39;m looking forward to seeing this movie! XD
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaHell yeah! So keen for this! I love that there are a lot of sci-fi blockbusters coming out :)
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaJessica is everywhere
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaI just hope it keeps true to the book, one of the things about the book was that it kept the science as realistic as possible. This was probably one of my all time favorite books, and while Matt Damon as Mark Watney is EXACTLY who I pictured when reading the book... I just hope they can capture all the intricacies of the novel that made it so fantastic and thrilling. I really don&#39;t want this to be a dumbed down version. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TheMartian">#TheMartian</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BringHimHome">#BringHimHome</a>

ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaClub 43 babeh!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIf you are reading this before watching the trailer, don&#39;t watch it. <br>Go straight to the theater and enjoy every moment of this glorious story because this trailer contains spoilers.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaLiked the first trailer better as a trailer, but this one gives ore insight in what the tone will (hopefully) be. The movie better be good!
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaHello :)
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaYeah, was a good movie.  Hollywood ending.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaFirst
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be so awesome.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThis looks bloody amazing.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t it the Martinez family on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a>? Bc they made it look like it&#39;s Watney&#39;s in a second time, lol
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaDo people that write the scripts for these actually read the source material?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitais there going to be an interstellar 2? is this a prequel?
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaThese trailers honestly look like the book leaped from the pages right onto the screen. Which is how it should be. The book is absolutely perfect, no need to change anything. Can&#39;t freaking wait for this movie. Also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>, Rich Purnell is a steely eyed missile man.
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaNot a sport
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaA worthy opponent for Interstellar! Oh I cannot wait
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaUnder 30 club
ej3ioOneTy8delimeterByIshitaJimi Hendrix to be featured in two major trailers like two weeks apart. Coincidence? I think not.

Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaGot an extreme King Kong vibe from this.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry, but the CG for Tarzan himself looks horrible. Why not just have him actually swing?
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaJane is American lol
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitathis feels kind of joyless
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitathis was down right incredible
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitasamuel jackson and snakes in the junggle?
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s seem pretty intense :P
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks damn good and Margot Robbie is a plus :D
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, anything to get my mind off that horrible Batman v Superman second trailer.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitawhy does this movie remind me more of christopher lamberts greystoke then tarzan ??
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThat.<br>Was.<br>Fucking.<br>BANANAS.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! Can&#39;t wait!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT.Take my Money!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitathe cgi is soooooo bad
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Mowgli from the Jungle book has got some competition, lets see who&#39;s really king of the Jungle when this film drops!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThe team responsible for designing scenery at Warner bros are amazing at what they do
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaNOW we just need the Lion King  👑!!!!!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaKing Kong plus dawn of apes, was Tarzan always that epic? seems like unnecessary epic CGI, at least Margot Robbie looks hot
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitanice Wb nice
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re Tarzan  king of the jungle Tarzaaaaaaan.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaWow, the cast looks promising
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaAhhhhhh meu bolso Hihiiii
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaeric northman all juiced up
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaCAN WARNER BROTHERS DO A KING KONG REMAKE PLEASE
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLeave it up to warner bros to make Tarzan dark and gritty😭
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaI don´t get it, there´s been countless of Tarzan movies and CGI animals have always looked fake as fuck. Even costumes look more realistic.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaNot exactly happy like the animated one but....looks good. Except some of the cgi looks weird
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks unexpectedly great. The second I saw Christoph Waltz, I was hooked.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitamas Tarzan num é da Disney?
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaDAT ROAR <br>If there was something that gave me chills as a kid it was that.﻿<br>Reminds of(in the Disney version) when he defeated Sabor.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaSo wait in this one it is after he has gone back to society?
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaking kong is back this movie gives us a great taste of king kong skull island coming in 2017 but i know its tarzan can&#39;t wait
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaU see the white on ur screen? That ain&#39;t the background..
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaHoly faurkkkkkkkkkkkk this looks epic!!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaCgi. Cgi evreywhere
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of King kong
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaChristopher Waltz does not really fit the role as the uncle even though he is an amazing actor he would be more likely to try and shake one of the gorillas hands and then pull out a revolver and shoot it than be the goody uncle in the cartoon tarzan movie .
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaKing Kong vibes with George of the jungle
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks better than that piece of shit animated movie from 2013. (NOT THE DISNEY FILM FROM 1999)
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like PUSSY shit.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s good to see my childhood be continued
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaWait that&#39;s  the same music from halo 4 forward unto dawn.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis and the new live action Jungle book are looking good. Sure we can complain about the lack of original ideas but we can also be happy with what were getting and so far, and I have hope for these two movies.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaSo we are going to get two movies with Margot Robbie next summer? YESSSS!!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaI do not know what to say, it will certainly be the best version . AMAZING!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitayeah, sure lets give this a second chance.. we all know how that ends up..
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaHarley Quinn in the jungle?!<br>Why not!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson is in this?  Why haven&#39;t I heard of this before, what?!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaMargot &lt;3
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitacant wait to see this movie and the jungle book but seriously why is Samuel L. Jackson in every movie i see
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaOut of all the live-action Tarzan movies out there, this makes them look all like shit
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaJane looks hot
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty damn cool man
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaEnglish Tarzan, DO YOU SPEAK IT?!?

Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitavery nice teaser lol
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome!!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting too much of a King Kong/ Planet of the aps vibe from this. I hope they do the tale justice.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThe Best puts
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaSo we have both Jungle Book and Tarzan coming  out in 2016, awesome!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds of King Kong, but this time, Kong is a man. Love it!
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up if you had the PS2 game of this ?
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaMargot Robbie, the only reason I would watch this
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaWait Tarzan has human pants not like the Disney animatied version where he wears loin cloth.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitagenial
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is the movie no need to watch it now :)
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitala verdad muy buena se ve y es un tráiler no un teaser warner aprende a diferenciar lmao
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Eric Northman has been bulking up.
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitanot bad
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaThis characters means a lot to me, and even with m worries about the story lind that they used, this actually looks really cool! I hope they maintane this tone!

Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitadammmmmm!!!!!! cant wait omg!!!!! no for real cant wait 😄
Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaNo one cares about The Legend of Tarzan. It has great movies already. Do you wanna know which movie we&#39;re all excited about ?

Aj7ty6sViiUdelimeterByIshitaola
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaIN 3-D and 2D (yes lol) in THEATERS! 

Looks awesome.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaDO WANT
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@Drayco91 whos inside?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@Alairic dont mean to be in the hulk vs thor thing, but Thor vs hulk in the comics, hulk ran away sometimes, and that Hulk Vs thor movie was crap, how wolverine bring hulk to his knees and thor get beat like that, yeah right. hulk and thor are evenly matched if u ask me
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@staley1981. Yeah but this is the Marvel movie universe! Just like ultimate marvel is not 616 marvel universe! People need to know what there talking about! HULK VS.. WAS MADE FOR HULK FANS IT WAS A HULK DVD! They had to power hulk up! And Hulk got taken out by a hellicopter missle so Thor would own him with a god blast or uber thunderstrike! THOR took crimson Dynamos missles like nothing! Please! HULK SURVIVES ON POPULARITY! Thor slays all matter of monster Hulk is nothing new!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThis Movie gonna be best hero movie in 2011 nuff said...good job Marvel and Ken Branaugh, or however u spell it lol
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@captainkickazz360. Well sadly this aint the Hulk vs..universe is it? This aint Marvel 616 universe either is it? THIS IS MARVEL MOVIE UNIVERSE AND I&#39;M SORRY BUT MOVIE THOR WOULD MURDER MOVIE HULK! Sorry to disapoint you! They are not the same! Anybody who argues is dilusional and just a die hard fanboy! TRUTH HURTS!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaSince when did Asgard relocate to japan?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@captainkickazz360 actually Alairic is right.  Thor has killed Hulk, twice.  Once in Thor 73 volume two and the other time in What if 45.  Both those times were without his hammer Mjolnir.  Hulk vs. Thor cartoon was botched; besides Hulk lost to Hawkeye and Black Widow in another cartoon.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaGod, I hope Schumaker doesn&#39;t take over making a sequel for this, and has thor become a frog like in the comics. *Shudder*
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita...no helmet, no Thor...just a dude that appeals to Mtv....I will still go see it...
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaWow it actually looks good! I was thinking they were gonna screw this one up but it looks pretty good!! But still I would of liked to see Doctor Don Blake mixed in this but maybe it would be best without it! Alot of good movies coming out this summer, can&#39;t wait!! XD
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaEffing awesome!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita1:37 why didnt he say Midgard
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaDoes FUry&#39;s little yes-man actually think he can intimidate a viking storm god? Seriously, that&#39;s a good way to end up in Helheim.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@Alairic you apparently haven&#39;t read any of the comics...sure thor would beat the hulk, but he can&#39;t kill him. The madder hulk gets the stronger he gets, therefore everytime thor would hit the hulk or &quot;beat&quot; him, he would get mad at the frustration of not beating him. Then the hulk would demolish thor, bringing him to the brink of death. just look at the hulk vs. movies, thor got is assed handed to him. get your facts straight before saying thor can beat the hulk.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaSome of you nerds should be banned from commenting on anything... Ever.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitahubba hubba yum yum!!! i defintely want to see this movie!! action hot guys things blowing up!!! woot!!!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitayes!!! 3D!!! only 1 small gripe... when thor fights he&#39;s all strength, i&#39;ve never seen him throw a kick.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@galickgun666

That was actually Heimdall (a very cool character in his own right), Guardian of the Bifrost Bridge that links Midgard (Earth) to Asgard.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitawho the dude in the gold armor?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI Agree Thor should have said midgard but I read an interview where they say, they are gods! We speak there language! They dont speak our language we speak theres! Thats awesome! THOR TRAILER HAS MORE ACTION THAN BOTH IRONMAN AND INCREDIBLE HULK MOVIES COMBINED! And thats just a 2 min trailer! FUCKING AWESOME!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitabetter marvel movie ever! 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitabetter marvel movie ever!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE IT :D
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaMOVIE THOR WOULD CRUSH MOVIE HULK SO FUCKING BAD ITS NOT FUNNY! DID YOU SEE HIM FUCK UP THE LANDSCAPE? HOLY SHIT! HULK WOULD DIE MISERABLY FROM THAT STRIKE! That one scene blows away anything seen in the incredible Hulk and both Ironman movies! The scenes of the Destroyer and frost giant battles were extreme! Those little scenes blow away anything called action in those movies! This was other worldy!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@Pylver 

Yaarrrr!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@ETSUeastman515 xD
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThis should be interesting.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna be honest...I can buy Chris Hemsworth as Thor more now I&#39;ve seen the trailer than I could when he was originally announced in the role
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaOK - I&#39;m officially on board!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaOK - I&#39;m offically on board!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@renesilva93  it really is better but still...batman ftw
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaGod stop getting so butthurt about every fucking superhero movie that doesn&#39;t turn out how you want it to be. Srsly movies aren&#39;t always exactly like the comics, they are the writers and directors own artistic view on it. Honestly true fans would just laugh it off and enjoy the movie instead of being butthurt about every little fucking thing.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita2:13 oh shit!!!!! I LOVE IT
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@limecayman Kenneth Branagh is a god
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita...so basically they took Thor&#39;s story, mangled it beyond recognition, stuffed the holes with special effects, pretty actors and actresses and they are feeding it to the fans... awesome. another Marvel movie I&#39;m not gonna watch.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaYOU are Thor son of HANNIBAL!!! 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s my boy Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson)? All I want is for Volstagg to be the joyous badass he is.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@GaryFreeman1987 then why would wizard magazine (an unbiased source) rate the best comic book character of all time wolverine? superman hasn&#39;t had a good story since... ever and batman is DC&#39;s only shining star character. 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@thelonelion The Destroyer Armor.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@limecayman No I believe I was calling Natalie Portman a hack, reread my comment.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaEarth shattering trailer! I say thee hell yay!!! ;)
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so much more interesting than I was giving it credit for in the first place.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaAcross the rainbow bridge to Asgard
Where the booming heaveans roar
You&#39;ll behold in breathless wonder...
the God of Thunder- MIGHTY THOOOOOOOOR!!!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaoh my god  the movie starts playing on my birth day
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@renesilva93 no way marvelfanboy
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaso they&#39;re changing th whole story line... greeeeat.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitathat wasn&#39;t loki the guy from1:55 is
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaLoki are not black  ! u wrong galickgun666
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI wish the fanboys could get over themselves for one moment and realize that even though The Dark Knight was decent, it&#39;s also very overrated. Without Heath Ledger&#39;s admittedly brilliant performance, that movie wouldn&#39;t have been half of what it was because Christian Bale and his over done &quot;Batvoice&quot; were absolutely terrible and the story dragged. I enjoyed the movie to some extent definitely, but it&#39;s not as great as y&#39;all make it out to be. Forget Marvel and DC, just be a comic fan dammit.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitabest movie ever!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s the destroyer
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaBlack Loki FTW!!!! (I am not a racist)
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaDid Thor ask &quot;This is Earth isn&#39;t it&quot; instead of &quot;This is Midgard isn&#39;t it&quot;? Also something in Loki&#39;s design bothers me. He dosen&#39;t look like it he would be God of Misschief. 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitawho&#39;s the robot guy? ultron?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaWhen I saw Thor hitting the hammer on the ground and everything collapsed, I was like...Hulk, you&#39;re gonna get your ass kicked in The Avenger
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@renesilva93  1 million times 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitai think i just got a geekgasm.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaIs anybody else as psyched about this movie as i am? It looks really good! 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not gonna lie i thought the trailer for green lantern was much more interesting, besides I&#39;m more interested in capt A than this in the first place.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@SgtKickazz He is, and they showed him several times in the trailer. He doesn&#39;t wear the iconic horned helmet all of the time.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty awesome.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@Samakar You clearly need to go back and read some comics before you speak. Thor&#39;s backstory has always involved him being sent to earth to learn humility because he was brash and arrogant. Also, you just called Kenneth Branagh a hack...please go sit in a corner and stfu.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitathis will b summed up in one word..... lame

im a mega marvel fan but sorry this&#39;ll b poo just like the wolverine film was... 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@lamecamera It&#39;s right there at the end if you were actually paying attention. It&#39;s also been shown several other times in the longer trailers as well, but if a helmet is going to keep you from watching a movie you probably should stay home.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@scattershot1 
I think in both the myths and comic, Odin lost his eye in battle or something. Not really sure.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaooooh thanks for answering my questions everyone who came to this video. Guess I should read more Thor before opening my comment typing hands.  Still thought it looked good. Will definatley go see it! 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaLooks friggin awesome!!!!!! :D
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but there are seriously some wrong things going on here. Thor is not some whiny, bratty, arrogant teenager with some daddy issues. He also doesn&#39;t speak in a modern tongue. AND WTF IS NATALIE PORTMAN DOING IN THIS MOVIE!? STOP SHITTING ALL OVER MY FAVORITE MOVIES YOU FUCKING HACK!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty cool...
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita1:24
THAT&#39;S MAH HAMMUH.

*Search a norse in the 9th ward, then you&#39;ll understand this*
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@renesilva93 batman dark knight... i rest my case
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@SgtKickazz wasn&#39;t that him at 1:19 and 1:20? The black-haired guy who caled Odin father?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaarmors, weapons, helmets, whole backgrounds look so cheap and plastic,
like power rangers with bit higher budget than usually ;),
i&#39;m disapointed :/

JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s had one eye for as long as i can remember
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@DX3666 that&#39;s stupid
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@renesilva93 They&#39;re equal
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita2:13 what an amazing scene..... It gona be great work of Kenneth Branagh.....
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@SgtKickazz Dude he&#39;s i the trailer the whole time, you didn&#39;t see?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@scattershot1 

Odin sacrificed one eye to Mimer to gain wisdom. So no, he&#39;s not a pirate
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitathinking that loki&#39;s helmet wont appear....i wouldn&#39;t watch this movie
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitai hope loki is in this...
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita@scattershot1 odin haw a eye patch dahhh

JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaDid i just see The Destroyer armor?Shit just got real.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitamarvel is way better than dc
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshita1:33 name of the song?
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaholy shit
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitareminds me of Beowulf 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitasoooo Odin is a pirate now too?  Whats with the eye patch. 
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitalooks o.k. to me, though i wonder why he calls our world earth instead of midgard.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaNatalie Portman! &lt;3
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThis only has to have Thor talking a bit more... old like, not this modern american.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitayesssssssssssssss!

JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaOMG OMG OMG......
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaReally hyped for this! It&#39;s funny how so many others had this uploaded before Marvel.
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitanatalie portman is in it :D

btw the movie looks epic!
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaFREAKING AWESOMMEEE
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitaThey should use Triple H for Thor
JOddp-nlNvQdelimeterByIshitanice!
