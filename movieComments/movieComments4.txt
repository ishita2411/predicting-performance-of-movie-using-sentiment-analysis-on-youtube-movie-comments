2VBwLOHwio0delimeterByIshitacool
2VBwLOHwio0delimeterByIshitawhen and how?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitajust as i was getting moriarty vibes i see moriarty lol
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI hope the Spectre organization is as good as it was in the &quot; classic Bonds era &quot;. I liked how they trained  their agents and have such mean ugly women like Rosa Kleb  with poison spikes in their shoes and Irma bunt with  second in command like Largo . I hope Spectre is around more than one film I guess Im trying to say and as flamboyant as it once was.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI could be wrong, but is the blond girl in the trailer the same girl that played the French farmer&#39;s youngest daughter in the first scene of &#39;Inglourious Basterds&#39;?? Which also featured the incredible Christoph Waltz?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI really, really, really hope he doesn&#39;t write that DB10 off.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaJust take my money already!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaBond v/s Blofeld+Moriarty? Hot damn.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t I buy it RIGHT now !!!!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaRogue Nation much?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaNovember 6????<br>Fuck Star Wars 7!!!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaLooks good to me , Bond back to basics , girls , the tux the Aston Martin with Him driving it  and a good villain and a good henchman .Not since Casino Royale I saw this much action.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI really hate it when people call cars &quot;she&quot;
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitawill this be goood??
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaHey, cool. It&#39;s that one guy.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitagreat  love these movie James Bond
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshita*SQUEAL!!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait!!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIf they knock it out of the park one more time, Craig HAS to do one more movie. Too good to stop now!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaCHRISTOPHER!!.........YES!!.........he makes everything rock!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaDefinitely a must-see for every Bond fan around the world. The only main competitors for the holidays are the final &quot;Hunger Games&quot; and the return of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t Wait!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite Bond things is the Bond Music.  This trailer features a callback to one of my favorite John Barry soundtracks, On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service.  While Lazenby isn&#39;t my preferred Bond, that was a GREAT score! (one of many)
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaUm...was that Moriarty in there for half a second?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThose with a good memory will recognise the &quot;Bond going off-book and only Q is around to help him&quot; plot thread from Licence to Kill. But its a good plot theme if done properly so I don&#39;t mind that. After 24 films, every good plot line has been used of course.<br><br>And of course, you&#39;ve got hot cars (boy does that Aston look good), Bond girls (and Daniel Craig for the ladies ;) ) and a reworking of the classic John Barry OHMSS theme at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>  - what more could you possibly want?<br><br>26 October in the UK. Can&#39;t wait!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaDaniel Craig acting has always been on point, the way he is written isnt always great.Spiderman? 007 is a series that you cant just &quot;reboot&quot;, it is progressive. AND spectre has been around for a long time.......
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitasuper
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWhy do they always have to put French girls in these movies? In this case Lea Seydoux. Other countries also have pretty women!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWhy did they reveal the villains face in this trailer? They&#39;ve ruined the movie before it can even get on the screen properly!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely... CAN NOT WAIT!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIs it just me, or is Christoph Waltz channeling Peter Lorre?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaInteresting... looks interesting... subtle jab at the invisible car... still looks interesting... hm... who is the head of S.P.E.C.T.R.... HOLY FUCK I AM SO GOING TO SEE THIS ON OPENING NIGHT!!!<br><br>aherhm!...<br><br>I mean... <br><br>Interesting. ..
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaEverybody looks super old in this trailer.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer was impressive

ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI AM GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! HOPEFULLY!!!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaafter middle of thetreiler i heard the sound of Rambo theme?))))
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the music? Anyone know it?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never been a huge bond fan but,  I think this made me see how cool he is. Maybe it was the old theme playing or Craig&#39;s more slick portrayal of bond. Whatever it is I&#39;m going to see this movie.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMexico 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaoh my good, i think but not best a Casino Royal
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaNow they have rebooted Bond&#39;s canon and brought back SPECTRE and Blofeld etc. there seems NO reason why those numerous 007 films that were both original Fleming stories AND shit movies not be remade properly - Diamonds Are Forever, Live &amp; Let Die, Man WIth Golden Gun, Moonraker, Octopussy, View to A Kill, all absolute gash. Seems odd in the remake/reboot culture that Bond bucks the trend!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz is one of the few actors that can literally play any villain in a movie and can kill it. This trailer is evidence.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitathe ungadgets 007
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaEight members of SPECTRE  disliked the trailer.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThank you 007 for bringing us the hottest women in the action flick world.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to go see this :)
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitajames moriarty :D
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMexico City looks amazing! Daniel Craig the best James Bond, this is going to be brilliant.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DanielCraig">#DanielCraig</a> 4 ever
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMORIARTY 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaGreat trailer! I wish the movie will be even better than the others...<br>Not like skyfall... I fell asleep in the middle of the story due to long dialogues
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie! Also I&#39;m pretty sure at one point I heard the music from On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service. Cool little easter egg there.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaChristophe Waltz is Blofeld... That is perfect :D
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI LOVE JAMES BOND!!!! This trailer is giving me life.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIs it just me or is spectre the nazi general from inglorious basterds???
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIT WAS ME JAMES! IT WAS ME, AAAALL ALONG!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaBatista looks pretty imposing in this.  Are we finally getting proper Bond henchmen?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI was hoping that Waltz wouldn&#39;t be Blofeld, but that outfit... they pratically confirmed it. I don&#39;t like the idea of bringing him back because there&#39;s no real reason to do it. Still, i&#39;m gonna wait to see it, hoping that i&#39;m wrong and Waltz is just a new villain.<br>If it is Blofeld... what would be next? Goldfinger? I love to see the people&#39;s reactions to that.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaSpectre is going to be brilliant.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaany Batista fans here ? :)
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaBatista!!! &lt;3 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a>
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz awesome! :D
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAwesome 😈 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMoriarty in da house!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaanyone else caught a glimpse of Moriarty? (Andrew Scott)
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWell, at least they didn&#39;t ruin the surprise by revealing anything crucial to the plot.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAnd then i saw Christoph Waltz in it anddd <b>I need to fuckin watch this</b>
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAfter watching the &#39;Man from UNCLE&#39; trailer, I think Henry Cavill should be the next Bond.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThat DB10 looks awesome!!!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitajesus why this movie same thing with Fast and Furious with Supercar <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=0m34s">0:34</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=0m37s">0:37</a> and that helicopter is same The A-Team <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a> do maybe this bond 24 run out idea actually
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaChristoph Waltz :O
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaB E H O L D
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIs james brother right? Or am i wrong? Btw it looks amazing , the soundtrack the editing the cinematography, hope it tops skyfall 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIs Daniel doing another Bond after this?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshita&quot;It was me James. The author of all your pain.&quot;
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitanice.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible. The perfect fusion of classic fun Bond and the new dark, gritty and complex Bond! 007 is back!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMr. Waltz: you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI hope this is better than Skyfall
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMoriarty @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujmoYyEyDP8&amp;t=2m14s">2:14</a>
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaIs it me or is that blofeld
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWooooh!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaHELL YES!!!! I can&#39;t wait for it.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI get a feeling that this going to be a special Bond movie.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitain my opinion,the only reason to see the movie is christopher waltz. wait and see if its worth it.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAMAZING
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaJames bond hydra, i mean spectre.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaMoriarty!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaI had my doubts with this film when it was announced, but each day that goes by I look forward to it more and more. <br>I&#39;m sure that with Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig at the helm once again that this will be another classic Bond.   
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing !!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshita7
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely brilliant.
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaEXCELLENT
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaThis is going to be the best James Bond Movie to date. Also it&#39;s coming out the same day as Black Ops 3. Damnit. 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaFinally, we get to see SPECTRE in all its glory!
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaWhy couldn&#39;t Sony have treated Spider-Man with this much respect?
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaPlease god can Daniel Craig be bond forever 
ujmoYyEyDP8delimeterByIshitaawesome!!!!!!

&#39;hope Spike kept the Kaufman&#39;s spirit...

dJTU48_yghsdelimeterByIshitaIs she funny or somethingÉ
dJTU48_yghsdelimeterByIshitaHaving Scarlett Johansson NOT be on screen might be the biggest mistake they could do with this movie.

dJTU48_yghsdelimeterByIshitaSpike Jonze is awesome
dJTU48_yghsdelimeterByIshitaHe looks creepy with that mustache. 
dJTU48_yghsdelimeterByIshitaHope Joaquin will get the oscar which he deserved this year
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s good to see Hollywood still honoring our soldiers
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaWatch, just like The Walk in 2015, it&#39;ll be one of the best movies of the year and it wont get nominated for a single award
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaI think this movie won&#39;t go in the anti war direction and will be more  pro military patriotic propaganda shit
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaSpoiler Vin Diesel is acting as Sergeant Shroom....Sergeant Shroom dies in Billy&#39;s arms....I Know I&#39;m a horrible person.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLooks like pure propaganda but at least it&#39;s well shot
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaWe already saw &quot;what really happened over there&quot; when Bran went back in time with that tree guy-- Ned didn&#39;t really kill that Targaryen, someone stabbed him in the back. All the times he told that story to his children, it was a lie. I wonder what else Ned Stark was hiding?<br><br>EDIT: GoT spoiler warning
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitacoldplayyyYyy
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis promotional video comes to you sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps.<br>Join today and stfu !

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitanice!!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is really bad, it tries to set a tone, but you cant work out what tone that is.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitanominations best supporting actor &gt; Vin Diesel
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaYay &#39;Murica!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis is a comedy-drama so my guess is that the actual movie will be more of a war satire. Kind of like Mash.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaHow does Chris Tucker fit in this movie?
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshita&quot;America.. America...America&quot;... too much.. but the movie still looks great
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitawhy is this kinda of similar to flags of our father for some reason...
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThanks for ruining one of my favorite songs
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitalooked good until i saw Kristen Stewart in it, well just as long as there&#39;s plenty of killings and explosions I&#39;ll be happy
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaAmerican hero-patriot shit again
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaI was waiting for some magic Mike shit to happen
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaAnn lee, that&#39;s a guarantee!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLone Survivor trailer song
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaawsome....more American propaganda to increase the hate towards all other non American countries especially Muslim, glorify war and convince kids they be hero&#39;s and will get hot wives if they enlist. Usually a war is around the corner when so many propaganda movies are released.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitai&#39;m a simple person. i see vin diesel, i click like
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLooks like an emotional roller coaster
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitakristen stewart,nice choice. btw i love ang lee

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaa good Kristen Stewart movie?
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis has Oscar Bait written all over it.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis is going to win the Oscars in 2017, but still I need to see the trailer for Silence.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThe TriStar logo shocked me, I though they were dead
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaA Vin Diesel movie. Is in 2 seconds of the trailer

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaANG LEE.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaWhat really happened? The Globalist Bankers sent your sons and daughters to fight wars so that they can make billions and take over the countries, you are left with  PTSD when you come back and relies that you haven&#39;t been fighting for Queen and country and that it was a load of bollocks!! Hollywood recruitment film to get more souls to fight for big banks and corporation !! Don&#39;t join be a builder of your country. They let the enemy ISIS into your country by the millions!! Look a Europe right now!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaWas not expecting this to be directed by Ang Lee.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaDear America, stop encouraging War.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshita1st ID HOOAH
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitai need something like black hawk down
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaOMG! I love the song, a cover from David Bowie´s &quot;heros&quot;!!!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitathis movie is dangerously racist and needs to be banned
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaKristen Stewart is the biggest anti-American anti-military actress out there. Why in the hell is she in this movie? I will not see this movie because of that alone. She insults our military and I will not stand for that!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLove it !
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaYou already know this is going to be nominated for an Academy award. The music alone is an indicator lol.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaChoral version of classic song?.Check.The Social network did that, and way better, 5 yrs ago.This film was clearly designed to win Oscars.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaTrump fans will love this....
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaGreat!! It&#39;s about time that Americans won&#39;t feel guilty for the hate of the arabs. Don&#39;t be stupid liberal.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaDid you see the message this is trying to pass on?!? <br>No!! it is NOT SEXY to go and explode another country for whatever reason! <br>Oil / god / power / being a part of a bigger picture / being a &quot;&quot;hero&quot;&quot; / kill terrorists (even if you were invading their country long before) / trying to do like daddy :/ make somebody proud / ...<br>War IS NOT COOL<br>IS NOT SEXY<br>IS NOT POWERFUL <br>IS A BIG BAD MESS <br><br><br>HATE THOSE KINDS OF MOVIES! F***!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaso sad this country has become a country of cowards who doesn&#39;t want to fight for there people anymore and Hollywood is always trying to scared and make you feel bad for our warriors who fight with there head high God bless our warriors and the United States of America
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaToday we call a person who Invades a country a hero...and the one who defends there own lad from those who invade it a terrorist
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitalooked good until I saw vin and bella
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaSong ?

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaI need to see this movie, it looks real and very sad at times
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLife is not fair, certainly when you are hiding !!!
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaok so its one of those movies again
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaVin Diesels character is probably going to die by a sniper in the combat scene.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitawow, holy shit i didn´t expect this to be directed by ang lee.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitagonna wait for this to be on netflix
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get where this movie going. It goes from happy place to scary place, not sad place to scary place. Ik this is a feelings movie but how can one relate to a person who is being honored at a freaking parade?
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaAng Lee what are you doing wasting your takent
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaVietnam Flashbacks - The Movie
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaactress shit

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t interested, but then I saw Ang Lee
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitavery looking forward to this
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaThis better have a deeper meaning to it than the trailer provides.
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitaLooks like shit

mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshita😭😭😍😍🙌🏽🙌🏽
mUULFJ_I048delimeterByIshitanot a good movie
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaMy new job.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaFUCK I can&#39;t wait for this!!!!!! 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI expected another X-Men movie but instead got something that seems to be better.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was expecting something x-men yeah yeah this look great bla bla bla I freaking wanted x-men&#39;s nightcrawler alright.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal for next Joker? Whose with me?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing. Oscar Nominations all around. 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaAmo este trailer ♥ Se nota que va a ser una gran película &amp; excelente actuación de <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JakeGyllenhaal">#JakeGyllenhaal</a>, quiero verla! 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaIf DC is ever looking for a new guy to play The Joker, Jake Gyllenhaal is THE guy!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitalooks good
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaHe actually looks like Nightcrawler though. Gyllenhaal for Nightcrawler Movie!!!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitathis is some crazy shit and i fuckin love it
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaName of the song ?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaGetting DeNiro circa The King of Comedy vibes from Gyllenhaal.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI like the title, too bad it&#39;s also a comic book&#39;s character name
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaFeel like they should change the name of the movie to something else. Honestly thought it was an x men movie, and Jake seems like he would be a pretty good nightcrawler so that made it worse lol
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaHoly Fucking Shit, this is fucking cinema.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was going to be about the teleporter from the x-men 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaFinally he makes a new movie that looks decent
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThat looks amazing
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fantastic. Gyllenhaal seems to have found his inner psycho. <br>What I gathered is that his character is so desperate for a job/attention, that he fabricates the scenes of crime for good television. <br>I will go see this.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaMan!!! This movie looks great!!!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;ll probably get nominated for this one.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaalin ass in the sexy beast of a car!!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaGreat looking movie! I&#39;ve never seen a movie with a concept like this..
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting and very on point!<br>I hope jake Gyllenhaal will get praise and credits for his acting in this.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI smell Os...(Coughs...sorry something in my throat..Lets start again...I smell Oscar nominee 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m always up for a movie that has cops being killed
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThe Movie looks pretty cool and all, but did they call it &#39;Nightcrawler&#39; just to fool nerds into thinking it&#39;s an Xmen movie? That was a bait and switch I didn&#39;t need.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaCant be the only one that thought this would be X-Mens Nightcrawler right &gt;_&gt;
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaReporters and the media have become dangerous tools for the excitement hungry public. Our need for entertainment rather than our desire for truth for defines what is published and as such reporters go to extreme levels, many times invading privacy and violating the law
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaAll lies, I can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m still gonna watch it though.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitawhen I read the title I thought at first the movie was about marvel&#39;s nightcrawler 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI think its new marvel movie. :C
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal looks like a BAMF in this movie.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was sceptical when I saw the teaser but damn! This looks promising. I like the concept now let&#39;s hope the execution is as good
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaSeriously Nightcrawler was not a word made up by marvel. it was just made famous from marvel
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLike if you thought this was gonna be about nightcrawler from xmen
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal needs to do the remake of Scarface...
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI have been misled.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaBREAKING NEWS- THIS MOVIE ISNT ABOUT SOME LAME X MEN CHARACTER, IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A GOOD MOVIE WITH GREAT ACTING, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCRIPT.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who clicked this video not expecting night crawler from x men... Movie looks fucking great and calm down x men fans u just had a movie I&#39;m sure you will get one sooner than later with night crawler, seeing as franchises r getting a billion movies such as marvel (disney), dc, Spider-Man (Sony), hell even Star Wars is going to have a Han Solo or boba fett movie so just enjoy what appears to be an awesome movie :)
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaNiceeee, high hopes for jake gylenslkhwcniu
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks refreshing, always love whatever Jake Gyllenhaal is in, this almost gives off a vibe similar to Donnie Darko, looks like it could get very dark at times..
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks crazy as fuck.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like to see actors become so skinny..
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaFuck nightcrawler from x men this movie looks good
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was like: yay a nightcrawler movie but nope it was something else
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaRizzy sounds like a stoner
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaX men Origins: Nightcrawler.... Aww I guess not...
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI thought my most loved mutant was getting a movie :( 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaAlex Turner! is that you?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThe one actor looks like Hal from ScreenJunkies.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWell this ad was much more effective then the last.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaDang it I thought it was the actual night crawler from X-men 😢😡😣😭
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaGotta love how these kids think this will flop just because their little comic book hero isn&#39;t in it 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshita垃圾好莱坞电影
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaShyt, I clicked on link thinking it was a X-Men movie. I was like where&#39;s Allen and why they showing Jake. 😥👎
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThere goes the simple title for a marvel Nightcrawler movie lol
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWhy no Kurt Wagner?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know who the Night Crawler superhero is, and this looks like it might be a good movie...
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaYea I also thought that it was going to be another X- Men movie. 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJetta - I&#39;d Love To Change The World (Ninja Tracks Remix)
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitawhere the hell is NIGHT Crawler!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE JAKE G <br><br>-everyone 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was bummed at first that it wasn&#39;t about the superhero but after watching the whole trailer I&#39;m actually quite excited to see this movie :D
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis is just a comment saying that this movies looks interesting, and not one whining about the name acting like thousands of people haven&#39;t already mentioned it...
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaClicked on this thinking &quot;I don&#39;t think Jake Gyllenhaal is French enough for this part.&quot;
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitahuh thought this was an X-men spin off. Oh well, looks good.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaJust stop biching about the title you idiots it looks like a good movie 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaMust watch
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWTF, why do people complain about the movie title? seriously, that&#39;s not important.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaMusic?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was totally expecting another X-men movie...
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshita@ShawnBurnes2 You&#39;re right.  This movie will fail because some kid in middle America clicked on a YouTube video before understanding what the video was and then got angry because he didn&#39;t get what he wanted.  You&#39;re right, the movie viewing public won&#39;t be able to figure it out in time.  There&#39;s no way releasing multiple movie trailers, posters and a multimillion dollar advertising budget could let people know what this movie is about.  Jesus what an idiot!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWhy is everyone complaining about the name of this movie are people really so stupid that it confuses them. Nightcrawler was term used before xmen jesus grow up.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaYOU TRICKED ME TRAILER
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaFinally an original idea from Hollywood,  looks promising. 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWe got it! It&#39;s not a superhero! Thank god.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome! First movie I&#39;ve wanted to see in a long while 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty interesting
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI kept waiting for some superhero turn. But I never got it cuz this isn&#39;t a marvel movie. :(
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s not the night-crawler i was thinking of. i was expecting super powered but i guess a film maker wanting to get his head blown off is cool too.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooking at the other trailers I had the plot mapped out completely different in my head. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stilllooksgreatthough">#stilllooksgreatthough</a>
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWow the Prince of Persia guy got skinny
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitabooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaWhat a shame.....the movie will fail cause they titled a movie a superhero&#39;s name during the superhero era of movies....bad call.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to watch this movie you have to make the money to buy a ticket.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna be crazy good !!!!!!!!!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaAt first I was expecting an &quot;x-men&quot; night crawler movie which would be awesome, then looking at the trailer meh 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaSeriously WTF!!! I want to punch whoever made this in the face (not movieclips) because the people who made this new that nightcrawler was a marvel x-men hero
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitacould be his next best role! 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitasong?
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaHot!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI was deceived. Thought it was going to be about X-Men Nightcrawler
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks absolutely brilliant. 
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks stellar!
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaI got exited for second then I realised it wasn&#39;t the nightcrawler I was thinking of 😢
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good.
X8kYDQan8bwdelimeterByIshitahmmm... something new story plot..!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaKoba is going to be a trouble in this movie too.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitathat is frightening.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitalooks great!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitacaeser has his kid in this movie? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSaTrW4leg&amp;t=0m47s">0:47</a> mark
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitawhy cant this movie be in IMAX 3D?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI knew Koba was gonna be trouble even in the first movie. This looks like it will easily be one of the best movies of the summer. With all of the action movies that are pumped out each year, this franchise is really set on a great course.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI was like OMGrrrrod!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitathats so epic... im going to see it in cinema
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThey sure show a lot...again!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaale hujnia
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaVery good story-telling trailer. The music is &quot;Where It Ends&quot; by Superhuman (Pusher Music). :)
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaCaesar seems to be a type of Robert E. Lee now. 
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaCaesar talks like Christian Bale&#39;s Batman. Is he going to be Batape soon?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most anticipated films of the year!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis looks uber epic !!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWho makes the voice for Caesar? Christian Bale? rs
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaHoly Sh*t....That Movie has to be great!<br>Takeallmymoney.jpg
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSaTrW4leg&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a> ?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaDespite knowing the beginning and the ending. This movie is gonna be one hell of an emotional ride. I just hope I don&#39;t cry.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaawesome cgi thru out the trailer except the last scene wen ceaser jumps . that one was pretty amateurish.. 
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaScene at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSaTrW4leg&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> reminds me of the famous video &quot;Chimp with AK-47&quot;
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer shows the right amount from the movie
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaHope they touch up the CGI before they release it.....
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care about Hobbit and Spider-Man, this will be the movie of the year. EPIC AS HELL!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so good!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI dont know about this?! The first trailer made me believe that the movie was good but now this ...
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ, the special effects and motion capture work is some of the best I&#39;ve seen, incredible
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI think Koba will mentor and recruit River into his army and force Caesar to fight him. Then either River gets killed by humans or Koba kills him himself (Ape Not Kill Ape) and Caesar will kill Koba. I think maybe Cornelia and the little one get killed, which drives River to join Koba and eventually because of all of the bloodshed Caesar will feel no choice but to enslave the world in order to find peace. BAM! Let me know what you think :)
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaGood trailer<br><br>My only complaint is that it spoiled the story.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaBrb, just nerdgasmed all over myself.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!  Although we know who actually wins the war in the end!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaSOLD SOLD SOLD!!!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitadeath to the human scum!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaEvery blockbuster has a collapsing radio tower, is that the thing now?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI thought Caesar was the only one who can talk but I didn&#39;t Koba to talk too
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWow... wonder if happens like this.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m scared Maurice is going to die by the hands of Koba; and this trailer just makes me think it even more especially when Koba seems to defy Ceasers leadership.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI remember not too long ago that anything depicting a falling building was considered &quot;insensitive&quot; or &quot;in poor taste&quot;. Jump a few years later, and now every movie&#39;s got one!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaBLOOD PUMPING! CHILLING! STUNNING! AMAZING!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThe movie of the summer that&#39;s going to make me cry is this, i just know it
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazingly epic!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshita2 humans disliked the video
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitawho doesn&#39;t want to see an ape riding on a horse while shooting with 2 guns?
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshita2 people like twilight...
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaOmg Can&#39;t Wait To See This!! Andy.S. is the most amazing Actor Director I have seen .. Just Amazing .thank u.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaso the next ones gonna be &#39;&#39; poop of the planet of the dawn of the rise rise of the of the of the planet of the apes&#39;&#39; :D
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI knew Koba was gonna be a Problem!!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitase ve buena una película mas que espero con ansias
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitayes.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaPeople it&#39;s really obvious that they just spoiled the movie in this video because just proved how predictable the movie will be. Guy tries to find peace with the apes and humans. Ape leader wants the same. Tries to prove it&#39;s possible. Apes friend hates humans. Kills humans to make apes look bad. Humans find out apes killed some guys. War begins all chances ruined and apes win. I was hoping it wouldn&#39;t be that predictable but from this trailer alone that&#39;s where it&#39;s leading to. 
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI hope I get a chance to see this movie before my third orthopedic surgery.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshita CAN&#39;T WAIT!!!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis sequel might be better than the first movie. It would change Reality.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI never thought that I would see the image of a chimpanzee riding a horse dual wielding machine guns..... I CAN&#39;T WAIT!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI thought the part of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpSaTrW4leg&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a> was going to provide from comedy relief but when Koba shot the first guy, I almost jumped out my chair.  
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitai just jizz in my pants!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaLmfao I fuckin died! The ape had two M4s blasting while ridding a horse! Thug lyfe
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI got goosebumps when Caesar said &quot;A good man, like you.&quot;
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWow! This trailer was a-freaking-mazing! This basically further set the tone of the movie and I like how it kinda shows how the war will begin and towards the end of the trailer it shows how it will end also I think there will be 2 showdowns at the end 1. Caesar and Gary Oldman&#39;s character Dreyfus and 2. Caesar (again I know) and Koba but I think more than likely Oldman&#39;s character might die before he gets to Caesar either by apes or Malcolm who looks to be on the apes side then Koba may try to kill Malcolm witch will make him and Caesar fight all in all I&#39;m super excited to see this! Trailers looked great! The action looks great! I can&#39;t wait to see if my ending predictions come true or not but in the end the apes will Be the last species standing!...in the movie only of course lol
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaREFRIGERATION!!!!!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWhen an animal becomes intelligent it will will need power, electricity &amp; heat..
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaif you&#39;re complaining about spoilers to a Planet of the Apes prequel I ain&#39;t got nothin for you.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, just wish they&#39;d hold back on all the big reveals. Trailer shows way too much. 
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis is like...beyond epic!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaso excited man!!!!!!! saw all the originals even Tim Burtons. i love what they have done and i&#39;m going to watch the hell out of this when it comes out.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s never a good sign when a trailer practically shows the whole film.... just sayin&#39;
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis was a great final trailer.<br>This is the film of the summer!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI hope koba die&#39;s at the end of the movie. I hope That B*tch Koba will Die I hope.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t like Koba ever since he tried to kill Caesar&#39;s father (James Franco)
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaKoba is my favorite character. Even in Rise he was a badass!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaDoes it com out July 11th or 14th
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaWoah, really wasn&#39;t expecting for Koba to be able to speak, cool!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaOutstanding, I can&#39;t wait for it to come out next month!!!! I want to see Apes now!!! Everyone of the films are fantastic(Except Tim Burton&#39;s)!
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaBest trailer I&#39;ve seen in years. This is going to be epic, already looks like a classic.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitawell the apes now can ride horse and use machine guns both hand while riding horse. We&#39;re fucked <del>_</del> 
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaI wish they didnt make this trailer. They did well with the first 2 not showing important things and giving you a tease. This basically told the movie in less than 3 minutes.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshita<br>Ah<br> ma<br>  Lerd.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitabazinga
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to make the new Godzilla look like a 2nd rate poopfest.

DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be soooo good. Literally got goosebumps from watching this.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaSo Koba starts the war? <br>Should&#39;ve kept that secret.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaHoly Hell, I am so pumped for this movie.
DpSaTrW4legdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! I already know the whole plot just from this trailer! Cool!

6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAbFYbi8XU&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a> Jessica Chastain or Lana Del Rey
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWhat year is this movie set in?
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAbFYbi8XU&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a> <b>faints</b> Seriously, though this looks soooooooooo good! Always loved Del Toro&#39;s, both Hellboy (especially the sequel) and Pan&#39;s Labyrinth, although they were completely different, were stunning and creative. Look forward!
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaour own LOKI
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaThat flute reminded me so much of Alien.
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/6yAbFYbi8XU?t=2m08s">2:08</a> tho
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitathis isnt even scary, so colorful, its like a fantasy adventure, alice in wonderland/ wizard of oz type flick
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaLive action Beauty and the Beast with Hiddleston cast as the beast and Chris Helmsworth cast as Gaston- who&#39;s on board? 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a scared little girl when it comes to horror movies. I hate &#39;em! But Charlie Hunnam is in it and I kinda love everything about him lol. Sigh I might have to woman up to see him in it ☺
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaGuillermo del Toro + Tom Hiddleston + Jessica Chastain? I&#39;m SO in.
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for Tom ! 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another movie where she has no common sense
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaomg this movie is gonna be so awesome. and tom is a hottie
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaI hope this movie could scare me .. in recent years, there was only &quot;Woman in Black&quot; make me really scared .. !!
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaThe song is from the score of Aronofsky&#39;s Noah, it was used perfectly
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitawow not only does this look like a good horror movie but it looks absolutely beautiful!!!
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaLoki brought me here
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAbFYbi8XU&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a> Hello... My body is ready. Holy hell that man has it all! Talent, looks, intelligence... I can&#39;t wait to see this film! 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaGuillermo del Toro &lt;3
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitana na na na na ghost busters
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaThey always take the elevator to the lower level...Rose did it on Titanic,  Ariande did it on Inception, now this girl is doing it on Crimson Peak.  I wonder if she&#39;ll find Leonardo down there too LOL
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWow Alice has grown so much :))
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWhy is loki in this movie lol
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaTom just killed me with his hotness 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitadamn im really afraid of scary movie but Tom is in it so...and he looks freaking hot here gotta watch it
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaI think I just passed out 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitathat isnt scary or horror
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaanother shitty horror movie
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWhy does Tom Hiddleston must have that haircut? He looks like loki now 
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaSo that explains why Loki wasn&quot;t present in AOU events , he was masquerading as someone else .  
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of the movie NADUNISI NAAIGAL..... :-D
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAbFYbi8XU&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a> Jax you lad

6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks really good! Love the cinematography and the music.
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWait its this movie based novel by Stephen King?
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitawhen Stephen king thinks a horror movie is good...you don&#39;t need to see reviews on whether or not you should see it
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yAbFYbi8XU&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a> ... 2 seconds which convince me to watch this movie ;) And the rest looks also amazing
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely a must see, this looks so creepy and intense.
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Alice, this is my sister, Murph.&quot; - Loki
6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaWhen bae is in a film you don&#39;t want to watch 😢

6yAbFYbi8XUdelimeterByIshitaSilent Hill Would Have been awesome!!! F U Konami!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I get one of those bathtubs?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaNow, this is what you call a trailer! No giveaways of what the main plot would be...
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks like is going to suck.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaNow that was a trailer!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaLooks stupid, for some I can&#39;t George Clooney seriously as an actor ever since Batman and Robin. Is it just me or does he suck at acting?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaAll you haters stop hating on this movie, its for kids ok..... sorry its not like &quot;game of thrones&quot; and &quot;death note&quot; with a thousand subplots... its simple and for kids
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWhat do you get when you cross The Wizard Of OZ, Alice In Wonderland, and Doctor Who?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI really like the whole retro-futuristic look they are going for.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s awesome... but really nonsense!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitano &quot;if Christianity didn&#39;t exist&quot; jokes? what happened people ...
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaHope its good, although i seem to related it to jupiter ascending...what do you think? should this one be better? Or am I just talking for talking
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaim 19 and i really want to see this...thats ok right? like...normal i mean
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaHugh Laurie, I see you! Way too excited for this movie now!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis is like an amazing dream come true. In a literal sense because the movie looks so imaginative.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaYES. YES YES YES.<br>Brad Bird is a national treasure.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaSatanic witch craft.!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThe fist trailer did not impress me. This however shows an awesome movie I want to watch. 
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaSo its promoting hallucinogens to kids?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWoah wth just happened! well that hit me
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaBrad Bird is like the King Midas of directors. Everything he touches turns to gold. <br><br>M.Night Shamalan is like the Medusa of directors. Everything he looks turns to stone.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaDisney&#39;s Toshitterland
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaStupid and racist, but I&#39;m sure it will be great propaganda!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaAfter the third trailer, I still have no clue what this movie is about, but I want to watch.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaOkay , that looked confusing.....
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI see space mountain made it in! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNzukD8pS_s&amp;t=2m16s">2:16</a>
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaLooks purty cool.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaSo Tomorrowland resides in a parallel universe.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaDamn!  Didn&#39;t expect that.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis is a DISNEY movie?! Wow.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaA.K.A New World Order
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaA Michael Bay Disney movie
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaFight for tomorrow, today, because yesterday will be too late!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaDirected by Micheal Bay.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWith every new trailer my heart beats faster..... I become restless!!! George clooney &#39;in action&#39;.... God! And then there&#39; s hugh laurie - damn it
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshita<i>I like the concept of this movie, too bad it is not the sequel of the sequel of the sequel of a recycled concept.</i>
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaUnfortunately, I&#39;m getting strong John Carter vibes here.  A Pixar genius making an overstuffed, CGI-heavy, live-action &quot;epic&quot; loosely based on an existing property.<br><br>It&#39;s okay (even ideal) for a trailer to be mysterious and hold back plot information. But this is just...confusing. And muddled. At first it seems like a coming-of-age fantasy like Wizard of Oz. Then it looks like a generic sci-fi thriller. Seems both campy...and serious. <b>shrug</b>
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaLooks neat.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks freakin Amazing
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitanow i will go and see this movie
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNzukD8pS_s&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a> Why would the shutters close one by one instead of simultaneously? Cinema Sins will have a great time with this.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaOMG! That&#39;s Awesome!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis is one Disney Movie worth watching at IMAX.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI will give this a miss. It seems too much like old Hollywood, not diverse or representative. There is a big reason why Furious 7 made a billion worldwide, diversity.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Skrillex?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe nobody has yet commented (as far as I checked) about how the future in here looks like the future in the Meet The Robinsons! <br><br>Doesn&#39;t matter, Keep Moving Forward :D
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitathis is their best trailer yet... no duh!!  I can&#39;t wait to see the movie and see Britt Robertson and George working together!!  She is brilliant and he ain&#39;t bad.. LOL  (PS my best are Dave and Aubrey)
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaTerminator meets SpyKids meets Jimmy Neutron... Looks good!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI was already sold on the little teaser.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitalooks futuristic
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaGod, YES
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m beginning to get excited to see this movie. It looks pretty awesome!  
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else find the part at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNzukD8pS_s&amp;t=0m57s">0:57</a> really awkward?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis, ladies and gentlemen, is a peek into the Astral Realm. If you&#39;re not familiar, I suggest you Google &quot;Astral Realm&quot;. It may change the way you view reality.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI cannot wait to see this!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaTake my money now, Disney! Looks like it will be a Disney summer.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThe Matrix + Willy Wonka = Tomorrowland?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitathis does not tell me anything at all about the movie... what the heck is the plot? (and yea read the bloody description, that isn&#39;t an answer)
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWait, was that House?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWould rather visit Tomorrowland in belgium xD
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone think this kinda is like the giver?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThe opening cityscape looks a bit like from Perry Rhodan: The Immortals of Terra. It looks great!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaBrad Bird.... Can&#39;t go wrong with him now can you?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaHell yeah! Another trailer featuring Thomas Bergersen&#39;s brilliant music. (Thomas Bergersen - Creation of Earth)
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitawow...looks pretty darn good
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaYES!!!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNzukD8pS_s&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a><br>A rocket tub that flies?<br>Yep..............gotta love gmod
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis great, every time it gets more interesting .You wanted to see Tomorrowland, here you have it?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaokay, now i can&#39;t wait to watch this movie :) countdown begins next 30 days :D happy tomorrowland :D
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaAAHHHH SO MANY TRAILERS THIS WEEK
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaisnt that skyline in the first few seconds from the game brink?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI got pretty interested. I love the fact that the same guy that made something like The Incredibles for example, is doing this. This may be quite awesome.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWould love to see this movie inspire the remodel of Tomorrowland at Disneyland.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWhat? This is more like a clip of a single scene than a trailer.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaDisney needs to built Tomorrowland the Ride! They could put it in Adventureland.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThey should of had me in the movie instead of Clooney.  I was in Full House for crying out loud.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaMust watch this!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaPooooortal!!!  &lt;3
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaFor the love of fuck, don&#39;t get your hopes up! Damon Lindelof helped write this.
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaawesome
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaI am so curious about hugh laurie&#39;s role...
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWhat a year for Disney, <br>Cinderella<br>Age of ultron<br>Tommorrowland <br>Inside out<br>Ant-man<br>The good dinosaur<br>And...<br>STAR WARS: EPISODE 7<br>THE FORCE AWAKENS!<br>That&#39;s makin money Disney!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaif Aperture Science Technologies got out. <br><br>and an old man from crappy 90s movies had to protect those technologies. <br><br>and he carried around a teenage girl around for some no good reason . <br><br>that would be this movie
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaHugh Laurie I saw you!!!!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThis is PG?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me, or is this trailer one of the best out of the ones we have got recently?
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaBrad Bird is directing ? Count me in
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaGetting some serious Terminator vibes here...
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaholy shit!! This looks AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitawow!!!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaWOW, holy crap! Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader now works on the Dolphin emulator!!!!!! Oh and I&#39;m still not watching this...
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaOMG! Beautiful
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaMan, this looks awesome!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s so many cool movies coming out this year. It&#39;s crazy!
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaTomorrowland more like TomorrowGOAT
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaYESSSS
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaMy hat is off to you Brad Bird
lNzukD8pS_sdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaRemember when me and my cousin smoke a weed and see the movie dam i never laugh that hard in a theatre 😂😂
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThis badly needs a sequel, same actors, no remake bullshit
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaFirst time watching the trailer glad my uncle took me to see this when I was 10 tho
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaIs this what getting the people all riled up in arms about? Pathetic.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaBest Quotes...<br><br>Ben Stiller - Who Left The Fridge Open?<br><br>Robert Downey Jr. - I Know Who I Am!!! I&#39;m A Dude Playing A Dude Disguised As Another Dude!<br><br>Jack Black - WHAT IS GOING ON HERE???!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitathe guy says ‘走吧。’ which means ‘let’s go’ and the image on the screen says ‘KiLl tHeM aLl’ dear god the subtitles are gold
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaOne of the black guys looks kinda like Robert Downey&#39;s Jr
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaShaft
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitai loveeee this movie
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSeeing this movie a decade later, <br>such a disappointment that it wasn’t nominated as either Best Picture or Best Original Screenplay 😒
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaDid the creators really think Ben Stiller&#39;s name would help sell this movie?  I wish Siskel and Ebert were still around to review this one.  I thought the movie appealed to the lowest common denominator. I appreciate a good comedy but the actors felt like they were trying way too hard to be funny. The movie is definitely not something I will go back and watch, and certainly not a classic or will it ever fit into the category of becoming a cult classic.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaJoe Rogan brought me here
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaJoe Rogan 2020!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaLmao just wait till 2040 they will call this movie problematic
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s here after the Joe Rogan experience with Robert Downey Jr. ?
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThis was the Jumanji prequel
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaClassic 🤣
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is littered with amazing actors. It had tom cruise, danny McBride, matthew McConaughey, and bill Hader too.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThey no longer make movies like these
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone here after Rajkumar Rao interview or Tried &amp; Refused production video ?
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie works ok so many levels. Downey and Cruise were the highlight.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThe Best two things in the film are Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, both absent from the trailer.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaToronto, Real Madrid, Seattle Sounders, Atlanta United, Chicago Fire
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know that tom and iron man were in this years after i seen movie xD
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl4JNnqNaE&amp;t=1m31s">1:31</a> what is joker doing here ?
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS FLAMING DRAGON
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitajust finished watching the movie! can&#39;t believe he did this after doing iron man hahahaha
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaHe is Robert Downey Jr playing Tony Stark disguised as Iron Man
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitalet me guess Alex, Po and Stark went to war in South Asia. Lol
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaI’m surprised RDJ hasn’t received much heat for Blackface... oh but I feel it’s coming. But after iron man, what damage can they really do to him lol
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita2008 RDJ : <b>love ya 3000 muthafuka</b>
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaStill madd funny til this day.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaIm here because of RDJ memes in marvel fanpage.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita<b>Whattis going on herre?!</b> xD
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated film. Would like to point out that Matthew McConaughey played a good supporting role in this and that was before he got his groove back as a leading man.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaBefore Tony became iron man.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitarobert downey jr is very good at being a black man
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitabrandon soohoo should played iron fist
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaLove You 3000
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita&quot;some of us might not make it back &quot;...&quot;what do you mean,  like not on the same flight ...&quot;  LMAO ...been over 10 yrs now...officially cult classic status...
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitawhen i was a kid i never realised it was iron man i taught it was an actual black dude
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitathis is the dumbest movie ever and i mean that as a good thing cuz its funny as hell lol
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaDowney Jr reminds me of a younger Dracula from Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy 😂
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaOmg this movie is such a good movie can’t wait for the other movie to come out bet it won’t top this Movie this movie was the best movie ever
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita:(
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaWatching this right now coincidentally on its 10th anniversary.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaRDJ character is hilarious!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaTrump has to understand that America is not how he wants it!!!! He has to learn to love variety!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaRobert Downey Jr thoo!  Black American and Australian actor! Love the accents!!!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitagreat movie....seen it a few times...watched it again last night
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaA quick question. The movie they are filming in Tropic Thunder resembles another movie. At the beginning, Ben Stiller is being shot from behind. He is the last one coming but the soldiers get him. There was another movie I think also about Vietnam and at the end of the movie, this one guy also doesn&#39;t make it, just like Ben Stiller at the beginning of Tropic Thunder. And this guy was kind of a trouble maker in the group, very short hair and kind of round head if I remember correctly. In short, he gets shot exactly like Ben Stiller does at the beginning of Tropic Thunder. Anyone has any idea what movie it is?
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaHow did they made RD Jr black ! hehehee
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of those movies that just gets better every time I watch it.  I would love to see a Kirk Lazarus/Lincoln Osiris spinoff at some point.  I doubt we ever will, but I can&#39;t get enough of that character.  So many quotable, absolutely laugh out loud moments.  Even when you know what&#39;s coming it still makes you laugh.  One of my favorite scenes is when Linc says, &quot;Yo asshole! This muthafucka&#39;s dead. Ain&#39;t no Chris Angel Mindfreak, David Blane trapdoor horse shit jumpin&#39; off here! &quot;.  That is some funny shit right there.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaTried watching this once, couldn&#39;t make it all the way through. I guess i found it too dumb. I also didn&#39;t know until much later that the black guy is RDJ
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitai have watched this movie over 70 times during 3 months in the past, i knew all the lines by heart, this is my favourite comedy movie of all time. &lt;3
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaNot a lot of people talk about Danny McBride and Nick Nolte in the movie, they both are so underrated in the movie and have great chemistry.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSo if Four Leaf never really lost his arms...does that mean Aron Ralston didn&#39;t really cut his arm off from the boulder?
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl4JNnqNaE&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> I cannot stop laughing XD
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m triggered
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSo Iron Man is an nigga... Yeah!
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSo ahead of its time

9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie. Yet this is the first time i watch this trailer. You see all it took for me to watch this was seeing iron man playing a black guy. Great movie.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSuch a great movie 
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer is absolutely aweful but the movie itself wasn&#39;t that bad. Not bad at all.
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaSo there will be Jet and Air Support<br>Cool
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaFather, is a nature.  A word, is seen in print, or heard.  And a spirit is invisible.<br>It is written that The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost are one.  See, King James Version.<br>That said, when one speaks of visible things, one is speaking of visible things..<br>&quot;I&#39;m the dude..&quot;
9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie !

9Pl4JNnqNaEdelimeterByIshita&quot;What do you mean &#39;you&#39; people?&quot;
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitamy school is a big part of this movie
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s amazing what the press can do, even expose the truth or distract us from the truth.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaMy boyfriend goes the the high school which a large part of the article was based on. The school administrators are understandably pissed that this is happening but all the students think it&#39;s great!!! It happened in the past but they&#39;re in love with the idea of the school finally getting fucked.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaHey its that dude from CSI...
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAnti Catholic bs
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI admire that the newspaper had the courage to stand up to the awesome might of the Catholic Church, and admire the courage of the people who made this movie.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWELL, I guess I&#39;ll have to hate-watch this. Really though, massive kudos to that Boston Globe team and kudos to the team making this movie, reminding everybody not to forget.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhy I suddenly wish Phillip Seymour Hoffman was still alive, joining those cast and continue making good movies even better.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshita:)
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThis is winning Best Picture.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitawow fuck this
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks boring.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI hope these actors are being payed well for making the only Church that can lead People to salvation look horrible with all this over inflated distortion of what really happened. Sure there are bad apples in every faith  anyone with common sense won&#39;t dispose of a bushel of apples for a few bad ones. People don&#39;t leave Peter because of Judas, you&#39;ll be leaving the only source for salvation Jesus left us on earth.  I hope the Church sues the Poop out whoever funded this diabolically inspired movie.

EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitadamn, when did Roger leave Sterling&amp;Cooper ??
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaKeaton, ruffalo nominated for oscars again please. And Rachel McAdams nominated for one as well.<br>Ruffalo was great in Foxcatcher it&#39;s a shame he was up against JK Simmons in Whiplash
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaBatman, the hulk, Sabretooth, Irene Adler, Dr. Erskine, Sweeney Todd and doctor Manhattan
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAs a Journalism student, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwdCIpbTN5g&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> gives me such a boner.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitadamn this looks good
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThis one has Academy Awards written all over it ..!!! I predict several nominations
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitanever seen a more white cast in my life....geeez
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThe church took advantage of me when I was younger.  I am so happy to watch this movie.  It will motivate me to help many people out there.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaOscar contenders. Rachel Mcadam Mark Ruffalo and all the cast lol
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaMark Ruffalo is such a gifted actor, its insane
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaForget oscars and awards. This STORY, simply by itself, is a breakthrough investigation story. It shocked the world. That&#39;s more than a single gold statue could ever do. Forget the superheroes, these journalists have the makings of true heroes.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThe song is Dear God by Lawless feat. sydney wayser.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams soon to be Academy Award nominee, I believe!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaSome serious money in the bank for the UK&#39;s greatest (virtually) unknown songwriter - Andy Partridge. About time too.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitathey better get the sag nomination for best cast
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitawanna this movie so bad
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaSeems amazing!<br>And what&#39;s the trailer&#39;s music?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitamichael is great actor/ilove birdman
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitatake my money! ruffalo is so good. keaton. ahhh
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshita&quot;It could&#39;ve been you, it could&#39;ve been me it could&#39;ve been any of us&quot;.<br><br>The horrible true...
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAbout time something like this came out! :D So watching ;)
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaYay! Micheal Keaton&#39;s back printing the news!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like 13 Catholic priests don&#39;t like this trailer lol...
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaSupporting Actor this year will be Hardy vs Elba vs Keaton. Legit 3 way race. Should be fun.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaDamn talk about a good year for Rachel McAdams
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, can&#39;t wait to see it.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like very much Mark Ruffalo as an actor... but, this time, he surprised me!<br>Micheal Keaton, Stanley Tucci!<br>The trailer is very good!<br>Wating for this film!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who noticed the &quot;dear god&quot; cover soundtrack? beautiful!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaSo glad to see Michael Keaton back. The younger generation needs to see his older movies to get an appreciation for what a great comedic actor he was &amp; how great comedic actors are great actors period, in dramatic roles or action, suspense whatever. He has great range &amp; has been in some awesome movies with other great actors. Like Tom Hanks he started off being in comedies than branched out. He did Night Shift, Mr.Mom &amp; then Batman &amp; a ton of others with equally talented co-stars. I just love him as an actor. It is time he got some recognition for being so talented.,
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAs a devout Catholic and a movie fan I&#39;m interested to see this movie
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI love how the past 2 times I saw this trailer in the Bible Belt everyone around me was complaining.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaTerrific cast and true story.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song playing in the background
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m from the Boston area. I can tell you that growing up, this was quite a racket for my classmates. You mad a false claim, the Church would be embarrassed into settlement. The money is the incentive.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWow looks amazing can&#39;t wait
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaReligion should be taken out of power in the U.S. And global wide.<br>&quot; George Washington &quot;<br><br>Christians must die for Rome to live<br>&quot;  Roman Emperor Nero Caesar &quot;   <br><br>
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks great ! I will be going to see this for sure. Hope one of your fine actors will see my new ground breaking Documentary called The 13th Step that Exposes sexual predatory crimes in Alcoholics Anonymous and its culture. See me on Facebook  @ Monica Richardson. Thank you for making this film.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaBelieve it or not, but I am sure many Christians and Catholics will go and see this movie. And probably like it.<br><br>Because there is people who is not afraid of admitting the errors of the Church, and priests are NOT all so. I know some priests that are Really caring people, who even approved things like this (the movie, not the pedophilies)<br><br>But also, maybe the movie could exaggerate a bit the events? I am saying this because when there is a movie based on true events, usually they also change some of those events.<br><br>Like in &quot;Imitation Game&quot;, or &quot;Foxcatcher&quot;, where true and dramatic events were told very well, but also with some artistic license.<br><br>I don&#39;t want this movie to exaggerate, and maybe show the priests who did this horrible sin like ogres or bad guys in a movie style. Of course, I am not defending their actions, I am happy they discovered them, but to exaggerate everything is never a good idea.<br><br>Mark Ruffalo himself said in an interview that he likes how Pope Francsis is dealing with the Church&#39;s problems, and that he hopes this movie will reach him and make him reflect a bit more on these actions.<br><br>I am going to watch it, and then we&#39;ll see. Go Ruffalo, go Keaton, go Everyone!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaat least 5 oscars will be handed out for this film.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaabout time church got butt fucked, they&#39;ve been butt fucking the rest of us since day zero.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWow, a great cast that is not action or superhero. These diamond films in the rough could be a heavy award-favorite.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know that name of the artist who is covering XTC&#39;s &quot;Dear God&quot; at the end of the trailer?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why priests get in trouble for molesting kids. If god lets them do this then it must be ok with him and who are you to question god???!!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI am so going to see this film. I won&#39;t be surprised if it creates controversy. But fuck the mofos who still deny their disgusting crimes. There will always be people fighting for the truth and to succeed in revealing the truth.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the name (or artist) of the song that plays at the end?<br><br>Thanks in advance :)
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the music?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaEveryone who fuck children deserve horible slow painful torture ....NOT DEATH..  The bad thing about this plot of the movie  is that actualy exist and happenig   with milions of innocent children and the pedo church is STILL DOING THIS .  Sorry if my english is bad  i m to emotional now.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThe academy better take note of this film
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhoever is saying that Michael Keaton got snubbed for the Best Actor in a Motion Picture award for the Oscars, is completely and utterly wrong. He was fuckin awesome but so was everyonr else in that category. I&#39;m not even a huge Eddie Redmayne fan, but he deserved every ounce of that Oscar for portraying Stephen Hawking. And it&#39;s amazing how no one is bringing up Mark Ruffalo (nominated for Foxcatcher) lol. Mark Ruffalo is a great actor and I hope he gets nominated again next year.... ok rant over, lets go back to real life now. Movie looks like it&#39;s gonna be crazy good. Take it easy.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaA Disqus user pointed this out on Entertainment Weekly and they have good points. &quot;there is an excellent research published by the University of Oxford, done by independent scholars, which reveals than less of the 2% of the cases of abuse, are attributed to Catholic priests. First clean your houses, in a country like the USA, where the family institution is in total decay, and there are no more moral and ethical values amongst many US citizens, especially within the youth. Divorce is so common than many children are living with step fathers and mothers or foster parents, which in most cases are the true responsible for all kind of abuses, even in schools and college, classmates and professors, represent 25% of the cases, according with the report&quot;
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshita&quot;He wished that all the world&#39;s high and noble would be hanged and strangled with the entrails of the priests.&quot;
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAaaaaaaand here come the Hitchens and Dawkins fanboys ready to pounce on religion and say it&#39;s the most evil thing in the world and this movie should make us wake up! Yayyyyyyyy!!!!!! (annoyed tone intended)<br><br>But the movie does look awesome.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaRachel McAdams investigating again? <br><br>True Reporters, bring it on!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaLOVE ALL THE ACTORS! Love this story too, looks so awesome. I wanna see how it all unraveled.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaStanley Tucci with hair? That&#39;s different
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitathis looks great
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaOh I can&#39;t fucking wait!!!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s one hell of a cast.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I read the article they are publishing in this film?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhat a GREAT cast!! I can&#39;t wait 😊😊
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaOoh Sabretooth, batman, the hulk, mr. Manhattan and the the creator of captain america. 
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaHow is it that everyone except me think it looks amazing? It just lookes boring.....
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaInteresting to finally see Liev Schreiber as someone other than Big Muscleguy/Sabretooth. Dude looks like he&#39;s actually got acting chops.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaOMG this is what you call a ensemble cast. This is what Keaton is brilliant at verbally kicking the crap out of someone to get too the truth (The Paper)
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaPLEASE let Keaton be nominated for another oscar for this movie! Still peeved he was snubbed when nominated for Birdman!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaCue the angry, in-denial christians.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT, this looks amazing! 
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great. This is going to be talked about everywhere. <br>
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaI smell an Oscar;) <br>Looks incredible and it has an important story to tell. Lot of evil nasty people out there that need light shed on them.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaDark horse of the oscars right here, best actor,supporting actress and supporting actor, picture,director and screenplay
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but I hate the trailer that made for it
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThere are two of my favorite hoy guys in this movie; Mark Ruffalo and Liv Schrieber.. ^_^. Can&#39;t wait to see it<br><br>So the story involved a newspaper based on Boston, Liv Schrieber also deal with Boston newspaper in his tv series, Ray Donovan..
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaTrailer Is Overly Dramatic
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaSong name please?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaMichael keaton deserve an oscar for this movie thiss look GREAT
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaDoes somebody know the name of the song at the end of the trailer?
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThe casting though!!!!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaRachel want money, she&#39;s in everything now
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitawow i think this movie is going to be awesome! and maybe this topic gets in a few more heads
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaOscarrrrrrrrrrr!!!
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaAs a Catholic man I am very disgusted by what some priests have done, but people should realize that not all Catholic Churches are like this. The rules are much more strict when it comes to priests joining churches. In 2007, the Associated Press reported that sex abuse was very active in public schools, but that was not reported in many other sources. The monsignor at my family&#39;s church committed a crime like this and after he was dismissed from the clergy, the church and school became a better place. I still believe in God and go to mass every Sunday. I have made lifelong friends from going to church every Sunday and so have my parents. My siblings are also still close friends with people who went to Catholic elementary and high schools. I only went to see &#39;Doubt&#39; back in 2008 because Amy Adams became &quot;America&#39;s Sweetheart&quot; after &#39;Enchanted&#39; and I wanted to see her in another one of her finest performances. However, I will not be going to see this film even if it gets major award nominations.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaThis looks absolutely fantastic. Marvelous cast and an amazing story. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitagreat cast good story  so many victims its a tragedy and the Catholic church protected  these so called men of god for years. more like men of demons
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaWhoa!! What a cast 👏👏👏👏👏
EwdCIpbTN5gdelimeterByIshitaDo you guys smell that? (Sniff. Sniff) I smell an Oscar contender
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie is what Rocky wished it was.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaYeah, they shouldn&#39;t have spoiled the plot like they did in the trailer, but you truly need to see the movie. It&#39;s amazing, it&#39;s not your average fighting movie. It&#39;s seriously an emotional film.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI cried like a little bitch when I saw this movie.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should win an oscar or something!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaGlad I watched the movie before the trailer, so many spoilers
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI know, me too.

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitai do have to admit, i saw the movie last night, loved it start to end.....but the trailer makes it look really cheesy!!! screw this trailer!! just watch the movie!!!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a movie about MMA and it made me cry. can&#39;t give a better review tbh
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita-_- who would think that this movie is not as good as Rocky?
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI felt really bad for the old man, I wish they would&#39;ve forgave him... Almost cried.

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the music in the beginning
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitapowerful, aureate, touching, it&#39;s one of the greatest movies i&#39;ve ever seen! 

It deserves a lot more attention as it actually has.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI did not think this movie was going to be very good, just finished. Holy. Crap. One of the best sports movies I have seen in my entire life. Period.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaYou didn&#39;t! Whatch it!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitalol i havnt watched the movie, or have i already in 2 mins
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitawhat idiot made this trailer , it spoil so much of the movie that im not gonna bother watching it.

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitabe*

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;ve got to bee kidding.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaThis is realy an amazing movie 9.5/10
Loved it!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is amazing. Trailers spoil SO FUCKING Much these days though. If you read this before watching the trailer, dont watch it. Spoils like the 9/10 of the story line
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaGlad I saw movie b4 trailer. Revealed too much.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita8 morons dislike this vid
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaWhen I first saw the trailer I fell in love with this movie, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel that the entire plot of the movie was spoiled by it. Holy hell it didn&#39;t matter, every single fight in the tournament was so well directed that I was on the edge of my seat. Hands down one of the best movies of the year, hell... one of the best of all time. If you havn&#39;t seen it, get on it! I give you my word, you will not be dissapointed!

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaawesome movie
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaHe kinda looks like chael sonnen
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaMy goldfish saw this, now it&#39;s a shark
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI Loved this MOVIE! They should&#39;ve added more to the ending though. Tommys tattoos are SICK!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@wazup3333 it&#39;s a fantastic movie
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@wazup3333 yea but this one is better

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@tsgtdz13 fighter and never back down were great movies tho
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@wazup3333 best fighting movie i&#39;ve ever seen
rocky, fighting, the fighter, never back down are nothing compared to this
it&#39;s just my opinion , , ,
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitais this a good movie if you reply rate it to 5 stars
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaim glad i watched this film without watching the trailer first! but amazing movie nonetheless
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI think this film was a bit överskattad
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies ever made. Trust me, i&#39;ve seen many movies. I just watched it, now I want to see it again.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m telling you! This is the best movie I have ever seen! So amazing!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI need to know the first song or theme i know the one after that conquer the mountain but the one before that one please HELP
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitabest fight film ever...true story!!
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@Lorentsson93 hint: type &quot;replay&quot; after the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;youtube&quot; and press enter
enjoy
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see Warriors 2 what happens with Tommy, this movie made me cry and i didn&#39;t cry when               saw titanic, on second hand, i was stoned but still. 10/10 .
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaUntil today I had no idea you could rape a replay button... Hottest movie today! 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaMovie is soo Original.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaEhmm, it&#39;s shocking a trailer that last more than two minutes. It tell the entire movie! 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaWhts the name on the song tht plays in the background during the end of the trailer? approxmtly 1:30 and till 2:22
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaloved this. actually a great movie.

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitathis movie was great defenetly top 5 fighting movie loved it it should be number 1 in box office but sadly it isnt
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@maul42 huh what you mean dying of cancer?
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@NocturnalExistence Hmm, nuts. A friend of mine just came back with a similar review. Looks like it might be on my &#39;watch list&#39;, then.  Thanks for the input. 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitathe most powerful and emotional sports movie i have ever seen
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@maul42 It&#39;s like what Rotten Tomatoes says about it&#39;s 82% rating. &quot;Warrior relies on many of the clichés that critics of the genre love to mock -- and it transcends them with gripping action, powerful acting, and heart.&quot; GO SEE IT. 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was the bet movie of the year.  A definite top 5 ever for me.  
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@365to173repubsPWNED The went way beyond the fighting. However the fights were actually very good at advancing the plot and showing struggle. 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@hardcorechrisFSU Tom Hardy my bad

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@maul42 its a great movie....
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie has just about every sports movie cliche ever coined in it. Is anyone also dying of cancer? Maybe Dad?
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitatrailer made me tear, btw thanks for the spoiler, brother vs brother for the championship?? Guess we all know who wins the 16 MW tournament 
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitathis or contaigon?
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song that is playing ?
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@speedy02 I just saw it and it was actually a very powerful and moving film...
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@365to173repubsPWNED tries to reconcile through them. my bad
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@365to173repubsPWNED Its the story of a troubled family that is connected by combat sports and tries to connect through it. Also, Brenden is in serious trouble with money because of the banks, and Tommy is trying to help his dead best friends family stay afloat. So yeah, it&#39;s not just kicking the shit out of people.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@hardcorechrisFSU that too. Tom Brady is certainly not bad looking
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@jaigoki IT WAS AMAZING! You must see it
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaEVERYONE HAS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had no idea that I would love it as a highschool girl and it blew me away. As unexpected as every punch thrown.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaYeah ... I, too, would love to beat the crap out of my brother and get paid for it and plus become famous :D
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita....

I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best sports movie I&#39;ve seen since Rocky. This one came out of nowhere
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitathe movie was great. so emotional and inspirational. so much better and more emotional and DEEP than The Fighter. recommend for everyone to see it before they judge it
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitaMMA movies don&#39;t have to be &quot;dumb&quot;.. it&#39;s just that this one doesn&#39;t really inspire much faith to the idea.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitathe main character Tom Hardy is playing Bane In The Dark Knight Rises
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshita@thepianolover4ever not yet.
I5kzcwcQA1QdelimeterByIshitawhen is soon?
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita1:52
Wtf is that?
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitai watched the movie in 2:30 minutes oh yeah!

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie touches your soul! 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really looking forward to watching this film. Kinda reminds me of the 1978 Walter Hill film, The Driver.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@slyner21 Haha well then obviously your a action junkie of some sorts well then yes this movie wasnt for you....

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitadeff one of the best movies that has come out the past cupple years dont watch it on line go and c it 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathis trailer would&#39;ve been better if it was set to Kavinsky&#39;s Nightcall
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaMy hands r little dirty
so as mine 
what a nice guy:)
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell when i searched &quot;Drive trailar 2011&quot;  The mechanic appered ?!!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaI almost wish this was based on the video game &quot;Driver&quot;
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@kaceywells or just accept people got different opinions maybe?
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaWhat the FUCK is a matter with you people. This easily has to be the worst movie ever made. The trailer has all of the dialog of the movie. The audience was literally laughing from all of the awkward silence. The only time he drove in the movie was in the trailer. LIterally the movie is the trailer with a bunch of silence and non-action added between the scenes. it&#39;s not artistic, it&#39;s just complete and utter shit.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaJust saw it, very mature movie that is similar to something like No Country For Old Men as far as the violence/intensity. Driving is really not the focus here, it is more used as a small baseline for the story.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaGREAT MOVIE!!! It&#39;s been a while that I&#39;ve seen something that has caught my attention.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@tsjoencinema  It sure was! and original, too.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@memoir4you Saw it tonight too LOL This was a really good movie. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@jimaoua Believe it or not, they always have.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitasaw it tonight in London, top picture, awesome! we hardly see 18 rated films made anymore but this was worthy
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaMight venture to the Cinema to see this, looks good and some cracking reviews!!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaYou dont got nothing on Transporter
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@carywhitt We are all entitled to our opinions and we all have different tastes in movies. I will agree with you however that the trailer mis-represents the film it advertises. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@beautysam You crap comment does nothing but prove me right. All caps can&#39;t take away from the fact that this movie is close to 90% on RT in both critics and audiences. So you either live in a weird town that only likes Hannah Montana films, or you are lying. Either way, your post tells everyone you can&#39;t discuss a film, probably because you are the low brow of the lowest common denominator. Try harder in life. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@saqibk1 Bronson is great.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaCheck out Winding Refn´s other movies (the director of Drive), Pusher and Bronson.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@beautysam WARNING!!!!! WARNING!!!!! beautysam likes only Adam Sandler and those dreadful Twilight movies
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@KOTE10001 This is NOTHING like the Transporter - if you would go SEE the film, then you wouldn&#39;t make such a comment. This movie is great.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@JTC31290 It&#39;s NOT about the car.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@dellgriff82 you realize you&#39;re an ass right?
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaOOOOOOOOOOOMG!!!! This movie SUCKED so damn bad!!! By FAR the worst movie I have ever seen in a LONG time. No joke. 


This is actually one of the first movies that I felt like leaving not even half way through. The director of this movie should be SHOT in the head. The trailer gets 5/5 stars for being completely awesomely misleading!


It&#39;s an artistic film and totally not what I was expecting. SO INCREDIBLY SHIT!..

WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY........
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@ahalabi777 It&#39;s called pacing. It wasn&#39;t boring at all. Sure, Fast and the Furious 7 it isn&#39;t, but it seems your short attention span needs some work. Drive is a great film. Skillfully executed by a wonderful acting/directing team that will be doing more in the near future (Logan&#39;s Run). WOrst movies in your life? 1. You don&#39;t see many movies. 2. Go sell crazy somewhere else.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@tripjet999 You missed a great film. Next time, try the latest Adam Sandler feature. Sounds more your speed.

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@whitespiritbear You obviously have ZERO taste in good cinema. Drive is a great film. If anything this trailer mis-represents the great film it advertises.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this movie wow seriously had my mind blown....SO INTENSELY AWESOME!!!!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathis movie sucked so bad..
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaWith a title like &quot;Drive&quot; you assume shit movie. This was a shocker for me for this film might be picture of the year. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaYou know a movie is painful to watch when you would rather slam a car door on your hand. This movie is that bad. The trailer is so much better than the movie itself.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@procrastinator87 
im amazed you dont agree
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathis has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. i get entertained very easily and rarely complain about a movie being bad but this one is an exception. extremely boring and slow
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitamovie sucked a**! 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@jimaoua 
Saw the movie last night without seeing this trailer and so glad that we did. Only went in based on a reference and having a free movie ticket to kill, was really nice to have only a vague idea of what it was about. Such a good film! I hope the people I referred it to don&#39;t watch the trailer, total spoiler!

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@jimaoua I recently saw the movie, and I agree; this trailer reveals way too much information.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaNow days I think movie trailers are spoiler trailers....
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaIm in it lol my kind of driving .....
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@andyt1313 
Heck no! I&#39;m expecting Running Scared all over again :)
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita2:08 music

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@cthompson540 I think it&#39;s &quot;oh my love&quot; by Cliff Martinez feat Katyna Ratnieri. check the movie&#39;s OST
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaim amazed how this movie got good reviews.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaAwesome Trailer, I think I&#39;m going to have to go and see this movie :) 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what the music at 1:40 is?
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaall i know is that chrysler better be a hemi, cuz that&#39;s the only way it&#39;ll catch a 5.0 stang
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathe scene where he was in the mask and getting vengeance on the beach was probably my favorite.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaJust saw it.  My god it is gory, prepare yourself.  Pretty good.  If you are expecting Fast and Furious this is not what you want to see.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@dellgriff82 LOL! Too funny! Thanks for the laugh.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@casino16 Believe it or not, you should get paid LOL. I am actually going to see this movie because of your comment. I keep hearing good reviews, but the trailer does not motivate me at all. Thanks for commenting on it. I am on my way to the movie theater :-)
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaFUCK MONEY, why isn&#39;t it a dollar to get into the movies anymore?

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the shit.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaeveryone has the on opinion about the movie. to each they OWN !
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@edgarc92 Just saw it,Great movie,Everybody dies except the girl and her son,and he leaves the money next to albert brooks laying dead in the parking lot.then drives away with a stab wound in his gut.im assuming he died.oh ya spoiler alert.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this is going to be more about plot than anything else. Which isn&#39;t entirely a bad thing but when I hear about something called &quot;Drive&quot; I want racing and chase scenes. I&#39;ll give it a chance but I have a feeling it&#39;s going to be like 2 well done driving scenes then the rest is all going to be plot and story. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitai only wanna watch this because the stang!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaFound &quot;&#39;Walk in the Park&quot;--Early Ryan Gosling music video on Youtube.
PEACE
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@megapunkboy One thing this movie has that the Transporter movies don&#39;t have is that this is actually a good movie.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@KOTE10001 bull shit. see the movie.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaDOES anybody happen to know WHAT SUNGLASSES is Ryan wearing here?!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaOne thing this movie has that transporter does not is someone getting their head stomped to a bloody pulp. That and a blood spattered ryan gosling. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@BESM1984 Same here. This will be the shit.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaGoing to see this today. Really hyped up
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@MrGravity15 Gosling himself did only a few of the stunts, for the rest they used precision drivers and a special camera rig to make it look like he is driving.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitatransporter much :)
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaGot a Steve McQueen-type vibe going on...kinda gave me chills.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@MadVladmcPantz You put some really convincing words up there for the movie to be called shitty. (Sarcasm)

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathe transporter movies were shit.... I dont know who the fuck goes to see movies like that.. I just know they have shit taste in them and they&#39;re the reason more of those movies get made. Transporter and the Fast and Furious ...gone in 60 seconds...all of those modern car movies typically share a few things ... but one of the worst ones for me is car stunts done in cgi on a fucking computer to save a buck, in the 80&#39;s and before they actually had the balls to do the stunts for real. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitahey man this won best director at Cannes so im excited
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitahey man this won best director at Cannes so im excited
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita3 people dislike it because they should of put a camaro instead of a mustang
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaWHAT?!?!?!? You wanna see good acting watch THE NOTEBOOK.... Lmao
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaLmao, Transporter that is rated R.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitai Can&#39;t wait for this movie !  Ryan Gosling &lt;3 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaRyan Gosling is the shit.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaI think that either this or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy are runners-up for the Best Picture award this year at the Oscars. Although I&#39;ve not seen either of them, they book look incredible.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaSo far the plot sounds intriguing like a long Grand Theft Auto IV mission that could easily go horribly wrong. 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks fucking epic... end of story
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaLooks like there is a lot of suspense! action! and speed.....I love it!!!!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitacmon screw this fast five all day every day

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita:(
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like the basics of the book are there but quite a bit of the specifics have changed. I&#39;ll be interested to see the differences.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita@volvo3231:  How can Coyote be &quot;back?&quot;  Coyote is a new engine.  Only the 5.0 (4.9) concept remains.
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshita2011 gt..hell yeah!!!
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitawould really suck if he had trouble getting into 3rd or 4th gear in that stang 
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathums up for the 5.0 stang
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaokay so this movie looks kind of shitty. but since Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are in it, ill go see it when it comes out.

KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitathis looks very good
KBiOF3y1W0YdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting, I&#39;ll have to watch this one!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaHi. I&#39;m Morgan Freeman.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThis feels like paint by numbers filmmaking.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaOh look: another AI story where the surrounding forces have to provide inexplicably inhumane treatment and the AI is inexplicably prone to violent reactions and deadly stares.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThey need to do maximum ride movie
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s going all black Phillipy on them
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitawhat I like about this trailer is how little information it gives, you know? It really understands how to build curiosity and suspense
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitait&#39;s like Splice + Ex Machina
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaYou know nothing Jon snow and wayward pines guy 😄
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaHail Hydra
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitascience fiction is an oxymoron
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMeh.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI think she is just misunderstood
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaGood morning, Morgan.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSo this is like Lucy? Or...
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaEh
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaAgent Murphy, from Narcos! :)
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaCompare to the teaser trailer, it&#39;s a complete let down. Even worse it&#39;s spoil the whole movie, so I guess I don&#39;t have see it in theater right ?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitathis is if Lucy was a thriller/horror movie
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSo happy to see Ygritte in this movie, you know nothing Morgan!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSoooo basically &quot;Ex Machina&quot;
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitathis screams &quot;Ex Machina&quot; to me
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaYgritte?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMorgan? Any relation to Lucy?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSo...Splice?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMutant detected
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitathis look like a mix of the lazres effect and Lucy.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitadont need to watch it now, feel like I know the whole story.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI think its a copy of atticus institute
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so early nobody has made the &quot;hur dur i already know the whole story now&quot; comment yet
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThe Verge said it was scary, the Verge is wrong
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaWhat is spanish ? Yo xD
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitadoesn&#39;t seem scary at all
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThe movie comes out in Sept.  That pretty much guarantees that the studio has filmed it, seen it, thought it garbage, and chosen the worst month of the year for films as the best time to dump it.  Its a shame, because there appears to be some very talented people in the cast. But this looks bad.........
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaa Rose is a Rabbit, by any other.......
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIm seeing it. Done.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting. I suppose this is as close as we&#39;ll get to a high-budget <b>Elfen Lied</b> movie in the mean time :)
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitasplice/species mixed together
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaEhhh!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThis is basically splice
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaReally creepy trailer and I&#39;m definitely watching it..
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaits almost like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ExMachina">#ExMachina</a> movie
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaBurn the witch!!! lol
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThis just makes me feel sorry for Morgan. You are an experiment which we can terminate at any point we like. How do you feel about that? Hope you don&#39;t mind and make sure to behave your self.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaYou know nothing Ms. Morgan!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitait looks like species rebooted...
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaindividuals don&#39;t evolve. populations do. That was highly stressed in my ap bio book.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitathis actually looks really good
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSoulless means no feelings nor emotions without God spirit inside
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSoulless means no feelings nor emotions without God spirit inside
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaHanna, Lucy, Ex Machina, Spieces?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer looks awesome I can&#39;t wait for this film and the actress from The Witch is in it going to be very interesting.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSo an Akira rip-off right?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaOk  why show the whole movie in trailer and second dont make the monster angry by yelling at it :-P
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer gave me goose bumps🔥😱💯<br><br>Hopefully it lives up to expectations!!!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaWow they really went and showed the whole movie huh
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThanks for the awesome trailer! Don&#39;t need to spend money on the actual movie now!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIs it only me that wanted that the trailer wouldn&#39;t have showed Morgan&#39;s true body? 😔
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaGreat, another movie for 10 years old.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitavao fazer filmes dos x.men filhos da puta
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIs this Sigouney Weaver as the Computer&#39;s Voice?!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitafipme bosta
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitai feel like i just saw 70% of the movie -.-
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI can dig it. Ex Machina + Splice + Lucy?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitathis is ygritte&#39;s comeback
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThe Witch 2: Thomasin&#39;s Life.

rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaThank You :-)
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaDeanna! :O
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMORGAN FREEMAN
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMorgan Freeman is that you?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaanother regurgitated story line.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMeh...
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaEu acho que já joguei esse filme no PlayStation
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaEx Machina + Hanna + Lucy
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitablack phillip did it again
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaMichelle Yeoh!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaSo, Species, Alien, and Ex Machina combined? Awesome!!!!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaOMG THIS LOOK&#39;S SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitanice trailer 20th Century Fox
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaFeels a lot like Ex Machina?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI thought the trailer showed too much :(<br>We already saw a lot of people dying and morgan on the wild... why?! :(
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Thomasin from &#39;The Witch&#39;. She&#39;s a great actress.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaWhat was even the point of hiding her face in the teaser trailer? I was expecting her face to be deformed or something but no. Boring.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI thought it is new the ring trailer :d
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaGood
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaBrasil alguém?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m seeing it.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIf Morgan has telekinetic abilities why not just kill them all after the scene at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqmHSR0bFU8&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a>? I tell you why....PLOT...PLOT...PLOT.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaFreeman
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaif the jacket is sold, i wanted it
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaI thought Miss Barnes died when Frank Underwood pushed her into that train. ah well
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitait&#39;s a teenage Species, without the sexy and the nudity... meh.
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaOnce again a science fiction story confuses the term &quot;augment&quot; with &quot;evolution.&quot;
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaIt looks as bad as Lucy was, unfortunately
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaNegasonic Teenage Warhead?
rqmHSR0bFU8delimeterByIshitaooooooooooo

y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t sure about this movie when I first saw the trailer. I&#39;ve seen it a few times now and It looks really funny.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaNow this looks funny.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat does manogomy mean?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhen a male is casted in the lead, it becomes another half-ass might as well call it an indie film that was never taken out of the blockbuster bullshitter. The plot is typical, some bachelor is fine with living the playboy lifestyle and all of his friends are telling him it&#39;s time to settle down. Then a manic pixie dream girl rolls around and he learns to love.<br><br>It&#39;s nice to see a female lead in place of that. It truly kicks ass. However, the comments are sickening. That just goes to show you the double standard.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaSo many misogynists in the comments. Holy shit.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaFuck you Youtube mobile for doing a bait and switch with the video I want to watch and advertisements
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaCena Sucks
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaLEBRON JAMES !!!!!!!!! HAHA MAN THATS CRAZY
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAbsolute, without a doubt, Must See!!!!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaHoly fuck dude, do people really have that much of a problem with the fact that this movie is about a promiscuous average looking woman? <br>Haha jesus god I can&#39;t believe I still get surprised by how fucking stupid people are XD seriously, to anyone who&#39;s complaining that this movies about a &quot;slut&quot; you are so fucking brainwashed that you can&#39;t even begin to understand your hypocrisy
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe all the negative comments here about how she&#39;s a &quot;WHORE&quot; or something. Shouldn&#39;t we all be happy that women are feeling more comfortable having sex more often? (It also makes it a lot easier to sleep with them). Jesus. What are we puritans? Also there&#39;s nothing feminist about this trailer. It&#39;s just about a girl who likes to sleep with lots of guys. I really don&#39;t get why some people feel so threatened by it. This trailer attracts everyone who wants to dump their negative opinions on the world it seems.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshita
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI look like  Mark Walburg ate Mark Walburg. lol
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaRelax people, its a movie.  Geez. 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaNuts, by the title I thought this was a movie about Obamacare or his miserable marxist anti american administration.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaCool. Another movie about a girl being a slut. Nice!<br>
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaIf this were focused on a guy-version of the female character, all the men in the comments would be saying &quot;hahaha whoaaaaa this guy&#39;s hilarious.&quot; Also, if you really think this movie won&#39;t have more depth than just her sleeping around and then someone magically falling in love with her, you&#39;re not noticing that this trailer is clearly all a set-up for what the movie&#39;s main plot will be. Also, yeah, it IS sexist to focus on how &quot;fat and not pretty&quot; she is and complain about how someone could never want to marry her or fall in love with her if she slept around. Like that&#39;s all a woman is worth? It&#39;s dependent upon whether or not a man would marry her? Again, if it were a dude, no one would bat an eyelid and most of these things people are taking issue with would be non-issues. <br><br>Tl&amp;dr: CALM DOWN YA WEIRDOS.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only putting this on my Google+ because I saw John Cena and LaBron James. I&#39;m not really in on seeing the movie.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI love that song at the end. ^.^
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitai swear i know the songs that were used in this trailer i just cant think of the names can anyone help?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThis is funny af
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitawhat are those two songs called ?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJust another fucking feminist agenda movie. Hollywood, the devils most powerful tool.  
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThey gave LeBron back his hair line
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaVapid, self-absorbed millennial the movie... Why would I pay money to see something I get a first hand view of every day for the past... 5 years?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat was the song at the end called?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWierd
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaBill Hader :D Look forward to seeing him in a rom com role
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAnswering the question: how much will you pay for garbage?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshita
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWould like to see pure docomentaries
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJohn Cena and Lebron James = suck
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI just want to know what songs are playing?!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaLOL
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAmy Shumer is great and I acknowledge that a paycheck is a paycheck but this trailer has more cliches  than Hugh Grant`s worst nightmares. Not gonna spend money on it tho. Arrrgggg maytees!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaMovies like this are the reason people can&#39;t have normal, old fashioned relationships anymore.  Thank you Hollywood for yet another huge, stinking, steaming pile of crap contribution to society whose sole purpose is to teach women to act like men, be sluts and take relationships for granted.  Great message!  I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be this summer&#39;s &quot;must see&quot; and get all kinds of acclaim at the next award show for being so edgy and progressive.  NOT        
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like horrible trash
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitafunny...if the main character was a guy instead of a girl, then the feminazis would be complaining about how this guy is a pig
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJust another film where Hollywood exemplifies slutty lifestyles, nothing to see here folks. 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat a disgusting degenerate.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaNo amount of cameos will make this a good movie
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaCool!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaTilda. F*<b>*ing Swinton. *Drops mike runs, out to watch the movie</b>
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaMust read Rick Davis book &quot;Secret societies and their god Lucifer&quot;
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitawhat a gloriously shitty culture.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t particularly like Jews &amp; I&#39;d still watch this film. It&#39;s a good adjustment by Hollywood....despite how liberal they still are.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWow reading some of these comments really make me sad. Some of you really need to lighten up a bit. So much negativity in this world. 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitais that a lady sovereign song? holy shit, wutup 2009
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the first song that played? I know the second one lol
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitawow how do people pitch these terrible movie ideas? The dialogue is so fucking retarded too..  not funny..not smart.. same old bullshit thats in movie theaters these days don&#39;t waste your money on this garbage lol
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAmy is the bomb!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThe premise of this movie is impossible to believe. Look, if she wants to sleep with every guy in the world, that&#39;s her business, do it. But there&#39;s no way that a guy would want to settle down with a woman that has slept with half of Manhattan. He&#39;s just not going to, unless he is a swinger or something, but a doctor? Yeah, right. First off, he&#39;s a doctor, that dude would either be married or knee deep in pussy. As for the jokes, the are as funny as a cardiac arrest on a kitten. Sometimes Amy is funny, a lot of the times, not. She seems to want to want to shock for the sake of shocking. Best of luck on this movie.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the first music please?? thanks
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaYeah. No.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitathis looks terrible.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhy did they cast her, so rank!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWell this explains LeBron&#39;s season...
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to see this movie because John Cena is in it
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat john cena is in this
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI am tempted to just type ,&quot;Cena sucks&quot; just to see the replies.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaMore female entitlement shlock churned out by Hollywood. &quot;I&#39;m just a modern chic who does what she wants&quot;
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI think this is interesting because usually the guy is the one that&#39;s &quot;hit it and quit it&quot; this role change is funny. AND LEBRON JAMES CAN ACT???? WHO KNEW 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJohn Cena?!?!?!?!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it have to be the NY Knicks to be featured in the trailer. Why????
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI just want to go watch this move on the theatre. After the movie ends, the chicks that would be crying are original whores in real life...  This movie is made for New York women aka whores
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitawow thro the whole trailer ? it only showd like a little scene for john cena lol like really
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s go Cena, Cena sucks
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know any respectable people who would behave like that or associate with a person like her.  The only people I know who live so loosely like that are people on the lowest rung of society, with no jobs, lots of drugs paid for with stolen goods, and so many STDs, it is impossible for them to have any more children than the first few they neglect and let run the streets by age 4.  Seriously, no decent man who desires a lifelong relationship is ever going to want a woman who has an ongoing history like that.  And to think, she doesn&#39;t even get paid for it more than dinner and a few movies.  How cheaply can you sell the most intimate part of yourself, hmm?  Apparently, this cheaply.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the second song that repeats are you ready?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaDegeneracy 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWTF is PG John Cena doing in a Rated <b>R</b> movie, even if its just a cameo? If he tried to be funny, it worked, I laughed, but today&#39;s terrible, PG WWE, won&#39;t mention this movie any time soon. LeBron is in it too, and is also funny? Has LeBron been in any other movies? I know he&#39;s going to be in Space Jam 2, but other than that, I don&#39;t remember him being in any movie before. 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitayo la k tengo muchas hancias de ver es la de ted 2
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhat song of the trailer?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitablegh
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaLeBron tho !
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAmy Schumer?  Ugh this going to suck worse then her awful show.  <br><br>Oh look I act like a whore that makes me cool and funny.  She&#39;s the chick version of that douche who talked about how much pussy he always got
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaomg this looks like my new favourite movie
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaNow I got to see this ! asap!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Judd Apatow just made his first horrible movie and now he is relying on cameos at this point!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaMovies like this are the reason why so many Basic Bitches move to New York City.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJohn cena😋😋😋😋
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThe best acting being done is by Lebron&#39;s hairline. I haven&#39;t seen a performance that good said John Trevolta&#39;s in Pulp Fiction
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaI just found out Norman Lloyd is in this (St Elsewhere, Dead Poets Society). He&#39;s literally 100 years old. He really is!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaIs her redheaded friend the female Adam Goldberg?
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshita&quot;I gonna call the police!&quot;
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaV....O.....D.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m here for LeBron
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWhen she hangs up in the middle of him talking = Priceless.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the best/most random movie cast since Guardians of the Galaxy. Vanessa Bayer and John Cena in the same fucking movie! count me in!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good. I can&#39;t wait.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaSo, a talented, highly skilled, funny doctor falls for a fat girl just because she&#39;s &quot;fun&quot; (i.e. drinks a lot)?<br><br>Welp, looks like Disney&#39;s princess stories are all grown up.  Stay bumbling-but-slutty, girls, some day your Prince Charming surgeon will arrive!
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWait, Lebron is funny in this? Aw crap, will I end up actually liking him? Not sure if I can handle this reality.<br>Movie does looks funny, though. Was a bit surprised by that.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaface is a little buttery. 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaAmy Shumer is playing a modern whore? So Amy Shumer is playing Amy Shumer? 
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaColin Quinn is back, gang.
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitathis looks like hot garbage
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJOOOOHN CEEEEEENA:D
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaJOOOOHN CEEEEEENA:D
y_KP9x80Z9QdelimeterByIshitaWe all know one. From Judd Apatow, watch the trailer for Trainwreck starring Amy Schumer! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Trainwreck">#Trainwreck</a>
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitalooks good and boring at the same time
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaWhat kind of accent is Benedict using in this film? It&#39;s different and higher pitched than his normal one...
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshita[starts freaking out over Benedict Cumberbatch, changes to geeking out over the fact we finally have a movie about Alan Turing, goes back to fangirling over Benedict Bumberbatch, but Alan motherfucking Turing....]<br><br>(Explodes from an excess of emotions).  
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be amazing, I actually didn&#39;t need a trailer to know that, but now I saw it, I know for sure
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is telling me that Keira Knightly is still gorgeous.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLijkt me een typische Nederland 1/Canvas film. Ha! :P<br>Might be worth the 12 euro ticket(?)
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;ll always be Sherlock Holmes to me !! :)
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaAnother propaganda war movie.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSo I guess Turing will take all credit for breaking Enigma&#39;s code and Marian Rejewski will never even be mentioned in the movie. Google him. Find out for yourself.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaand a Ulric always repays his debts..
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI think that keira knightley is the spy
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS EXQUISITE
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaAw come on. I should just stop watching trailers. I feel like i&#39;ve seen the whole movie now. Also...<br><br>KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaFor those who deplore the nature of the trailer, know that sometimes we must know the full story before we may truly appreciate the quality of the acting before us.  As this is well known history, I for one look forward to seeing how these actors deliver such a powerful story.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI thought Alan Turing was gay.

nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m  soooo looking forward to this film :D :O Benedict Cumberbatch and Tywin Lannister !!! yaaay ! I love it already :D   ( but does anyone else hear &quot; twerked&quot; at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuPZUUED5uk&amp;t=0m40s">0:40</a> ? XD )
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaCool, I like Mathew Goode, good to see him getting a bigger role.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI am so beyond excited to see this! this is so beyond powerful and I love factual historic films, there are always world war two films about how the nazis are so evil an we won, but its refreshing to show that the bristish was cruel to a men who saved so many.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!! 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis is why I have suffered waiting for Sherlock.... AWESOME!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know if this will be out in the UK? 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitai stopped half way through. saw enough to get me sold on the movie
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaFather of Computer Science finally getting a movie. Cumberbatch is perfect for the role.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSherlock and Tywin Lannister in the same movie ? Awesome! Can&#39;t wait to go see it in the cinema :D
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitai am so excited for this film. it looks really good :D
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitawasnt this already in a movie?..
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI AM NOT READY
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI AM NOT READY
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks so good! :)
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaMovie probably wont give any credit to the Poles who first cracked the Enigma code in 1932, and gave all their data to the brits in 1939. 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaJust watched the entire movie.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshita301 club
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitanice
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t they just hire Sherlock Holmes to break the codes? Or Khan Noonien-Singh to come up with an ingenious war plan? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23SeeWhatIDidThere">#SeeWhatIDidThere</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ImSoClever">#ImSoClever</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotReallyButILikeToThinkSo">#NotReallyButILikeToThinkSo</a>
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley... yeah I&#39;m definitely going to watch this
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI remember in Sherlock the conversation he had with his brother Mycroft about Coventry (They cracked the enigma code and let the attack happen so the Germans didn&#39;t know they cracked it)<br>I just find it funny that Cumberbatch is also in a movie based around that time and will probably have something to do with Coventry.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaOhhhh I think I know who it&#39;s about. wasn&#39;t he a homosexual? He decrypted the code and was vital in winning the war but later was forced to undergo hormone treatment bc he was gay (and being gay was considered &#39;illegal&#39; at the time) I&#39;m just writing what little I can recall idk
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSherlock,  Uncle Charlie and Tywin Lannister hmm.... ok.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Allies win the war
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s an Oscar performance, Benedict
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI remember Benedict and Keira Knightly coming over to my town to film this ^^<br>It&#39;s at that scene at night at about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuPZUUED5uk&amp;t=1m52s">1:52</a> :D
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSPOILER ALERT: HE&#39;S GONNA FAKE HIS OWN DEATH
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitathe mask, was anyone like WHERE IS MY MOMMY?
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks fun. Benedict has this ability to make things fun.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI feel like i just watched the entire movie :(
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI hope theres a crossbow near by
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI can just smell the Oscar nominations from here
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict`s acting in this trailer reminds me a lot of Hawking and Assange mixed… But we will see when movie comes out…I already like it and I know that Ben certainly won`t disappoint his fans. After all he is a brilliant actor.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, just don&#39;t like the title. They should of called it something like &quot;Breaking Enigma&quot; or something. Without the &quot;Enigma&quot; in there it just doesn&#39;t stand out to remind you of what it&#39;s about.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI see comments about Tywin and Sherlock but I didn&#39;t see anything about the new Khan Noonien Singh...
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD... this looks so amazing.. i need a cup of tea
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaIts nice to see keira knightley in movies again. This looks pretty good.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaIM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE DAMN
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be good!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Watson?
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict cumberbatch and WW2 two of my favourtite things in one film :D
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m guessing alot of comments will be about Sherlock, including this one.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, and that one guy from Downton Abbey? Yup, I&#39;m watching it.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI hope this one is way better than The Fifth Estate and expect Benedict Cumberbatch to give a solid performance. 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaGuys Spoiler Alert: The British Win
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict Cumberbatch, Matthew Goode, Allen Leech.. I don&#39;t know if I can handle all the sexiness!!! :D
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaBenedict needs all the Oscars and Baftas now. Hes such a good actor
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaAre you my mummy?
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshita&quot;A beautiful Mind&quot; rip off lol, i could be wrong but it sounds just like it , only that this time the Professor was right.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer really hooked me. I can see Cumberbatch getting a nod for best actor in the near future
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaAHHH I NEED TO SEE IT. Ben&lt;3
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaYay. We get to hate Tywin again. :P
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSherlock: The Imitation Game.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaSherlock!!!:&#39;)
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks great
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer doesn&#39;t really gives too much away, i mean we already know the story of Alan Turing so...
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie for the big screen about Alan Turing with an amazing cast to carry it. I can&#39;t wait to see this in theaters! 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaWell, now this is a sure watch.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s a good cast for a drama; I hope it&#39;ll be good.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaTywin and Sherlock in the same movie? Definitely going to see it now.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThe ultimate nerd ...  
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaWhole movie in trailer xD Didn&#39;t students from Poland brake enigma ? xP
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaA slightly less autistic Sherlock.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaOscar for Cumberbatch!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitabet Keira is a nazi spy
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaAlan Turing the most bad ass man in computer science.
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Sherlock could act
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer revealed too much story..I hope the movie has a twist in it
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaam happy to see smuge again..
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaDang....
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaDang....
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaNice nice nice nice nice nice nice NICE NICE NICE lol

nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaTYWIN vs SHERLOCK
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitasherlock, tywin lannister and elizabeth swan in the same movie hmm wonder how will it turn out
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLeave out SOME plotpoints ! 
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshitaLooking out for this movie!
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshita1
nuPZUUED5ukdelimeterByIshita1
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely has a shutter island vibe and plot
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1rLFCdewU&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> Uroboros?
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaOh I didn&#39;t know they were remaking Shutter Island already!!!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaLame looks like shutter island 2.0... Another attempt by scientologist to legitimize psychiatric help to mentally disordered.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaShutter island, the movie
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaWow I didn&#39;t know One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest was getting a remake
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaI watch this trailer in black and white and it looked glorious!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThere are so many scenes shown, I feel I already know the movie :/ Also, it reminds me of Shutter Island... Could have easily seen Decaprio in the main role
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaShutter Island...
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaBWOONG, BWOOONG, BRWOOONG
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer make it look like a action movie and I dont think its the good orientation for this theme.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaFirst trailer was way better. Couldn&#39;t even finish this one. Too spoilery and cliche.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaStrikes me as boring, if this is the best they can preview.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaIs the cure Paleblood?
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaGood grief! The Republican party&#39;s proposal to replace Obamacare is rather dramatic!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaHillary Clinton spotted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF1rLFCdewU&amp;t=0m16s">0:16</a> (lol)
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the whole movie was shot with IMAX cameras.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitapeople are saying it&#39;s a copy of shutter island. well the only similarity is its set in a mental institute. oh, and the shot where he holds a lighter up to his face in a dark room (which I&#39;ll agree is probably a slight nod to shutter island). but other than that it is its own film, and it looks FANTASTIC! my only problem is that the two landscape shots of the alps and when the train is pulling up look a little fake. maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m watching this on my small phone screen but I hope they are not cgi and are done by the skill of the cinematographer.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis honestly gave me goosebumps. Looks beautiful. Saw the trailer ad on a creepy pasta video haha. for once I actually watched the entire ad
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitawho else is getting the lovecraftian influences here ? i think this looks great ! cant wait to see it
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with the German train?
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure what to think of it.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaLove me some Dane dehan
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaGore Verbinksi is back doing what he does best.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaShutter Island anyone?
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one that thought...Shutter island
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaWaited so Long for that trailer. The castle where the protagonist is driving at, is in South germany near I live. It&#39;s so exciting to see this in a movie. Love it !!:D
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThat voice at the end though
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaWow 2017&#39;s Shutter Island is coming! :)
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis could be some modern day lovecraftian horror. Hype!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshita&quot;shutter island 2. a new guy.&quot;
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaOhhh nice, looks cool
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitathis reminds me of Shutter Island with Leonardo DiCaprio
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited! The cinematography is really good!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThat train window shot was beautiful
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaam depressed already
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting, unfortunately another trailer that spoils too much.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty cool.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitathat hospital remains me of the government
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaJust shows you how a trailer can effect a movie. After the first trailer i had no interest in this movie, now after this one i&#39;m excited to see it.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshita... and hello to Jason Isaacs.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitais that the same guy from OA? if so why is he a mad scientist in 2 things back to back....I mean they both look like ripoffs of kimmie schmidts captor(john hamm). just a thought
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be such a great film! I&#39;m excited to see it.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaShutter Island 2!!!
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaholy shit...I trailer where nobody says &quot;OH MY GOD&quot;.....I&#39;m watching this
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Big Birds Great Adventure.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitabruhhhhhhhhh
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitathis looks like the orgin story for outlast.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThats my fetish.

JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting some Shutter Island Vibes here
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaShutter Island meets Dark City. In 2016? This is a blessing.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaMaybe it&#39;s like Ex-Machina. That movie took me by surprise.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of shutter island, am i the only one who thinks this ?
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaI am intrested in this movie because of this trailer but it probably gave away too much. I don&#39;t know, i&#39;ll just have to see.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be very interesting.
JF1rLFCdewUdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! Quality &amp; setting is astounding 😍🙌😍

MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaYou know this actually looks alright.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or is Kevin Hart the new-age Eddie Murphy?<br><br>Remember when Eddie Murphy was the only Black comic actor ruling the big screen for the whole of the 80s to mid 90s and today we have Kevin Hart whose been doing the same since 2009.<br><br>Anyway, the movie looks funny as hell; I&#39;ll give it a go.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitahow the hell they&#39;re goong to survive that fall
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaOnly watching this for the Rock.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI really want this to be good but I know it won&#39;t
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaTbh, The first trailer had me like &quot;Eh&quot; but this one got me like &quot;Aw, that&#39;s cute but eh&quot;. That&#39;s a good transition. I might see it now. Might.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaNice of Universal to let the Rock keep his Fast and Furious outfit.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitawhen Kevin heart does the back flip he(the stunt double) should have landed on his face, like half way through the flip his face smashes into the floor, not the weak way he falls in this trailer, If youre going to do physical comedy the more painful the funnier it is
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaC A N C E R
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThis looks cool
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaA little Hart and a Big Johnson😘😘
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitakkkkkkk deve ser bom o filme
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitathe rock
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a maybe. Depends on what else comes out around June, I guess.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaso every 2 months there is a Kevin Hart movie?
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitabadass
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaShout out to Ms Lovato this is like the 4th time I&#39;ve seen her song used in an advertisement.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLIKE!
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer, can&#39;t wait!
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaBrasil
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitabest thing ever kevin hart with THE ROCK
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitathe rock looks funnier
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaDwayne Johnson &amp;  Kevin Hart !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;3 <br>i am way more excited to see this Than Batman V Superman ! ;)<br>...u know why ? .... Becoz !<br>The Rock is the Hollywood Version of SAITAMA !<br>... and yeah it reminds me of 21 Jump Street and Ride Along !
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThat fat Johnson at the beginning is the worst CGI I&#39;ve seen in at least a decade.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be better than ride along 2
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitanaaaaaw not feeling it
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitanaaaaaw not feeling it
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLol
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaNot a bad concept. I like it.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaFat Dwayne Johnson alone is worth the watch.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitasong?
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitahahahha lol Fat <b>THE</b> <b>ROCK</b> <br><b>xD</b>
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaJust watch haters in the comment section talk about how much they&#39;re tired of Kevin Hart.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitalitle bit look like 21 jump street but it might be amazing than that
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d only watch this if somebody else was watching it first and I just decided to join them.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaDamn......can&#39;t wait for it
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks okay but The Rock is AWESOME :)
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxEw3elSJ8M&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a> I thought that was Superwoman&#39;s t-shirt ahahah it&#39;s awesome
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThat just looks awesome :)
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita&quot;Let&#39;s do the flip&quot;😂😂😂😂😂💀💀
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaIm a simple man, i see the Rock, i buy a movie ticket
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitafrom the man who hasent been in a good film and the director of an awful film but goddamnit why the hell do i wanna watch this just for the rock?! hahaha
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaRipoff ride along
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaJohnson 💪👍
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaAgain a trailer where basically the whole movie is spoiled
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI think Kevin Hart should stick to stand-up comedy. This seems like the same role as in Ride Along only now there&#39;s a different supporting actor. It&#39;s kinda annoying hearing that same high-pitched lame-ass voice Kevin does. His comedy is awesome, his acting in movies... not so much.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaKevin Hart in a cop movie! Thats an awesome idea! Why haven&#39;t this been made before?! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh right...
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaDamn i love the Rock &lt;3
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita0 :8 ahhh
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaYEEES With the rock
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitathis gone be funny as hell gotta see it😂😂😂😂
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaBasically 21 Jump street then?
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitamin
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitathis type of movie was done a million fucking times with the same people even. where is the originality?
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI am so downloading this.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThis is a dumpster fire
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxEw3elSJ8M&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> &quot;Aim for the bushes&quot;
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaRide Along ^2
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaзачетно!
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLol you can clearly see a stunt double when Kevin Hart tries to do a backflip. 😂
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLooks OK, will definitely give it a go.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaWow. Can&#39;t wait to see it. Nice collaboration
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaTake that Kat Williams.  Kevin Heart has worked with two of the best actors alive. The Rock and Will Ferrel. <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fuckkattwilliams">#fuckkattwilliams</a>
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaparece que o jogo virou...
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita😂😂😂😂😂
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaNah....
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThis will BE GOOD
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaBR!
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaHe should&#39;ve just said he was clangin&#39; and bangin&#39; for the last 20 years.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshita2 more days for marvel netflix daredevil season 2 comes out.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitathis gave  me 20 types of cancer
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitalooks like ride along 3 without ice cube
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a simple man. I see The Rock, I dislike.
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaMeh kevin&#39;s movies aren&#39;t good really. This looks like ride along featuring dwayne johnson
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaWhat did I just see
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Fun! Can&#39;t wait!
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaThat guy so cute 😂
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaKevin Hart 😂😂😂
MxEw3elSJ8MdelimeterByIshitaI am so down with this!

VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaThe last scare reminds me a little bit of the scare from LIGHTS OUT. I&#39;m excited for both films!
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitathis doesn&#39;t even look scary.
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaNOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer made me jump while the last one didn&#39;t, I bet this is only part of what he has in store for us on the scary aspect of things, I feel like this is going to be really scary!
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaI´m so happy they didn´t reveal many scares like the main trailer of the first Conjuring.
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitathat nun
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaLast time they showed the whole movie in the 3 trailers(except for the final scene).. I really hope this time they don&#39;t

VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitathe first one is so fucking epic hopefully this will be too
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaPlease James, I hope the best of the film stays out of this trailer...
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaI honestly thought this was a parody
VFsmuRPClr4delimeterByIshitaWow

tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaPrim dies
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaLooks way better than Insurgent..that one sucked.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWell it doesn&#39;t say part 1
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaHis mom is too young
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhy r u guys against tds like that i dont know about but i think the books and the movies are awsome
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaso no part 1 and part 2 bullshit?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitais it me or are they trying to make her look like Jennifer Lawrence?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaTris dies
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI bet this is better than Insurgent. Can&#39;t wait. 😄
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaIs this the last movie?! Please be it!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWell this one look better than the other one. But I just finish watching the whole movie so no point in watching it at the theater
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaDid I see the new star wars trailer?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitabasically they spoilered the entire movie...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to bootleg this one.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaEven if this doesnt match the book at all, it still looks really good. But lol it wont win any awards except for acting
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how I feel about this!?! It&#39;s completely different than the book, wtf
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitavanaf the na week new year smoge film 🎦 in biscope in Star 🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟👍
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitathese one in particular seems pretty rushed
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWell at least they didn&#39;t divided the final one into 2.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good! divergent and insurgent was trash though.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitathe most pointless movie series of all time.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaNot trying to be biased but this seems exactly like the scorch trials
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaEither I completely zoned out while reading the book or this is rubbish. I am pretty sure it&#39;s the latter though.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat, you mean they didn&#39;t split the book into 2 films, that&#39;s outrageous, how else are they going to make a profit?!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitapretty much the whole movie right there lol
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty good lets hope they change everything since the last book was garbage.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaTrailer = spoiler.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaPlease stop comparing The maze runner to these films, they&#39;re nothing like them both visually and story wise. People put a lot of effort into making these films and make small sacrifices to do it, can we just respect that please.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaIt doesn&#39;t come out for 4 months and you they give away 80% of the movie?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaAnd the trailer revealed the hole story
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitathe pain from this is too real
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI hate this sequel, its just to cliche
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI HATE THIS, THIS MOVIES DESTROY THE BOOKS
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaJeff Daniels had such a great year with Steve Jobs and The Martian <br>Shame he has to start next year with this shit
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaGostei muito
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI volunteer as trib-- Oh.. wait . wrong movie!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat i understand from this trailer, this main characters are going to fight with the guys who have techonology  &#39;centuries&#39; ahead from them and going to win? Hmm...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone even give a shit about this franchise?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaAGHH YES FINALLY
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert:<br><br>Tris dies
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThey could spend the budget of this film on a decent original idea instead of this YA bullshit
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so bad, tipical stuff inspired by Twilght crap.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaso they start a rebellion, fight the rebellion, realise they fucked up and want to go home. sounds good...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaGarbage series
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis shit doesn&#39;t deserve my money
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t particularly like this series but I can&#39;t stand these pricks in the comments that post spoilers!!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SCREAMING EVEN IN THE TRAILER THEY GOT THINGS WRONG
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaidk but this kind of looks like a let down compared to divergent...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWow, this movie looks incredible! I can&#39;t wait to see the scene with Katniss in District 2. I wonder if Peeta&#39;s hijacking will be shown more in this one.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitathere will be two movies......&quot;The Divergent Series: Allegiant&quot; which comes out this march and &quot;The Divergent Series: Ascendant &quot; which comes out 2017.......check it out on imdb about Shailene Woodley...(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940362/?ref_=tt_ov_st">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940362/?ref_=tt_ov_st</a>)
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!! This seems soo epic!! But i am wondering how they will end the first part...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitathe Divergent Maze Running Hunger Games: Breaking Dawn, Part 1
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThos is basicialy the whole movie xd
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaBetween this, Hunger Games and Maze Runner, I&#39;ve forgotten what was going on. They should just make one final crossover movie of all three tbh lol
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat, is it cool now to post spoilers or something?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaAnother generic young-adult book to film adaptation series: Allegiant<br>I guess it&#39;s fun for the people who read the books
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaIn the books the technology wasn&#39;t nearly as advanced...
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaOkay I haven&#39;t read the books, but this looks the same as Insurgent.
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaKinda dying 😍😍
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s okay, not amazing, just okay
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWho remembers four from the inbetweeners movie?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitahmm very similar to maze runner, hunger games, etc but still enjoyable
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaLook at that blonde hair, woah well done  you fiNALLY GOT IT RIGJT

tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaOMG 😎
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaomg i can&#39;t believe that the people on the other side of the wall were actually the bad guys, how unpredictable
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaSo excited to see how they implement Tris&#39; death - hopefully not keeping her alive as her death is one of the saddest parts of the book!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaDonald Trump approves of promo speech <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE8LEPSTK6A&amp;t=0m09s">0:09</a>

tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat the heck. Why are they flying in eggs?
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaLOL. Look at this rubbish. Bow down to The Hunger Games: Mockingjay PART 2!
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so similar to the book! Evelyn against the people outside the wall, Tobias &quot;destroying&quot; tris and the others! I can&#39;t wait !
tE8LEPSTK6AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m officialy freaking out!!!

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaMr. Stark, Tony&#39;s dad? 
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitamaybe this movie will get nominated for Best Picture (not to jump to cconclotion) and since 5 superhero movies are this year, the Academy Awards can open up a new cateogory fro &#39;Best Suphero Film&#39;
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita@innovasian i disagree about that movie, but to make you feel better he&#39;s also K in &#39;Men in Black&#39; (unless you hated that too)
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaoh shit two face from batman forever is in this!

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitahaha omg tommy lee  jones

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaMost impressive looking forward to it!!
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like they&#39;re ripping of Zack Snyder with some of the fight scenes...not that that&#39;s a bad thing, of course. ;)
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita@six1brat yes, you are. 
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the music playing in the trailer
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita@six1brat He used one in the very beginning. He stopped later on. The recent Steve Rogers has started again.
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaHYPER-- CHARGING STAR!!
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita3 people need 2 die

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita@Marvel  Thank You
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer that makes this movie actually look good! I&#39;m excited!
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitameh..looks aight.

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita3 PEOPLE ARE COMMUNISTS!!!! 
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita3 people are communists!!!
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita3 people need 2 die
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaim a huge fan of comic book movies but honestly based on trailers the movie that really excites me is THOR,i know there are loads who love CA but looking @ the trailer its quite ordinary. as of now GL and CA the trailers released looks average (but still il watch all 3 of them) n belv me in this case im unbiased coz im a HUGE batman/bruce wayne fan,(n i actually like GL than THOR or CA)but in movie perspective THOR is the one i wanna watch coz of really good marketing n kick ass trailers.
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitano voices? wtf?
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaOMG this is so beautifle :D

JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaCap is fuckin beast all u people talkin shit that he isn&#39;t the most powerfully are pretty fuckin dumb. Cap has amazing fighting skills and could take down most foes just by that. Movie looks good tho, all the haters on cap need to go fuck off.
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m having a nerdgasm right now.
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaFirst off- &#39;Now, Mr. Stark&#39; ooh Iron Man connection.
Secondly- DAT GLITCH MOB AW YEAH
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaThis has got a Rocketeer, Indy Jones and Band of Brothers feel written all over it!! 

and Im so glad that theyre using the mainstream version of Cap and not the douchebag asshold one from the Ultimates version.


JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitaCaptain america !!! yeaaaaaaaaa !!! 
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshitacap with a gun. looks like (mdk)!!!!
JerVrbLldXwdelimeterByIshita@EasternGateGuardian Yeah but Captain America isn&#39;t that anymore, as a matter in fact most of the comic characters today have someway deviated from what they originally did or stood for in the Golden Age.

XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best True Story. Such a Masterpiece 💖🙂💯👌
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a beautiful dairy of a person. To get away from toxic world .
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWho came here from twitter?
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThey should show this movie to High School kids. Spare them from the 100k college debt.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaIf you consider to watch this movie, this movie is really good!
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI even got emotional watching the trailer. I don&#39;t know why this movie always makes me so emotional. It&#39;s so beautiful
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaTho similar to Life of a Pi,<br>it has been changing the  thoughts and ideas of peoples all around the globe!! A GR8 MOVIE TO WATCH BELIEVE ME OR ELSE WHY WOULD I WASTE MY TIME TELLING U ABOUT IT!😁
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaIt depicts our emotions and feelings!!😀
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAs someone whos 21 and enjoys the wilderness and going far deep into the canadian bush to backpack I found this such a great movie. I wouldve liked to go and see the magic bus 142 in person but last year authorities removed it.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitathe girl next door actor is here
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely stunning, it makes you think about life especially in these times do we need all the things that we have the things just make things complicated amazing film.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWas this movie good? I read the book. Krakauer is such a good writer. Right away I&#39;m thinking Sean Penn before even seeing the credits. Also Timothy Hutten. I&#39;m interested in the home life that he had. I took off for Oregon, similar reasons. Still alive at this writing, but only because I didn&#39;t take any chances.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the worst trailers ever.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie ever made on this planet. This is not a movie this is emotions
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZG1FzyB8DI&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> that 1 scene gave me goosebumps
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAlexander Supertramp had everything you could desire. The foundation he no longer wanted, would have been happily embraced from a human experiencing real poverty. The individuals that are not happy with all that they have, do not realize how good that really have it. Alexander Supertramp was not prepared for this journey and he did not respect the power of mother nature.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaSome people see Chris as some kind of folk hero. I get his thirst for adventure and shucking off the confines of societies imposed ideals. But he made some really stupid decisions. His romanticism got him into a situation he was not even remotely qualified for. When he wandered away from that truck into the Alaskan bush at that time of year with a bag of rice and a few bullets he was committing suicide.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a simple guy, if Catherine Keener&#39;s in the movie, I&#39;ll watch it
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this dude was a total dumbass!!!
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis is like very western version of &quot;dervish&quot; almost same philosophy, expectations and everything
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitathis guy needs to discover   mountain biking or bike packing.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has a different place between all other genre
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has a different place between all other genre
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie 🤩😍
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaNathan t’es la?
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAs someone who has dedicated my life to my career in natural resources and am an avid outdoorsmen.. I still cry every damn time I remember his story and see this. It hurts. He was dumb at times... but my god did he love life and everything we wish we could do.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39; It&#39;s better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing, than a long life spent in a miserable way,&#39;&#39; said Alan Watts, it&#39;s from his speach about how to live our life;<br>&#39;&#39; .....It’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like, in order to go on spending things you don’t like, doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we’re bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lifes we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it’s all retch and no vomit. It never gets there. And so, therefore, it’s so important to consider this question: What do I desire?...&#39;&#39; -  Alan Watts
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaLolllll, still! Wauw
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis is how humans were really meant to interact within this planet. <br>More humans are beginning to realize this, now, in 2021.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie but sad story (never blame society for your suicidal tendencies, ur life life is urs) :O(<br>I live &quot;into the wild&quot; and I want to die there ... but OLD<br>&quot;Être et durer&quot; that&#39;s what the french (paratroopers) army tought me when I was 19 ...
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is terrible compared to the movie, pls don&#39;t rely on this trailer... the movie is the best
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaa  movie that you never want  it to END,    😁
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaNaparito ako dahil sa MODULE.<br><br>Any grade 10 here?
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitabased on the true story of...........Henry Thoreau
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaJust finishing watching it. I get the whole journey of discovering yourself growing as a human finding freedom me peace but his ego and stubbornness got the best of him
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI just notice that he broke the fouth wall when he was eating a apple.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitanow guys this is what i call a real movie<br>unlike the emoji movie that sucked monkeydick
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWho else read the book?
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAnything that gives you freedom is right<br>Anything that destroys you is wrong
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI got emotional only by the trailer
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who’s watched the movie or hasn’t, should totally read the book, “Into The Wild” by Jon Krakauer. It captures Christopher Mccandless’s story on a whole another level. It’s a very emotional story full of his adventures, obstacles, and achievements he went through. Chris Mccandless “Alexander Supertramp” will be remembered by many.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis was one of my favorite movies and Emile was one of my favorite actors, until I found out he’s a woman beater.  I guess I should finally read the book.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaManyak her yerde manyaktir
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaInto the life.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaHe looks like Jack Black
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI just watched a documentary about Chris McCandless and discovered that he didn’t cut up and toss out all his identification and money. For whatever reason, the authorities didn’t retrieve his back pack from the bus, but a local man did. It appeared to be empty, but the guy found a hidden compartment which contained Chris’s wallet. Within the wallet, there were probably 7 or 8 pieces of identification, including his DL, SS card and a library card. Also, there was $300 in it. I have heard some folks theorize that Chris set out on a death wish and for years I sort of wondered about it myself because I earnestly believed he had erased himself by getting rid of all identifying documents. To hear that he actually didn’t do that more solidified my belief that he fully intended on going back home, or at least going back to civilization. Chris, aka Alex Supertramp, your story absolutely breaks my mother heart and I feel as if your life and death was both a love letter to and an indictment of Generation X. I do not think you held beliefs and convictions very different from the rest of us Gen Xers, but you had the balls to actually act upon those impulses and convictions. I wish you would have survived your self-imposed rite of passage because I think you likely would have had a lot to say and people would have enjoyed hearing it. RIP Mr. McCandless, I hope to one day meet you on the other side.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaHonestly let me just say this 1st Sean Pean made this story come to life, true life in every moment in the film. This movie has nothing wrong with it, it is perfect in every way shape and form. He did something that brought me to something I never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want a movie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this is it, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. Its long but you&#39;ll probably want more when you don&#39;t want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaBeautifull Road Movie, with very spontaneous and lively scenes, a portrait of the archetype of the lonely traveler who faces the unknown
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaEmile Hirsch should play John Frusciante if there is ever a Frusciante biopic.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is wonderful.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitamake a decision and never look back.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaEsto es basado en echos reales pero al final el tipo fue encontrado muerto en una camioneta meses después de escribir una carta para que lo salven y murio por no comer ni poder hacer nada porque habia un rio gigante que le inpedia ir a la civilización, murió completamente sólo, hay una foto de el solo en la vida real la foto es igual a la esena que salio al final de la pelicula fue muy triste
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe best movie ever

XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI really hated the movie... it didn’t make any sense to me....
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever made
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie i watched❤️✨
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitawhy did he have to die
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis is based of a man who lived in an abandoned school bus and died after he got stuck from a river he couldn&#39;t cross
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaFrom Raza samo
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZG1FzyB8DI&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a> is that kristen stewart wtf
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe best move of our time
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaLearn to live a balanced life . the decisions , the choices , the sacrifices you make for sake of your bleeding heart , is eventually gonna make impact on your tomorrow which is irreversible so ‘ be a stable rebellion ‘ and learn to find peace within !!☮️
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaEgo ego ego damn ego<br>🙏
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was absolutely fantastic. Its a damn shame its not on Netflix.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaStopped watching 43 minutes into the movie. Something about the character that I don&#39;t like. Not the actor, the character that he&#39;s portraying.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaLife is so cruel sometimes .....all I learned yet
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitakind of reminds me of the kyokushin founder journey he too ventured into the wild in order to train
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaGood movie but I wish they didn&#39;t play that sh*tty music though...
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie proved that a man need society, it can be bad tho. The man&#39;s responsibility is to fix this bad society. We have to face problem, leaving the problem is not best choich
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaAn intelligent and poignant expression of dissatisfaction with the American Dream which, however misguided, arrives at the truthful realization that no man is an island.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWould’ve loved to meet him
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaPlz can u upload this picture
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe ending was so heartbreaking 😢
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWhy this guy reminds me of leonardo dicaprio?? I mean he is so similar to him🥺❤❤❤❤
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaMovie was good but read the book first.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWhere I will find this movie ?<br><br>It&#39;s available on amezon prime and Netflix
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis is an excellent biographical drama movie! The ending was very sorrowful...
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that he died from his own stupidity🤩
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaGod the ending still gets me
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThis is how Pokémon adventure will be in real life 😍😍😍
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaHad to do nearly with everything wrong with America. People look at this as an accomplishment. Boy runs out on his family and the movie paints the parents extremely negatively. Ya, America is filled with broken families and kids with psych conditions that run off. That&#39;s not something to applaud in a movie. Destruction of families. No God. common them in American movies for the last 30 years. Go to your family. Have peace with them and go to God to find ethics, morals, values, and a real love of nature. Besides that, the movie had a great soundtrack and a solid cast.
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaWaiting for some douche to say “wHo’S hEre aFtEr SeEing ThE HeLiCopTeR MoVe ThE bUs”
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaGod I hate this era of movie trailers
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaComing to Netflix June 1, 2020 can’t wait! Will be my 3rd time watching this lol...great story
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitahave to write a report for my final....hehehehe
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe best
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaThe lesbian agenda
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaIm sure the director really loves eddie vedder
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaA film about the real things in life
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies of the 21st century. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaI think his EGO destroyed him.. He Never forgave himself and the people who hurt his ego!
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaSeems to be good
XZG1FzyB8DIdelimeterByIshitaToo bad he never made it back
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitai thought this would be a movie about sweden...
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI wonder if FBI imprisons him or not, pleaze no spoil.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaa true american hero
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaYaaaasssssss!!!!!!!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshita&quot;Hmmm, how do we sell this?&quot;<br>&quot;Sex it up.&quot;<br>&quot;Which part?&quot;<br>&quot;Sex it all.&quot;
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaA true hero
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaif i were snowden, i&#39;d definitely  masturbate to this trailer
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaim game for whatever will make people realize the truth of the matter, but I really dont like the fact that its taking Hollywood making a conspiracy movie to make anyone understand the repercussions of this.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWell...Yes he&#39;s a true hero, but this film doesn&#39;t look good, or at least not like Citizen Four which is much better, because it&#39;s the true documentary. Have mixed feelings.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!!!!! TOO MUCH EXCITE TOO MUCH EXCITE!!!!!<br><br><br>WOWOWOWOWOWOWWOOWWO!!!!!!!!! ..... hope the movie is as strong as the trailer
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaJG Levitt nailed the voice of Snowden.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI still wonder if the younger generation actually believes to what point every electronic thing they do is open to observation...the scary thing is that most do not seem to care.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI hope they don&#39;t over-hollywood-ify this important story. <br>This shouldn&#39;t be really about Edward Snowden the person (or the hero / the traitor), it should be about what he has done, and the things he exposed to the world.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaJGL actually looks like he killed it at Snowden. Really good performance
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSince Snowden is in Russia he&#39;s probably seen this movie by now. :D<br><br>Wonder if he liked it!?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThe NSA is watching everyones reaction to this trailer through their camera phones.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaOh Yes!!!!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaits gonna be a Seat edgyy thriller...
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWhich true story is this based on?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis actually looks really good!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSo Hyped for this movie :)
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI hope they don&#39;t make a serious concept mockably insincere. I understand it must be styled for the cinema and for easy digestion for the public, but what happened wasn&#39;t small for this mans life, nor for the public&#39;s perception of the vastness of information stored and accessable by government agencies.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis better be good
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaIs this the sequel to Enemy of the State?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaGee idk...feel like the director was goofing around &amp; told Joseph to do a King of the Hill voice for a scene to be funny. &amp; then he was like no Jo, nvm that doesn&#39;t even sound like Hank Hill &amp; it&#39;s not funny. But Joseph thought it was hilarious &amp; proceeded to do it throughout the entire shooting for this film. Idk
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaEdward Snowden approves apparently. Check his Twitter.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaHoly shit his voice
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitawow &quot;glenn greenwald&quot; looks old.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaEdward snowden is fake, NSA is real and NSA safes lifes
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooks good. I want to see it.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaNow all we need is the &quot;oh my god, it&#39;s Jason Bourne&quot; line,<br><br>followed by the <b>Screeeeeeeee</b> sounds from Extreme Ways
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWow, this looks terrible. I&#39;ll just stick with Citizenfour, thanks.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis is getting more and more ridiculous.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSnowden, synonymous with honesty, true patriotism, heroism in the face of a government that no longer represents american values.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlSAiI3xMh4&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> &quot;Ah, this looks juicy&quot; sounds an awful lot like &quot;Ah, this looks cheesy.&quot;
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitathis looks like shit, seriously, just like shit. Another Blackhat, another Hackers, just another shit movie, because Oliver Stone can only make political war movies. Making this look like any other &quot;recruit going for the big guns&quot;
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitalooks cringe af imo
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitahaha oh my god, what the hell is that accent? Sounds like Jerry making fun of his ex gf&#39;s stomach noise &quot;Heeeellllloooooooo! Laaa laaa laaaaa&quot;.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaAll the dislikes on this trailer are from NSA employees who are forced to dislike lol 😝
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitanow hopefully more Americans will know who Snowden is.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThe actual based on real stories movie.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaHYPE
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaGreatings from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Anonymous">#Anonymous</a>!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaif they don&#39;t at least nominate Joseph Gordon levit for this performance, I will personally boycott against the oscars.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty great!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis looks intense as fuck..
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaYes, they&#39;re making a movie about him!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaNIC CAGE!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaNicolas cage talking about the internet hahahahahaha
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t f**k this up.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a good film. Subject matter is timely. Snowden told what has been happening for years. It&#39;s still happening despite claims that it isn&#39;t. What choice do governments have really? I don&#39;t mind them going through my emails, cell phone data and such.  If you don&#39;t have anything to hide you won&#39;t either.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaReal American Hero! In a country where lies are the truth, the truth becomes treason! Thank you Snowden!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaall down votes from nsa employees
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitalooking real good
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshita18 dislikes? NSA&#39;s early.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait for this to come out!!!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitathis movie is sponsored by US government and CIA to  &quot;clean&quot; their image? if it&#39;s the case i will not watch it :/
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaEvery one be like shailene woodley and im like NICOLAS CAGE
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaTHE CAST OF THIS MOVIE ! GOD THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE AWESOME I CAN&#39;T WAIT
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaInteresting political thriller with a great main antagoni-<br><br>Is that Nicolas Cage?<br><br><b>*flashbacks of those scenes from The Wicker Man and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*</b><br><br><b>*Imagines Cage doing the same thing in this movie out of nowhere*</b><br><br>TAKE MY MONEY.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI love Oliver Stone (and Nicolas Cage!) and want to see this, but my goodness is this trailer shittily cut with corny reaction shots stitched together. When will trailers stop doing cheap imitations of emotion and just show a story to get people interested in seeing a movie? Hearing screeching noises along with a phone ringing and dramatic cuts between unrelated shots is not dramatic. We have nothing invested in this crappily cut trailer. We&#39;re not wondering, &quot;Oh my goodness, who&#39;s on the other end of that phone?!&quot; Because it&#39;s a fucking hastily cut trailer that has absolutely no build up to that moment or anything else. It&#39;s not shocking. Fuck off.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooking forward to seeing this. <br><br>If you only understood how bad it actually is. Even of the folks who consider themselves to be &quot;technologically skilled&quot; only a small fraction actually &quot;get it&quot;. It&#39;s so bad... and only possible because of the incredible amount of ignorance born by the general public. Even knowing that it is possible isn&#39;t enough, once you see it for what it is... You can&#39;t unsee that. <br><br>I hope you learn to stop trusting and &quot;loving&quot; your technology more than yourselves and start to give a shit about the future of your country, yourselves and your children.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSo glad that going from the trailer he isn&#39;t gonna be labeled as the bad guy and that it seems to straight out show him as the good guy and the US government as the bad ones.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitawow he&#39;s really good. the voice is spot on
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe Ant-Man just did THAT!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaCIA wanted NSA powers. Snowden worked for the CIA before the NSA.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaAnother story for the American film industry to get wrong...
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s hoping that Oliver Stone breaks his 20 year losing streak and releases a movie that&#39;s actually good.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaAnother shitty accent by JGL. I&#39;m not suffering through this.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaThis got to be the only movie I see that the protagonist isn&#39;t as good looking as the original.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaTrue hero.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaNick Cage!!!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWhen the actual girlfriend is hotter than the movie girlfriend.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWe know who killed Kennedy the CIA....Area 51 never existed....and I&#39;m from the government here to help you...remember this is a movie....but Stone will make thus point....thus government has too many secrets, too many armed agencies, too many employees, and we can never ever,ever,ever,ever trust anything they tell us The old USSR was honest they told you up front they are watching you and screwing you. Our great government does the same thing or more all in secret all the time telling you your free and safe. You know this movie will be condemned by our leaders and secret agencies. Only because they git caught. As a vietnam veteran I say thank you Stone And Snowden. And for all yiu that think they are traitors go look in the mirror.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaNic Cage is also in it? Nice ^^
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaYESS Shailene woodley 💜
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWhen one has to flee his country to expose government  illegal activity.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshita<b>NICK CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE</b>
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaShailene 🙌🏼🙌🏼
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSHAILENE WOODLEY IM 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaActors who don&#39;t know how to use metasploit. Interesting
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaHistory will show him to be a patriot.  The idiots of today just don&#39;t know it yet...then again, the majority of idiots are debt-enslaved robots, obese, and asleep.  Now, get back to work, update facebook, and worry about the NFL.  It&#39;s worked so good so far, right?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaShould I be afraid to up vote this?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaPlot: guy gets hired, steals some files, hides in China and Russia, skypes a lot.  That&#39;s the whole story.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaIt looks cool but for some reason also really really cheesy
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaEverybody knows the Story.. Trailers shows the whole Film. So Why I can&#39;t wait to see the film??? WHY??? WHY???
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWow his accent is on point, almost creepily so
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaHoly shit Joseph Gordon Levitt. Someone with some balls.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaOmg I didn&#39;t expect such a great trailer<br>And the voice of Joseph Gordon Levitt masterful <br>Now I can&#39;t wait for this one
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaYeah but who killed Kennedy?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaStone makes up his own facts even when the real ones are known. Who would watch propaganda no different then what he derides the government for doing?
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaochen interesno
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI mean we already have Citizen Four.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaim sure this will be factually accurate...lmao
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooks very interesting indeed. Oliver Stone&#39;s rendering of these events should be very enjoyable to watch.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaSHAILENE WOODLEY🙌❤
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaLooks so interesting!
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaYASSSSS SHAILENE WOODLEY
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaI hate how it&#39;s marketed like a spy novel, but I guess there&#39;s no choice because it&#39;s a serious subject.<br><br>I&#39;ll be walking in the theater expecting to watch a semi-biopic.
QlSAiI3xMh4delimeterByIshitaWell he nailed his voice
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaI love it

8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best action films ever and superhero films ever
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaLove all the iron man movies:)
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaBack when the MCU was grounded in reality and not filled with futuristic nonsense.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t believe i grew up with these films 😪😪

8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaI love you 3000.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaIt’s impossible to find the original trailer from 11 years ago
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaProduced por Avi Arad,  Kevin Feige studied for máster
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaFarewell Mr Stark
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaThe editing of trailers also have changed a lot. They basically gave away the entire movie chronologically. But damn still one of the best marvel movie!!
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaLooking at infinity war and all the movies from the last maybe five years, iron man definitely is such a different film. Then it was revolutionary and it still is.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshita<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugaeA-nMTc&amp;t=0m00s">0:00</a></b><b> and a legend is born</b>
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaAvengers Endgame, good bye super hero Iron Man ^^
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaAnd I... am Iron Man
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaIron man is still my hero 😞<br>Rest in Peace, old friend.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaDamn! This trailer sucked. Revealed almost the entire movie. I am glad that I did not watch this before I watched the movie some 11 years back. Remember being totally blindsided and having a blast at the cinemas.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaI seriously pray that he wears the mechanical suit once again before it&#39;s all over.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaThe starting point of the MCU.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaSuch an awesome movie 🔥
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaBirth of an entire universe...
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH ACDC
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaI wish more than anything that the first Iron Man would have came out on January 2 2007.  And I am extremely pissed off with the stupid ass bullshit year it came out.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaAny trailer with both Black Sabbath, AC DC, and Audioslave is the best trailer ever.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaA legend was born
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaIt will be hard for newer generations to understand why some people value these films so much...
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaI do not like this movie and then it&#39;s all
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaHard to believe it&#39;s been nearly ten years since this and Infinity War.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaA long time ago,before Infinity war
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshitaWe have come from a long way...<br><br>... I&#39;m with this franchise &#39;til the end of the line.<br><br>Edit: Alas, the end of the line turned out to be Endgame.
8ugaeA-nMTcdelimeterByIshita&quot;You are a visionary, Tony&quot; <br>Captain America, Avengers EMH<br><br>And with this, a Universe was born...
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaDamn, would almost rather watch Zombeavers again... and what a terrible movie that was(not that I would not expect it), but this... this looks sooo boring.... I guess I&#39;m not the right age yet.....
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAdam Driver is the DRIVER
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitawhen darth vader wants you to live normally
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaJim Jarmusch is the man. I hope Tilda Swinton is in this too. She makes cameos in many of his films.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThose thugs will get a saber through the heart if they try to steal that dog
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaI can see the lovers from Moonrise Kingdom. :D
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitalooks gay, starring the guy who killed Han Solo.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really looking forward to this one.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaSo when did kylo ren become a bus driver
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaMy city Paterson
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThe girl died, because she ran out of time. He wrote a poem about it while driving.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAll Iknow is this looks interesting and that Indian girl is gorgeous!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaI love that they filmed some of this in my very diverse hometown Paterson, NJ but just from the trailer, it seems like they have whitewashed the town and made it look like a different place at some points. I like Adam Driver as an actor so I&#39;m hoping the movie redeems itself and does my town justice!!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of the snl undercover boss skit, only that was worth watching
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaqueue unoriginal, uninventive, unfunny Kylo Ren jokes
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThis is what happens when you kill your own father, Kylo. You become a bus driver and a struggling poet. Han Solo is probably giggling and clapping up there watching you.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good because it doesn&#39;t look like another movie about a laid back charismatic bright guy burning days until a breakthrough, it looks like a movie about said guy just living the life and enjoying it.<br>And yes, I just reviewed a trailer. How low we have fallen.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaI adore Adam Driver he is so goddamn beautiful
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaFinally a Live Action &quot;HEY ARNOLD!&quot; movie.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAdam is finally a Driver
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaIs this Forest Gump, but focused on the common man rather than the eventful past.?
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaWHY IS THIS RATED R?!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaLol why did the Asian guy need subtitles... he was speaking English
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThat was deep.......now hurry up and make star wars please.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaIf something happens to that dog, i will lose my shit.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThose 2 were in Moonrise Kingdom!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitathrow in a lightsaber
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaGolshifteh bah bah
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaSo is this being released on Amazon Video or theatrically and just by Amazon Studios? &#39;Cause I really wanna see this!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaSounds a bit like Mumford, where a (spoiler) con-artist pretends to be a therapist called Mumford in a town called Mumford. Quirky.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s so cool to see my hometown in a movie. I hope they show the gritty side too.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaPC version of 8 mile
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaKylo Ren goes undercover as a bus driver named Adam. His Matt alias was compromised on Starkiller Base.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaSome language
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaKylo&#39;s part time job ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Kyle Ren doing!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaKylo Ren really sunk low after the death of Han Solo, defeat from Rey, and the destruction of Starkiller base...
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitawhat has the flash done to the timeline
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaWhen the Starkiller base blows up and Smoke fires you and all you can get as a job is bus driver lol.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaKylo approves
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaJim Jarmusch is a voice for the generations.. Can´t wait to be moved by this promising masterpiece
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaGonna make about $72.25 at the box office.  Adam Driver playing a driver named Patterson in a place called Patterson.  Really?
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU&amp;t=1m57s">1:57</a> Those are the kids from Moonrise Kingdom...
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAdam Driver as a driver.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitadidnt understand
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaKylo Ren is practicing driving to get ready for the Millenium Falcon

m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaI wouldn&#39;t want to get on a bus driven by Kylo Ren
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThis is a really good trailer
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitahe kinda looks like matt, you know the radar technician?
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshita<b>Obligatory Kylo Ren comment</b>
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaTake note, Hollywood.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThe force was weak with this one .
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaWhere in Paterson
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaWait I&#39;m from Paterson... There&#39;s like maybe 30 white people thy love here and none are bus drivers..... LIES !!!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD WERE THOSE THE KIDS FROM MOONRISE KINGDOM
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaGolshifteh IS CUTE!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitathis is dope Kylo Ren putting Jersey back on the map, New Jersey is an incredibly underrated cinematic state
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaThis feels like Adult Hey Arnold
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitabad movie

m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitawell guess what? time is not the 4th dimension

m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaYo<br>I live paterson <br>Probs should say that
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaHow can you not love this guy?
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAdam Driver&#39;s voice is my new favourite thing. First it was Benedict Cumberbatch and now him.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaSo we finally know what Kylo ren was doing during the split between the 6th and the 7th movie
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaAdam DRIVER decided to leave the 1st Order!
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaEven without the 1-ton helmet,  he still sounds like Kylo Ren.
m8pGJBgiiDUdelimeterByIshitaDid I just see both the stars of Moonrise Kingdom on the bus sitting together?!?!

imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaI hated this movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaIt’s so bad 😂most cringey piece of Edm shit I’ve ever seen😂 if anyone thinks this is shocking or eye opening go to England and do a year at uni in Manchester or Leeds it’s just daily life😂 I’m not English either
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaRiff Raff looks amazing.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThey made a whole movie about post malone
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaTrash movie though
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was wild.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaFrom gummo to this
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaActing game Riff Raff
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaBrace yourself!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a vibe
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThese new disney channel originals are certainly getting more mature
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaLook at my shit!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was over rated in the sense of &quot;we were suppose to find ourselves&quot; kind of nonsense through the chaos of drinking and partying. Then Faith gets weird when she is around ppl she doesn&#39;t know? Like yea you knew all the randos at the hotel too? Then again JUST a movie.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaBoring
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was alright but nobody in it was likable.  I literally hated every character that came onscreen.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitajust saw this..... absolutely beautiful &quot;It felt just like a dream.......&quot;
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaReminds me of spring break 2014 at South Padre island
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThe movie turns 6!<br>Still one of my favorite movies of 2013<br>A cool soundtrack too <br>Met all my expectations
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWhy didnt Taylor Swift get cast in this movie? Aren&#39;t her and Selena Gomez bff&#39;s??
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaIt will forever vex me that people judge this movie without ever seeing it. It&#39;s a bait &amp; switch people!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWhat was this movie?
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaI’m not gon lie it made see Vanessa Hudgins different
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSpring Break Forever
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaMost repetitive movie ever. Poorly written. Characters very poorly characterised. I&#39;ve never seen such  a &quot;cliché&quot; &quot;movie&quot; like that. An hour and a half that is worth 30 minutes. Don&#39;t waste your time on this crap.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaBest movie ever
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshita<b>This movie was so hyped...trash</b>
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaave maria o trailer é perfeito da até uma animada a gente pensa que é um policial misturado com comédia e putaria adolescente, aí chega na hora de assistir, deprimente, chato, só algumas cenas legais, trilha sonora fuleira, a trilha sonora deixou o filme mais triste possível, esse filme tinha tudo pra ser divertido
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSuch an awesome trailer for a shitty movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSo ho does it compare to fucking Gummo? :D (honest pls)
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaJames Franco, Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Gucci Mane etc. Movie is 🔥🔥🔥 Sex, Drugs, Money, Killing. All in One MithaFuckin&#39; Package, Most Underrated Film.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitashlept on movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaA film of sexy women with guns.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaIs that Selena Gomez!? WHAATT
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWithout this film,A24 would not be what It is today: The company that gave us The Lobster,Ex Machina,The Witch,Moonlight,20th century women, Lady Bird,etc
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaToo much tittttttts on this movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaLike how Harmony cracked on Pussy Riot. A+ level trolling. Such amazing culture it is, the new American Spring Break.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis is an art film with bitches &amp; a grill.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was abysmally awful
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWatch Kids written by Korine..Dope af compared to this💀
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSpring breakers forever💞👍✨😜...
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaNo1 find it weird Selena keeps calling her gma thru the movie, telling her she should b there, its fun n shes meeting guys. N she want to go w her next..lmao. 😂wtf
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSpring break forever
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked. <br>Cheap idea, sex sells,  made for teenagers who are easily dazzled by drugs&amp;partys.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaAt first I thought what Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine were wearing are bathing suits but then I figured they were Bras and panties but then I was told that they’re just bathing suits and then I found out that they were clothes on top of them was because so they don’t feel cold!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis film should provoke the government to bring back the Hays Production Code.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaAshley Benson and Selena Gomez is my favorite actors ..❤
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWatch the trailer, you get the idea, skip the movie it offers little more.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaOne of the worst movies ever.... LOOK AT MA SHIIIIIIT
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaI remembered when this used to be my favorite movie and now looking back, I don’t know what I was thinking
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaOnly watched this because skrillex did the soundtrack
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is incredible. If you&#39;re a young person, watch it and be warned. If you&#39;re a parent, watch it and be warned.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThey only keep you interested with the titties
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaY&#39;all: The movie.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaI lost millions of brain cells watching this piece of shit movie.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaFranco looks like Post Malone here. LOL!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitai liked it
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a biblical allegory for those who dont understand
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaFranco plombe le film.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSabrina Vanessa judges 15 💋

imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaGabriella!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaRealy bad movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaNever would&#39;ve guessed Harmony Korine (same guy who made the Trash Humpers, which is probably the strangest and creepiest movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life) made THIS with REAL, BIG NAME actors.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWoah so many famous people in this movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWorst and most repetetive movie ever! The story doesn&#39;t even makes sense...<br>Give me my hour back...
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaomg i saw Gucci Mane
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie barely has a meaningful script
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaYa&#39;ll: the movie
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitashit movie yall
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis is why Conservatism has a strong grip in the US.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshita°•○●💕
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWhats the song 1.08
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaRiff!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitathis movie fuckin sucked
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitai wish selena gomez wasnt in this she was way better than this dam it smh way better than this fuck Justin fuck franco
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaYo me esperaba mucho mas, igual esta buena
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshita&quot;spring break forever bitches&quot; Vanessa hudgens
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis is the coolest trailer
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of so-called Italian sexy comedy in the 70&#39;s (featured usually Edwige Fenech or Gloria Guida), with a dark and serious twist though.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaWhats the song?
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaBURRR
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitajust imagine Miley Cyrus in this movie.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me the name of the song playing at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imDML4om8z8&amp;t=0m47s">0:47</a>?
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitapeople who think this movie sucks havent lived the party college life or been to spring break.. the scenes with the exception of the robberies and killing are pretty accurate (robberies are sometimes a part).. out of control, drug experimenting, alcohol, sex etc.. while in the moment you do want it to last forever, but it cant.  i actually likes it and watched it multiple times. theres a lot to take from it.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitathat movie is bullshit, sorry James Franco... but that was bad.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaA todos se nos ha revelado nuestra existencia, Casi siempre esta revelación se sitúa en la adolescencia. “El Pachuco” un estado de espíritu o ausencia de espíritu, escribe O. Paz de su estancia en L.A. (1950). Vestimenta, Conducta, Lenguaje, Rebeldes instintivos, a pesar de su fanatismo y su voluntad de ser, no afirma nada concreto, sino no ser como los otros y en ésta ambigüedad el Pachuco no quiere volver a su origen Mexicano y tampoco desea fundirse a la vida Norteamericana, a través de un Dandismo grotesco y de conductas anárquicas, si señalan injusticias e incapacidades de una sociedade que no ha logrado asimilarlos. El Pachuco ha perdido toda su herencia, lengua, religión, costumbres, creencias…. Le queda el cuerpo, si tiene alma con ella, son inermes a las miradas, su disfraz de dandy lo protege y al mismo tiempo lo destaca y lo aísla: lo Oculta y lo Exhibe. <br>El Pachuquismo es una sociedad abierta en US donde abundan las religiones, y atavíos tribiales destinados a satisfacer el deseo de la sociedad Norteamericana, la abstracta moralidad del American Way Of Life.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaHanna Marin? Really? I don&#39;t care if you make Selena and Vanessa tramps, but when you mess with my little liars, it&#39;s on!!!! HANNA IS NOT A SLUT!!!!

imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaBraids and grills all day
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaIts funny no comment
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshita
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaomg  I almost thought this was a real movie!!  SNL nailed it again!
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis is so fucking gay it could run for......nevermind
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was amazing. Best this year so far by far.
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitawow this movie looks awesome!! love ashley benson
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshita^Virgin
imDML4om8z8delimeterByIshitaFirst. Ha! Always wanted to achieve this! :P
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@DecoyCruz wow, i wish i was cool like you and got high. how proud you must be. way to go little buddy!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI just got finished watching this movie and it was really funny!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita1:17 BRASIL EU TE AMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaseen this movie twice now... high both times.. id like to see it sober so i actually remember it cause i assume its great hahahaha
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m not even sure what end that came out of&quot; LMAO
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathis is the FUNNIEST movie of my life!

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThat scene in the plane, when she says that she saw a woman making butter - LMFAO
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitais this song ACDC&#39;s :D ?

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitai love the part when they were at the Brazilian diner and the big lady said she doesnt bloat lol
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaone of the funniest films i&#39;ve seen in so long!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathis movie is all about women thing...
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThe constant comparison between Bridesmaids and Hangover further strengthens my belief that people focus more on sex and race than anything else. The only things these comedies have in common is a wedding and they&#39;re practically same sex casts. That&#39;s about where it ends. The Hangover basically takes place over 1 day where 3 dudes look for a 4th dude who&#39;s hardly in the movie. Bridesmaids takes place over weeks with 1 main chick and 5 co-stars. Different feel, different jokes, different movies.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaHilarious movie! When she was in the wedding dress running across the street in the movie she didn&#39;t fall did she?

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaDude this movie was actually pretty good I&#39;m always dreading Kristen Wiig on SNL but somehow she was totally awesome in this and the movie was put together really well.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaEveryone told me I was gay for watching this, then I showed it them and they became gay with me. I&#39;m not gay though. PS-Kristen wiig is the most beautiful women in the world...
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaha just watch it with my gf she has been wanting to watch it and i thought it was gonna be one of those same old movies which it kind of was  in sort of way but the characters  were f... hilarious( Look Away Look Away!) Best part ever
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece. Really hilarious and the acting is outstanding.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathis looks like HANGOVER female version :D that fat lady will b Allan... they wil b a good match :D
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitawhats with the R rating, im 16 and completely fine watching scenes with sexual behavior, as long as its not porn or strong enough to turn me on~
seriously, i watched &quot;friends with benefits&quot; and it was an AWSOME movie and most of the sex scenes are absolutely hilarious :D
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaseriously one of the funniest movies ive seen 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@udelgrl i see what u r saying the only things the same is the wedding and the bride disappeared the day of :P it was an amazing movie though
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie, very funny but there was moments, you wanted to cringe due to how embarrasing the scene it was. This film isn&#39;t like Hangover, it&#39;s more serious comedy type of film, my fav character was Megan, she was halirious, and fav scene was the bridal shopping, lmao. 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movies and it is halirious!! I laughed through out the whole movie!! It&#39;s a must see!!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason, I really love this movie.  :)

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@0vlade0 LOL! soooo TRUE!! always noticed tht!! O_o LOL!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThere wasn&#39;t one line that I thought was the least bit funny. It looks like ANOTHER total stinkbomb out of Hollywouldn&#39;t.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita1.11
BEST KRISTEN WIIG FACE EVER.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitasolo la vere para escuchar la cancion de Britney :D
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI saw Paul with this actress, it was Hilarious, I saw this film with her, and I laugh harder, it&#39;s really enjoyable. The acting is AMAZING.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathere are lines in this trailer that are not in the movie... and i watched the unrated version, so... :o

Till 3/4 of the movie: good and quite funny... the 1/4 left: eeeee.... :-s
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@wiwigroove in what part? because i cant hear it ;S 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just here to listen Britney song &#39;I&#39;ve Just Begun (Having My Fun)
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita&#39;Like&#39; if You saw this just to Listen Britney&#39;s Song &#39;I&#39;ve Just Begun (Having My Fun)&#39;
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathis movie is: The hangover (with womans!)
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaCa a lair trop nul putain
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaAss to Ass!

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@ELQUITO12 o yea, , ,

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitanothing but old sluts
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@JordansConcept Fucking dumbass
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaLove you Jennifer Connelly, if she is in that movie.. :-?
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaLol. I just watched the movie. And 75% of the lines and scenes from the trailer are not even in the movie. :D
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitanothing like the hangover because it is better, it got higher ratings than both hangover movies! woooot!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@0vlade0 not in the movie: what happens in vegas
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaSo many Hangover snobs.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThis tailer is a joke ! THE MOVIE SUCKED. the only funny art was the bathroom and the fat one the blonde girl wasnt funny she was mostly fucking
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@turnon55 Fat people are not a &quot;race&quot; jackass... actually im pretty sure fat people would have nothing to do with anything involving a race of any kind.

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@udelgrl 
In trailer they pretty much made it like hangover..
I saw it, its good but there is no movie that is funny like  Hangover.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaIt was so so so funny. I really cried because I was laughing so hard! :)
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita2:05 = hilarious! /// everything else= not so much

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathis is an amazing movie, i loved it!!!! x
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaEasily the best 2011 movie so far. 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely loved the movie!!! The car scene was the best :&#39;)
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaTHE BEST GIRLS MOVIE OF ALL TIMES!!! SO TRUE!!!!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita1:07 Finally we see Rose!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitasaw this movie and its is totally different than the hangover...yes it involves a wedding, but the only reason ppl are saying its like the hangover is because its a comedy with a group of women...its a completely different movie
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitatheres always a fat funny person in every comedy movie

FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaKristen Wiig is so great!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@TheTrailerCREAT0R  females version sucks,
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita1:57 awwwwww :D
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@TheExistingFilms partially true, but how many british stars are currently selling out the box office ?

It&#39;s not shittier just Americanized, frankly I&#39;ve watched british television and movies. There is too much realism (think fat old people in corrie and eastenders) compared to youthful hot shows like most of our sitcoms/soaps.  

You Englified The Apprentice , do you see any of us complaining about uglier contestants and smaller budgets ?

Hollywood &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; British Media




FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@TheExistingFilms exactly what i was thinking!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@TwilightStarrr123 yaa!!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaIs that Suki from the Gilmore Girls? xD
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@RumRiverRebel well, what did you expect from the creators of &quot;the 40yearold virgin&quot; LOLL
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitafail...
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitathumbbs up for dirty deeds done their cheap
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@Maddiox3 ooooor that this movie wasn&#39;t made with you in mind. Weird.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaha, hank and erin from the office .
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitai hope this hope is good 
I like Kristen Wiig and its about time shes stars in a hit. 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaMan.... This just proves that women aren&#39;t funny
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so exited for this!! haha Can&#39;t wait, looks awesome!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaugh, idk. i like the girl from the office tho. 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m excited I love Rose Byrne lol and the chick from RENO 911!!!!!! roflmao
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitawow...so original!!!
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaNormally, Kristen Wiig is my 2nd least favorite SNL cast member (mainly from all those crazy overactive roles she&#39;s in nearly 3/4 of the time), but after seeing this, I just might start liking her more often.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaBORING
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaMelissa Mccarthy (the fat one) is a longtime member of Groundlings. youtube &quot;Marbles Harsgrove.&quot;
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitafail lol. this is why they shouldnd make comedys only for chicks. specially not since its a hangover ripoff lol.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this? A chick-flick for guys? Color me intrigued... 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaawsome
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@ManiakSDR 
i know i subscribed to hi too ever since episode 19 or 20 thats how i found out about this
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaAlot of those girls are actually really funny, and with the &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; crew attached, I think I&#39;d pay $10 to see it.  
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitalol cant wait
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@xtremanater321 Dude i&#39;ve been knowing that, i watch a show on youtube called Movie Buzz with RallisP thats where i got the news you should subscribe he gets all the info first way before TV does his show is pretty good.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitawas that nick frost in a woman&#39;s dress!? lol
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaThis could have much better potential if any of the leads were actually attractive.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI think I&#39;m going to hate their female equivalent of Zach G.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitafucking
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaI find it funny that people accuse it to be a hangover rip off; as hangover basicly stole everything from Apatow and co. 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitaStupid F%$#&amp;ing Movie 2: don&#39;t see it 
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitahad to cast Kristen Wiig for this shes such a great comedian
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshitarosie odonell is acting  again? She lost weight.
FNppLrmdyugdelimeterByIshita@ManiakSDR

vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the song the trailer opens with?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaYe gods that&#39;s a terrible exoskeleton design.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaTakeshi Obata is Here !
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshita&quot;This is not the end&quot;....i lyk that sound....:)
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool and the gear looks much better than the junk matt damon had on in Elysium. 
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaanh Tom come back
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaFirstly. Music definitely doesn&#39;t coincide with the theme of the trailer. And the words thrown at you;  Live. Die. Repeat. Live. Die. Repeat.  Repeat. Repeat??? I had the impression they wanted to bore the shit outta me with this trailer, then there is the awfully uninteresting plot, only thing good about the trailer was the visuals, definitely thought this was a halo movie, though some of it looked too videogame-ish. I&#39;ll just wait to see more from this one
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!  Loved &quot;Minority Report&quot; &amp; &quot;Oblivion&quot;  So when Tom Cruise makes a sci-fi flick, I&#39;ll be first in line.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitawhat song is in the trailer?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaMusic song  ?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitalook&#39;s cool and it has action something i cant turn down in film&#39;s.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaDespite the presence of Mr. Scientology, I might actually see this.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprised I liked this trailer so much!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitareligious ban on high-explosive, thermobaric, automatic and nuclear weapons<br>AGAIN
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLove interest i ffing hate that when you see it on every movie you would think they would try to change that
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaIs Halo!!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshita+Lino Silva Try Muv-luv the trilogy, Starship troopers, Blue gender, Ender&#39;s game.<br>Just because it&#39;s scifi and theirs aliens doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s similar to Halo.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaGroundHog Day 2?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaDamn. I have 6 months to finish the book.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaHalo movie is now out !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitasome ofthose alien creatures just look like the zerg from starcraft II
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshita엣찌 오브 투머로우 꼭봐야지~
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaAHAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaNice trailer WB! ^^
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaJó lehet végig
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaБля, ну чё вы такие ахуенныйе трейлеры то делаете. Сначала восход юпитера, теперь и грани будущего...
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaWow. That&#39;s one of the most ill-conceived trailers I think I&#39;ve seen. What I am looking at is a high-energy, exciting, possibly even complex movie. But what I&#39;m hearing is music for a sappy, syrupy-sentimental, draggy chick-flick that most chicks wouldn&#39;t even want to see. Not my &quot;chick,&quot; anyway. Yikes.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshita&quot;All you need is kill&quot; was such a cool title. &quot;Edge of tomorrow&quot; sounds cheesy as fuck. Movie still looks fun though.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t freaking wait for this!! Hope the story does it justice!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw61gCe2oqI&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> Ghost!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitanice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitathey should have kept the robotic voice out it&#39;s distracting.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaI need that song guys, youtube commentators never failed to deliver .. pls deliver.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaEDGE OF CGI
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaSweet!!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaI keep plugging in my controller but nothing&#39;s happening!! Let me play your game Activision! 
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaDamn!  Watching this trailer makes me realize that Emily Blunt would&#39;ve been the perfect Black Widow, possibly russian accent &amp; all.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaDamn, this is the closest thing i have ever seen to Starship Troopers exosuits! ( the BOOK not that lame movies -.- )
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaIs this sequel of battle los angles?
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaultimate !!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitayeah Tom Cruise the Hero bla bla
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitathis trailer was about a minute too long
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitais it me or does Emily Blunt look gauntly thin, generally she is gorgeous but in this looks gauntly
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaI was so desperately hoping this wouldn&#39;t look shitty. Glad to see my prayers have been answered.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks something to Halo...
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaSnooze fest 😴😴😴😴😴
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitawhy would anyone wanna read the book and spoil their movie experience??
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks surprisingly awesome, as usual.......if Tom Cruise is in a movie, I&#39;m in. 
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome. Hope it&#39;s better than Oblivion though.<br><br>P.S check out my short film &quot;The Last Road Home&quot;.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitathe song is epic pls the name
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaYES!
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks sick.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a mix of all the sci-fi movies that have come out in the last couple of years. But Emily Blunt is in it so I&#39;m in love.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaLooks shit no offence
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s it. I&#39;m sold.
vw61gCe2oqIdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song? This robot voice... Tnx!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be amazing
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitano wait that&#39;s not what I meant, I mean I have no doubt the movie won&#39;t suck, but the trailer seems weak. 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking amazing
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita@Marquis0420 Mr. Tumnus from Narnia ;)
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIs emma frost from the future?
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaCAN&#39;T WAITTTTT &lt;3
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaJFK said Cuber lol 

This movie looks epic
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaTHS LOOKS AWESOMEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita14 persons will burn the fox studios
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita@Insane4lifez Why does it look like shit though?
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIts from the director of Kick-Ass so its going to kick ass!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaSHIT YEA! finally a real BEAST! 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita***** seems very darth james jones
dark pearl
not a white pearl
what a set up
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita@scrapmetal58 they probably will in the future. They can&#39;t just leave it with Xavier in a new body and Magneto with his powers back. If they do then that&#39;s shit 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaDios mioooo tengo ke sobrevivir hasta junio para ver esta pelicula! estoy verdaderamentre emocionado!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaHELL YEAH! :D
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitafuuckkkk yeaaaaaaaa that was fucking awesome
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaAt first I was like &#39;This is going to suck.&#39;

But then I was like &#39;FFFFFFFFF---- want.&#39;
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaNo thanks
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI was tent here by Timmy Allen
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaSeriously I;ll be soooooo broke this summer with all this super heroes movies I was hoping for them all to come at different times so I can save enough to watch them all.
I have one choice and one choie only........MOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM can I borrow 20 bucks!!???? LOL
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI wish they would have continued on from The Last Stand. Wolverine was kind of boring. This looks better but I hope they don&#39;t mess up the continuity. To live up to Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen will be a huge task.  
The first three films were awesome. I hope this doesn&#39;t turn out to be mindless action movie for teens.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshita*****
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaokay, I guess this trailer vanishes the low expectations about this movie!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI love it!!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaPixie&#39;s in this?! She was only created in the past few years...how odd...(0:55)
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaSo Beast and Mystique are in their 70s in the previous X-Men movies? They age very well. Angel Salvadore is now a mutant hooker? 

That said, the sub shot looks great. 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaDamn :O that was pretty badass I&#39;m definatly gna go see this movie love the choice they picked 4 magneto he really looks and acts that part n damn the chick wit the dragon fly wings is fine as hell ;D I&#39;m lookin forward to seein her
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaFUCKIN AWESOME!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaepic!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitadef looking forward to this :)
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaOops....meant Mystique!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI got a vibe that this movie will just be OK, 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI got a vibe that this movie will just be OK, 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaHell yeah!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks great ! (except for the Rogue cg transformation snippet).
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaok i spy somethings in here that are not kosher but over all it looks like a fun movie it looks good. 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks great ! (except for the Rogue cg transformation snippet).
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FLYING SUBMARINES! THIS IS AWESOME.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaFuck Yeah!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaNerd alert!!!  Cannot wait for this.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaEmma Frost!!! I can&#39;t wait!!!! 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaOH MY FAKIN GODNESS!!!!!!

HOLY DAMN SHIT!!!

&lt;3
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIve been  saying this movie will be great due to its cast and director but I found this trailer a little underwhelming if im honest
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks as though Matthew Vaughn has brought the greatness back to the X-Men flicks
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaThe one thing that looks great is the Magneto and Professor story. Both look like they are going to give decent preformances and that last shot of Erik taking on a on a sub looks epic. 
That might be the only part of this movie that will be redeeming, the rest kinda looks like too much teen angst was cramed in to every character 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaWOW, this actually looks great! I have hope again!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitahomg homg homg. &lt;3
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks outstanding.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaWaaaahhhhh! I want it NOW! Why do I have to wait? I don&#39;t like waiting? Gimme! Gimme!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI JUST MADE BUKKAKE ALL OVER MYSELF!!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks a lot better than I thought it would be.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!!! I got goosebumps
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaDear Marvel; DO NOT SCREW THIS UP!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIt actually doesn&#39;t look like total shit.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIt looks bad not as bad as i thought it would but still not great.
It needs Scott and Jean. 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitait dosen&#39;t look that impressive to me
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitabetter than x men 3 ... ^^&#39;
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitawhen&#39;s Frank West gonna be revealed???
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pretty excited. I did not like the part with Mystique though. The effects of her change didn&#39;t seem really natural. Small complaint though.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaPOW BOOM BAM !!!!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitabeast looks beast!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaInitially I don&#39;t think this movie will suck, but the trailer seems weak.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitalooks good... but it would be better if they had Storm in it. :-/
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaMAG-FUCKIN-NETO

HE SO PRINGLES
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaLooks a lil better than i was expecting(WAS EXPECTING 2 BE HORSESHIT) but still..... it could suck.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitalooks okay. i hope matt vaughn pulls it off
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to watch this for January Jones and January Jones alone.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaooooh this looks nice!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaAlright, now THAT is how you do an X-men movie.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaMag-fucking-neto
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaFuck me with an umbrella! This actually looks pretty bad ass!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaThis LOOKS AWESOME!!! :)
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitanot sure if this looks bad ass or a little too teen angsty...  good cast of characters though.  
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaAllison Haislip sent me.
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaBadass!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaWas that fucking WESLEY !?!??! He&#39;s bending minds and bullets! Watch out! Seeing this first day
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaIt was worth the wait! Looks awesome!!!
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitathis looks promising. 
UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaSo far so good. Just might go and see this.

UrbHykKUfTMdelimeterByIshitaFIRST!

gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI saw it the other day it&#39;s actually very good bit so much gruesome as I thought. Super good twist that&#39;ll get ya😏
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaif you want to spoil someone&#39;s night...recommend them this movie ... wtf this french oppsesion with eating flash? first &quot;&quot;dans ma peau&quot;....now this ...
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThis is pure nastiness
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSame old sexist shit. All male victims. And slaughtered by females. That feeds that fetish as well. Typical.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaet ils appelle ça un film gore de la daube sans nom désolés mais c&#39;est naze
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaDid the trailer just gave all the plot /movie?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaJust saw the whole film in the trailer minus whatever avant garde filler made up the rest of this movie
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitayuck,cannibals
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaComing of age is a theme in the movie, not what actually happens in the movie. That&#39;s the beauty of a great film, the subtle meanings and symbols behind the plot.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name song?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaOh god!
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThat last scene omg
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitatf is this movie
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaHow scary is this movie? I&#39;m really intrigued but I scare so easily and am really prone to nightmares and vivid fantasizing while getting myself scared, I can&#39;t handle scary monsters or  persons trying to kill you (like the Grudge or the Ring)
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaKIEDY TO BĘDZIE W KINACH
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI AM <b>SHOOK</b>
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I watch this!?!?!?!?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshita这也太变态了吧！<br>不过我喜欢！
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSuch a good film, I can&#39;t explain it... Just watch it!
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaCan someone please give me a link to watch or download this movie?!
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitai saw the movie today and all the interesting parts are in this trailer, i was very disappointed
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the song was called when all the rookies get thrown into their first party? When Justine is just walking around not having a clue what just happened?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitarip off
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI remember my first year in vet school.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaCall me crazy but I want to see this, where can I find it
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaPupa xD
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaAnother BS film just for vomiting out loud
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitamaybe she&#39;s allergic to meat
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSo I hear people are passing out because of this trailer.<br><br><br>They are weak humans and don&#39;t deserve to breed and contaminate future bloodlines.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitafoi legal gostei
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaIt was an amazing film 10000 times more woke than Get Out. 8/10
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitacannibal cult aka democrats
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaso basically tokyo ghoul in real life
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSucks
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSatanism is being introduced for some time now, so cannibalism fits the whole scene of the &quot;new man&quot; without boundaries.. I simply do NOT belong here!
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitawell i can imagine why some people going to see it have thrown up or passed out...that must be five times more fucked up in the actual movie
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaits disgusting. Who wants to See this film, somebody stupid
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaAfter the LGBT propaganda is done this is what will come next.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThis Bitch is a Fucking Ghaol
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSo nobody in the comments seems to have seen the movie.<br>Don&#39;t listen to people talking about &quot;cult of cannibalism&quot;, or &quot;shitty&quot; &quot;pointless&quot; movie. It&#39;s nothing like that.<br>This is one of the most powerful and beautiful movie I&#39;ve seen in my life. Incredible.<br>Go see it and make your own opinion.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI pay cinema for that kind of movies, uncomon movies ^^.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaYay, another shit wannabe shocker noone will remember
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSomeone know where I can find the soundtrack, theme of the movie ?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaimagine if gordon ramsay is going to watch this
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaeverything you see and hear in movies,tv shows and music are conditioning.<br>this is conditioning to accept cannibalism.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhere can we get this soundtrack!???
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSeems interesting
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWTF?  How can so many people give this a thumbs up.  You are some sick animals
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaamazing
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer has made me so confused
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitacan anyone tell me the name of the song, please?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so shitty lmao the fuck
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhats with the ichyness?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshita🙈
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with that Hawaiian Punch &quot;blood&quot; on the white clad people? I&#39;ve been covered in blood while wearing light clothing (an injury) and it looked nothing like that. It&#39;s way too pink. Anyway, it&#39;s not bad at all. I&#39;ve seen a lot worse. Methinks viral marketing is at play. It&#39;s being marketed as a movie so volatile and gross that you have to see it.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitayall are pussies if yall vomited while watching this. all that happened was she ate meat? 😂
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitai will not watch this garbage movie 1 dislike from me

gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaOK OK?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaaburrida para mí,😒 no tiene nada de terror, solo es gore( porque se ve comer carne cruda de personas y mucha sangre)  pera los carnívoros eso es normal😏.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaKinda weird and nasty.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaTanta coisa pra fazer filme e os caras vão fazer logo sobre canibalismo, não de atenção a essas merda, kkkkk teve gente desmaiando por causa dessa bosta Mano isso que é pior
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWeiiiird.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaTokyo Ghoul copy?????
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitabueno dicen que los vegetarianos sufren problemas de salud y tienen mucha deficiencia de hierro, si a eso le sumas la pinta de loca de la chica ya podemos imaginar como acabara tanto tiempo en abstinencia y de pronto le dan a comer carne y de paso cruda, aunque cabe preguntarse si la única loca era ella, porque esos juegos sádicos de fraternidades universitarias siempre han existido y a saber cuantas barbaridades harán sin que la sociedad real haga algo al respecto.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaummm... doesn&#39;t look too disturbing
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitano entendí pero weno
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSo is this one of those confusing pointless artsy movies that only the guy who wrote it gets it?
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaTampoco da taaaanto pánico,  me late que es una caquita
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaWhy does she have to eat the raw meat at the beginning..? 😂
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSo this is the trailer that&#39;s making people pass out and vomit after watching it. It looks like shit
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaOne more talentless milenial generation bullshit. 2017 &quot;These kid&#39;s are still getting stupider!&quot;
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaIf this was accurate, it would be set in Sub-Saharan Africa or some other tropical area, where cannibalism is still the norm not in cheese and butter eating France.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshita@ vc FC c 444
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI was expecting the trailer to be much worse
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI was told that this trailer made a lot of viewers vomit... <br>but... it&#39;s not bad at all .__. <br><br>IVE BEEN LIED TO
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! I hope it&#39;s worth all the hype.<br>Keep in mind people were vomiting and leaving when THE EXORCIST first came out....
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaFucking vegans
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshita&quot;Coming of age&quot;? Yes, I do remember experiencing all of these things when I was a teenager.
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitaSo THAT&#39;S what happened to Eleven.  Didn&#39;t see that coming...
gFlXVX2af_YdelimeterByIshitavery nice

2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaawsome looking movie. i found out that this was going to be made into a movie a few months ago, and i read a review of the comic. so, unfortunatly, i think i konw how it ends. but the movie still looks kickass (no pun intended)
2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaThis will be 2010&#39;s Zombieland.

2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaAre you kidding me only one part sounds like The Misfits and that&#39;s the part where they jump out the burning building at  2:04 seriously listen to &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; by the misfit&#39;s and then play that part and about The Ramones 2:14 sounds like them
2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaNucking Futts
2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaim gonna wear my green man suit and watch this.
2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitasurprisingly, this movie is based off a comic that was made in 2008. and from what i saw its actually kind of a dark comic. definately looking forward to this flick.

2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaDont B-Movies usually have B-actors and dont make theatres because of low budget? I mean no offense at all but ya might wanna re-categorize your movies bro Nick Cage did get paid B-money to co-star.

2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaAfter watching the trailers, I want to see this movie.  Trailers can be misleading, of course, but &#39;Kick-Ass&#39; looks interesting.

Nicolas Cage needs this one to be good... he&#39;s had too many bad movies recently.  (Or maybe he&#39;s just lost it... anyone who names his kid Kal-El is a little wacky.)

2rpXHqnGDXodelimeterByIshitaNice
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAnother catastrophic movie about America? ...Seriously? It began to be boring a long time ago :|
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAll we had to do was follow the damn train!
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaDude...that wave!!
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaIf you think this can really happen, that the events in this trailer are realist and not hugely exaggerated, go hold your breath and count to 10,000.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaWhy is there tsunami headed inland? Shouldn&#39;t it head the other direction?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! The Rock is in the Fast &amp; Furious movies and now he&#39;s in a GTA movie!!! :D<br><br>Hey, <i>wait</i> a second! ...dafuq is this shit?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe there are people in the comments here saying this &#39;could happen&#39; and that this is &#39;real&#39;.<br><br>Yes, earthquakes are real. No, this kind of bullshit doesn&#39;t happen.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaHere we go with yet another &quot;2012&quot; disaster movie, oddly named after a Grand Theft Auto game from 2004 &quot;San Andreas&quot;
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23VflsU3kZE&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> SURFS UP DUDE!
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaNo lo he visto
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaBest comedy of 2015.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaIs this the sequel to 2012?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAm I really skipping through the trailer to see the good parts when the trailer IS the good parts?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaEven though this movie seems toooooooooooooooooooooooooooo over dramatic for me, because I mean it&#39;s Hollywood. But what scares me the most is that this can really happen. Not if but when.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaitll happen some day for real :/
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSpolier alert: This isnt gta 
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaYo this is cool and all i&#39;d definitely watch but i need that trailer song ya feel
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaBlah it doesn&#39;t even look that good tbh it feels like been there, seen that. 
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaReality Reversal via Fictionalization. Very Clever.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSounds like a reboot of 2012
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAll you had to do was sail over the damn tsunami CJ
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaJust saying, even if the Earth were to literally crack in half, gravity would just push it back into itself, the molten rock would combine, it would become a planet with a fault line running through it, and we would need to repair a bunch of roads. Not very climatic.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaThis never would of happened if CJ just followed the damn train.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSouthern Africa be sitting there drinking tea like &quot;Is there a problem?&quot;
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was a movie of GTA, instead its a reason not to move to LA, sorry but I&#39;m still moving there
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaWell, I am glad there is at least one non-white person representing the human population, and its Dwayne &#39;The Rock&#39; Johnson :)

23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: The Rock punches the ground and stops the earthquake.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaCGI to summer blockbusters is like autotune to rap songs lol  
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaCheat codes... a lot of cheat codes..
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitai hope The Rock says &#39;Get to the CHOPPA!&#39; in San Andreas
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should shake things up at the box office.

23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaso the first trailer I watched like 4 times straight. No joke. And was like holy shit. Just finished this trailer and i must of said oh shit at least eight times. 
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSong anyone?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaHey what&#39;s Rob Schneider doing? Here not the early 2000s.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaDwayne the rock Johnson will be playing an actual rock in this film.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaSeems like it will be a shit movie, but its a cool idea that all the boats are racing to get over the lip of the mega tsunami before it breaks.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaIf this is San Andreas, where&#39;s Carl &quot;CJ&quot; Johnson?
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaBOSS AS!!!!!
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaCome on CJ, the world is ending
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitait is like 2012 meets perfect storm. Really cannot blame Hollywood though. Ideas really are running out. Hard to think of something fresh without it getting a familiar feel from another movie.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAnother 2012/The Day After Tomorrow, No Thank You.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaPredictive Programming!!<br><br>Just another sign the &quot;San Andres Fault&quot; will break California apart soon.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awesome to me, i will definitely be seeing it.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another 2012. Over the top action that people shouldn&#39;t survive. I&#39;m not in. 
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaLook at all the awful actors
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaThe fault isn&#39;t in the ocean.....

23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t be as corny as 2012
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaFUK i thought is new GTA came out...
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaHahahaha I was laughing so hard when I seen them driving a boat up a huge ass wave. So stupid how they think you can really do that on that big of a wave. 
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like another generic natural disaster movie, lol, Rock, go back to wrestling, your acting it&#39;s really poor in Hollywood.
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaAssustador
23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaTrailey opens with a bitch full of obivous make-up. No Thank you. Another fucking cash-grab.

23VflsU3kZEdelimeterByIshitaWhere is CJ?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaAnd remember kids. Use condom.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIf there is no stupid giant monster, and it is more in the line of &#39;The Shining&#39; kind of demon shit, I&#39;m in.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaHearing good things....
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so fucking good
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaInteresting
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaCoscarelli vibes off of this--and that&#39;s a good thing.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThe music from 1.22 - 1.30 is awesome. Digging the 80s Nightmare on Elm St/Halloween vibes. Anyone know where I can get hold of the music? 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIf pewdiepie says it&#39;s scary, it&#39;s REALLY scary.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIm Here Because Pewds Tweeted He Saw This Movie... Anyone Else Came Here For That?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIt fucks you twice!
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaWatched this film on opening night, it was very disappointing, not at all scary, in any way shape or form. But it was odd, I left the cinema with so many unanswered questions, the plot was simple enough to understand but it went off in all directions towards the end and quite frankly I just didn&#39;t get it I&#39;m afraid.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so 80s and I love it. Reminds me of how &quot;The Guest&quot; (2014) had an 80s feel. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaShit movie i see this last night
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSHIITTTTTT this is a new version of AIDSSSS! Now we are soooo FUCKED LMAOOO
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaDisasterpeace / Rich Vreeland music is LOVE
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaI am looking forward to this film and been reading, just a little bit though as don&#39;t want to spoil, about it and it looks like a lot of fun.  But, if you want to see a damn good horror film about the horrors of sex, you need to see Contracted, co starring Caroline Williams.  One of those rare films that actually got under my skin!
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaQuiero verla.<br>
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs this supposed to be a metaphor for stds
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaanyone watched this and wanna give a rating? IMDB gave 7.4/10, that&#39;s almost as high as The Conjuring
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaDamn, man! That was really creepy when the thing came up behind her friend in the doorway.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitawell if the you get the demon and can pass it along through sex, then what&#39;s the problem to get rid of it really? especially since all teenagers these days fuck whatever moves.. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSlender?<br>
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaAfter this movie sales of durex are going to go through the roof lol
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaShe should of used a condom!!!!! Lol<br>This shit is gonna be crazy
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of a creepypasta i heard once. Seems like it&#39;ll be good :)
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitadope
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSo... a supernatural terminator?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck is this
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaawesome, does anyone know what the song is?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t this movie remind anyone else of the korean horror &quot;Someone Behind You&quot; ???
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Don&#39;t have sex, because you WILL get a demon and die! Don&#39;t have sex in the missionary position, don&#39;t have sex standing up, just don&#39;t do it, OK, promise? OK, now everybody take some rubbers.&quot;
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaOmg I want the song so bad :(
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaGotta love these low-budget horror flicks!
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks creepy and crazy as fuck.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaWhat are terrible STD
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs it coming out in america looks intense and pretty good
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaI can NOT wait to see this UGHHHHH RELEASE IT ALREADY
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSo is this movie a metaphor for herpes?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaobvious pass it to someone then kill them 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaincredible director 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaBOO!
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaA movie about STD : Sexually Transmitted Demon

HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaWorst STD ever. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSo all this fuss about getting crabs jeez just shave your pubes people..
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie really about STD&#39;s? 😂😂
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaSo... It&#39;s an STG? This is stupid. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m an old school horror snob. This looks and sounds awesome.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s the horror of STDs following her.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs &quot;It&quot; aids?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s gonna be f*ckin EPIC!

HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis was made about 500 feet from my house at least the car crash in the Felid was done right done the road. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a metaphor for STDs so use protection 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitarich vreeland is the composer but cant find the actual songs from this trailer. creepy yet insanely good music
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshita Well that looks terrifying
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs this really going to be a movie? And if so wouldn&#39;t they have to give some sort of ownership of the idea to Gavin Free?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A SNAIL.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaOne of Gavin&#39;s stupid hypothetical question has become a movie... I would have never suspected this.
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaIs this just as good (or better) than Babadook?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitathis looks actually horrifying
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaMusic of the trailer ?
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising. 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaWell that another movie on my to see list...

HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty good for a horror  film
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshita4 out of 10 IMDB Confirmed ! 
HkZYbOH0ujwdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks interesting and not stupid at all
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care how great this Fincher guy is supposed to be (I personally though that Benjamin Button was depressing and stupid but hey, that&#39;s just my opinion) the Swedish version cannot be outdone by Americans!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaWhy the heck did they set this in Europe if it&#39;s the American adaption?
When the French remade &quot;Tell No One&quot; they set it in France. Weird.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaWhats the song for this trailer starts at 0:46
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI hope they don&#39;t fuck the original version. I hope the remake will be better or at least as good as the Swedish one.

THE GIRL TRILOGY - AWESOME!!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaNever read the books, never watched the Swedish ones (never will, though I&#39;m not sure for the books), the girl looks freakishly amazing, and the movie is David Fincher&#39;s. I don&#39;t know how this can be bad in any way and I don&#39;t have an idea how will I survive until 21.12.  
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! I have all 3 of the Swedish adaptations but I&#39;m excited to see this one. Looks like its gonna be great!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@FrederikkeLykke The movie itself is based on a book, so it&#39;s not a remake, but an adaptation. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@FrederikkeLykke yeah i cant make a judgement on the last one, i haven&#39;t seen, it but i probably wont untill the new one has come out, if  the old one is really good i dont want to set my expectations to high and then be dissapointed with the new film.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@FrederikkeLykke yh it definatley will be, its directed by David Fincher, the man behind fight club, the social network, se7en, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, the guys a genius trust him he will make this amazing
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else excited about Julian Sands being in this?
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDrj the Swedish &quot;so-called&quot; adaptation was great and very true to the book. And Noomi Rapace did a wonderful job in the movie. Still, Fincher is one of my favourite directors, so I&#39;m looking forward to this.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s David Fincher.
It&#39;s incapable of sucking.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaOh shut up! Lisbeth Salander is Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace is Noomi Rapace. Rooney Mara is Rooney Mara. geddit?
But the American version of Lisbeth matches more closer to the novel than the Swedish version. Admit it ppl! Especially the ones who read the novels. Noomi&#39;s Lisbeth was too woman-ish and too hard. Lisbeth is suppose to look like a teenage boy and fragil figure. Plus, Lisbeth does have emotions. The Swedes portrayed her as a stoned hard face with no sense.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@jagelskarmcfly AGREED o.o  Noomi is the best!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@ThinkDeepThoughts @ThinkDeepThoughts First, I really must apologize that I accidently pressed the &quot;E&quot; buttom to quickly. Was it satisfying to reprimand me? Second, your argument that they speak with accents just because there are some Swedish actors in the movie falls on it&#39;s own absurdity, as we say here in Sweden. Third, the vast majority knows the language sure, that doesn&#39;t mean they use it. Fourth, oh really captain obvious? The accent sounds ridiculous in my opinion. Sorry.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj The hell she is.. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLocked room mystery.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLocked room mystery.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@viperxviperxviperxx First, it&#39;s spelled &quot;Swedes&quot;.  Second, a few of the actors in this movie are in fact Swedish.  Third, the vast majority of the Swedish population under 50-60 years old speaks English.  Most Swedish teenagers are actually quite fluent in the language.  Fourth, seeing as it takes place in Sweden, I suppose maybe the director wanted to highlight that fact by retaining the accents.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like they&#39;ve managed to maintain a Swedish atmosphere, and not just turned it into some Hollywood POS action crap.. Looking forward to seeing this.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer...very intriguing. Looks like a major hit movie...hope the other two books become movies too...but the &#39;rebel girl on the motorcycle&#39; thing is an overused movie/tv cliche...I&#39;m just saying...
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitathumbs up if you think this is the feel bad movie of christmas
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj actually, noomi rapace IS lisbeth salander.  the swedish versions were brilliant.  but this looks amazing too.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@WinterAffair  i suppose not. :p
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@erbabel several reasons. a) the swedish dubbed version blows, the subtitled version is better, b) the swedish version is a good film, but one that could have been better (and the subtitles are full of spelling/grammatical errors), c) the two sequels were sub-par, fincher would easily improve on those and finally d) this isn&#39;t a cash grab of a remake, this is Fincher&#39;s own vision, it&#39;s not been done just so people can have it in English
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@TheCarnage92 In Fincher we trust dumbass. I bet your swedish and pissed that he can do it better
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@fightinside1 That&#39;s Christopher Plummer. Max Von Sydow had to leave the project.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaThe lat time Craig told someone &quot;WE NEED TO TALK&quot;......they were limping.....
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@kaz1z1z I don&#39;t even think in the movie she is ugly, just different.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@dvibe Do you like Sweden? Cause I kind of wanna move there, or at least visit, but I wanna learn the language first.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited, Lisbeth Salander is my favorite character of all time, and to see her on the big screen will be magical.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaWhy are they speaking with accent? It´s not like sweeds speak english anyway. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj Fair comment. My single line was aimed more at those not in the know. (not read the book and/or seen the swedish film version) to give them a starting point as to what the film is about. On hind sight I dont think I did it that well. Taking an unbias look at the full trailer I think it is very intriguing but is also dark and foreboding in the way it hints at underlying tones but at the same time should draw the person in making it a must view. I&#39;ll be going !!!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@nicknameanonymous I have read the Millenium Trilogy and they were excellent. Surprisingly enough I originally bought Dragon Tattoo as part of a 3 for 2 offer in waterstones. It was to make up the 3 books. I bought the other two as soon as I had finished it. I then watched the swedish films in the cinema. I think  this version will be more indepth as is given away in the trailers if you have read the books and watched the original movie. this version has a definate darker more sinister overtone.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaboy could there be a better trailer! i&#39;m freaking...IN!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitadepressing trailer...
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj 
Well, the budget for this movie is quite much higher than the swedish one, so it would be a scandal if it wasn&#39;t better :P

Although, as a swede, I must say that the swedish accent of the speech is a bit awkward.. :D
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@Makilore 
You clearly haven&#39;t read the books properly, because it&#39;s clear she&#39;s not supposed to be an ugly girl if you read it..

DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita&lt;3 Trent
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLooks fuckin&#39; amazing...
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj No, that&#39;s fair enough. It was definitely strange when I heard Fincher was so quick to remake the books so soon after the first films, because someone had already created the two main characters visually for me.

I didn&#39;t notice anything about the Swedish movies that felt cheap or made-for-tv about them, but I can see why so many people didn&#39;t like them in comparison to the books and the characters. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@MadonnasMrDj From what I&#39;ve seen, yes, this actress is more like the Lisbeth from the books, but I still view Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth. The visual image is pretty much burnt in by now, as I loved her in the first adaptations. And they were good movies, very good even. But whether they turn out to be lesser than Fincher&#39;s take, we&#39;ll see. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaTo me this is not a remake,more like an english adaption and expansion of the swedish original.
Yes, the full trailer gives away too much. It should have concentrated on the main plot line. Which is - 
What happened to Harriet Vanger ?
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita3 minutes trailer:|
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@j7wild well then read the book, and then watch the films. They are still one of the best....
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaread the book, love it and this movie seems to do it justice, judging from this trailer. can&#39;t wait to watch it! 

DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitainterested to see if the remake is as good a remake as Let me In
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitalol at people who think theyre so much smarter than everyone else because they think the original one is better... even though they havent even seen this film yet
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it&#39;s going to be one hell of a roller coaster.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLisbeth isn&#39;t supposed to be pretty!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI was ready to blast this because I hate remakes, but this looks genuinely really good.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@StrawhatLeo Its resolved in this film.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI like how he says Mikael Blomquist&#39;s name like it was eastern european - Michail or however they spell it. It&#39;s pronounced Mikel, close to Michael
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita1:22 stockholm =)
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@QUESTKONSUMPTION 

Who cares how attractive the actress appears in the trailer!? The greatest asset of the first was definitely Noomi Rapace, in fact she was the ONLY good thing about that one. The book was nothing special, and it looks like neither will be this possibly more faithful adaptation.
One big non-starter. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@Makilore well she&#39;s not ugly, just not Hollywood pretty
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@Makilore The actress is actually really pretty.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@j7wild looks like the same Swedish version, just in English now.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FUCK THATS THE LONGEST TRAILER I HAVE EVER SEEN. fuck caps..
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitafincher&#39;s done it again!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@JoakimJohnsson Exactly!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@gatomjp The payoff is greater when people see what they haven&#39;t seen before, rather than seeing what&#39;s already been shown to them. On a personal level, they showed too much.........even though I&#39;ve read the books, and seen the original movies.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitala concha de la lora
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@BSUR25 Yes. You sure watch too many movies, so I suggest u read the book first, this time, buddy. But nice try.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaEveryone who&#39;s saying that the Rooney-Lizbeth is as ugly as fvck and is shittier looking than the Noomi-Lizbeth only proves that the American version&#39;s pulled it off—physically—better than the first one. Isn&#39;t that the point to Sally&#39;s appearance??

And, come on. It&#39;s not about who does it first, but who who does it better. So I really hope everyone else who talks shit would just stfu and wait and watch. U can do all the shit talking later—if u think, after viewing, it still deserves it right.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI dont know about you guys but having an amazing cast do the acting with david fincher (who got his oscar stolen from hooper) doing the directing and Trent Reznor doing the score makes me want to wait at the movie line for the film. NOW!!!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaOkay Fincher, you got me.....
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@BSUR25 Except the girl that they&#39;re looking for disappeared in 1966.  Lisbeth wasn&#39;t even born then.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaSo for those of us that think!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@BSUR25 The girl that got killed was murdered forty years before the story starts, and in the book, I think Lisbeth is in her twenties.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaHarriet and Lisbeth are so ugly in the remake - they are beautiful in the original. I guess they wanted to avoid the hollywood stamp. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitai think that the girl that there looking for that died is the girl with the dragon tatto if im right dam i watch 2 many movies
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaIf anyone can pull off an awesome American adaptation...it&#39;s fucking David Fincher with Trent Reznor with a kickass soundtrack.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@j7wild the swedish version was completely faithful to the book
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaThe two girls really make this difference here for me. This one looks like she can act, but not as good as the Swedish one. Also this one is so unattractive it hurts. 

This made me realize how good the Swedish film of the book was. Also were they adapting the book or fucking Swedish movie? Everything is the same!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaRooney Mara is looking fine!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitacompare to swedish version everything looks good besides lizbett

DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaCool, now I don&#39;t need to watch it, just saw the entire movie in this trailer.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitalol iv already seen this movie
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@aggelikiee I&#39;m sure you can discern all that of from the trailer haha...
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaShe can not pull off the look. Sorry hunny but the swedish version is way better :P
Gotta say...though I&#39;l see this just for the hell of it. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitalooks good
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI think I prefer the Swedish version.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@nur12100 You&#39;re not suppose to.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaYou know, I LIKE the girl&#39;s look.  She doesn&#39;t HAVE to be pretty to be a good investigator.  Plus an awkward looking girl who&#39;s awkward with people makes more sense then a good looking girl.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@aggelikiee ...You havnt even seen this version yet
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@flipjack42 So more people will watch it. Not everyone can speak Swedish, or enjoys reading subtitles while trying to watch a movie.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI like that if you&#39;ve seen the other movie or read the book at 1:11 you can see the guy who did it standing in the background. Whoops. Spoilers. =P
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaWhy the F***K do they have to remake movies especially international ones. This is bullshit
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitagunna be some long ass movie
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@j7wild  Funny, every scene in this trailer are also in the swedish version. Please explain more thoroughly how you can see that in a 3:50 trailer.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitalooks good
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshita@peteagassi Michael Bay may have some stuff to entertain you that wont make you think so gosh darn hard. Lots of guns and explosions, and shiny stuff!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like this girl(( 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaThis showed way too much.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaLooks hella boring. 
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitawow, looks awesome!!
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaGood thing I saw the previous movie. Cause that trailer showed just about all of it.
DqQe3OrsMKIdelimeterByIshitaTHE LONGEST MOVIE TRAILER I&#39;VE EVER SEEN.

96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitahow to basic is it you?
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaOh man, this game looks great. I don&#39;t know how they managed to make the graphics so realistic, too! Will it be available on Steam or just consoles? Though I don&#39;t know, it looks like a pretty linear game with set pieces. I do love that Head Shake technology, though. I wonder if your head shaking will affect the storyline.<br><br>So yeah, lemme know where I can pre-order this, eh? Especially if it comes with some DLC!
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaTIM FOCKIN ROTH!!!!!! HELL YEAH
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaMakes me think of the Peep Show gone into science fiction.

96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaI have nothing against Queen, but this overused song in this trailer makes me cringe. Been waiting for the film ever since Bad Motherfucker video came out, that was so awesome. Now that&#39;s just bad music choice. But still so happy that guys finally made it to big screens.
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaCall of Duty finally invaded the art of cinema. I just heard Kubrick and Kurosawa grave roll in unison. Fuck. This. Shit.
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AMAZING
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaBiting Elbows
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaБред какой то, уже под англо-саксов фильм начали сливать, при чем тут Генри? Начальный замысел был совершенно другой, а тут видим что хотят срубить бабла на западном рынке. Не могли поставить нормального славянского героя? Короче фильм подавал много надежд,но теперь скатился к трешаку(
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaFucking yes.  Looks cheesy in the best way!
96EChBYVFhUdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks like a trailer for a way to realistic video game! =D

IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitapure sht
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaDamn. From which cow farm did they get to make all this cheese?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWow, Egyptian Gods with English accents... brilliant :) The special effects, the costumes, all look horrendous. I don&#39;t know how, but it looks worse than Clash of the Titans... amazing.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaIs that Apophis at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJBnK2wNQSo&amp;t=1m48s">1:48</a>?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaidc, I&#39;ll be watching.<br>I&#39;m into this shit.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLol Crazy Christians in the comments. As a Pagan, I also have to sigh at the demonizaition of Set. But then again, He WAS demonized in history, and still is demonized, so... yeah. Fun fact, Set was originally worshipped as the other Gods were, before He was cast as evil by the Christians, Greeks and Romans, that is.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaso ... clash of the titans : egypt operations ??
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJBnK2wNQSo&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a> dead men are still men
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitabehold, the next Legend of Hercules
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitadid I just saw illidan stormrage
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaJoking aside, it looks like it could be a fun popcorn flick.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaOP
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaJesus
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitawhat a load of shit.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitashould&#39;ve just made an immortals 2.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaCGI: The movie
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll be a great movie, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fun to watch.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s a Lannister doing in this movie? Go back to Kings landing!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTerrible CGI
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaIt looks beautiful! Such a shame at the whitewashed casting. Is it really that hard to find suitably talented, ethnically-accurate actors Hollywood?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitathis looks visually stunning. And really there are people expecting any sort of realism on a fully fantasy film? This was a missed opportunity to more diversity but it is not required for this movie. it should be here yeah but if the end product looks good, then all fine.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThe costumes and sets (which are all poorly done cgi) aren&#39;t reminiscent at all of ancient Egyptian culture - it just looks like a generic fantasy world.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaI let Exodus of Gods and kings get away with having no main black stars but this is ridiculous. For god sake Egypt is in Northern Africa why are none of your cast members black the Egyptian people have color!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLOL. I have a suggestion for a sequel. Gods of India, and Gods of China, with the same Main cast.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis seems worse than Clash of the Titans...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS. IS. PISH!!!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaAt fist i was all &quot; Oh cool another 300 esk movie&quot;<br>Then i was all &quot; Flush&quot;
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshita5% metascore
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWow, just wow, that green screen is awful. Like I have never seen a movie where I can&#39;t tell that they are in front of a green screen. Where the filmmakers even trying?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaIt does look fancy...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaIs it me or do they not look very Egyptian?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaAlex Proyas really disappoints me for making this piece of shit full of hollywood manner of converting mythology into pathetic feast of fake cgi...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaomg this looks weird btw last joke was actually funny
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaI like the idea but the execution looks terrible.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaAlex Proyas is directing, Gerard Butler is the bad guy, looked amazing on paper, then I watched this trailer...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaSmiteplayers are gonna love this.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitawho else is hoping for box office bomb
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhat a career, Gerard Butler.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaClash of the immortal gods of whitewashed Egypt. <br>Now with bad cgi
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS.IS.SHIT
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;ll be on the same level as Pompeii (2014). Blimey.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaGonna be riddled with anti white propaganda
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis could have been the Kane Cronicles movie
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaFrom the producers: The demon and the evil cobra were black. So shut up.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaHopefully this is better than Immortals
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhat is this shit?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaI wonder how long it will take for terrorists to start comment here
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS SPAR.....EGYP.....SHIT
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitacoooo
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitawhat the heck was that? I&#39;m not even upset at the white washing. I am just legitimately confused as to what the heck that was.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitatake my money
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhat a waste of money, give me all the money they invested in this movie and even I could make a better one. ffs
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaGod of war , please!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLove how everyone is a film critic...jesus christ, its a action movie... just go watch it and enjoy the cool GCI. If you honestly think hollywood will ever care about details(white actors playing northern african gods) then you are in denial. I&#39;m shocked people keep thinking this will change.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaladies and gentleman... I present you&#39;re next box office bomb
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhat ungodly creation is this!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLeonidas in the ancient Egyptian empire
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaAll this noise and its just another Clash of the Titans, and nobody cared about that.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaif you look very closely you will see some visual effects done by computer
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis could either be one of the greatest films ever, or it could be the end of Jamie Lannister.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitathis looks fucken amazing
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEgyptOfficial? please change this.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEgypt with white people, that&#39;s historically correct, but we should let Hollywood to fantasize!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJBnK2wNQSo&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a> uhhhh call kratos, he&#39;s available
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEgypt with white people, that&#39;s historically correct, but we should let Hollywood to fantasize!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS EGYYYYPPPTTTTTT!!!!!!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEgypt with that color ratio??? comedy
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitathis movie looks AMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitacgi no story
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaomg , ppl complaining about the actors being white and all the SF stuff, ffs its a movie , its fantasy not a documentary
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitapoor  Gerard Butler this isn&#39;t gonna do well for his career.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaYOU ARE NOT PREPARED!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLOOKS LIKE FUN!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaok , im in
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitawow the acting is soo off and the green screen effect is soo noticable. This looks like a cluserfuck. What is this movie trying to be?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis looks ... terrible ..
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaWhitewashing blablabla....whatever.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEfeitos mal feitos.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaMight get more views if Nikolaj was mentioned in the title!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaAnd the Oscar for the Most shit film of the year goes to...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaFirst movie he won&#39;t die in?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS. IS. EGYPT!!!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitalooks like a porn movie with perfect snakes!   on the stage.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaJesus is God.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaGods of Kemet you mean?
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Clash and Wrath of the Titans, which is bad sign.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaouhh forgot that space
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaLooks incredibly stupid, but fun.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshita[Gods of Egypt : 80% of cast is white]   ....seems legit.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaso... the Egyptian pantheon is... white.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitagods of Egypt with white people only now thats a joke
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaOh, not like this didn&#39;t spoil the movie...
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS EGYPT !!!!
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitalooks shit.
IJBnK2wNQSodelimeterByIshitaEgypt Has Fallen

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaHas there been any news of an expected release date?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaPlease what the music at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a> ?

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know corey feldman had a sex and race change
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty bad
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaMore sex, drugs, teen spirit, and partying. <br>More sellout bullshit.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaLooks ok, although at little familiar.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is not for these gullible reckless ass millenials. These people obviously love disorder. Kill it with fire!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaBLARGH  I hate &quot;youth&quot; films.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitai have a feeling someone will die at the end and ps: why shia leabeaouf always angry in the movies?

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaTumblr: The Movie
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaSo Shia Labouf is in movies again....
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of Spring Breakers
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshita~RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE FROM SHIA LA BEOUF~
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaRAURY
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaPass. This movie should be called tumblr.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaIs that Zoe Kravitz or Jaden Smith?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaOMG I just realised it&#39;s Shia Labouf in the last shot lol!!!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI just love movies that start with American! History X, POP,  Beauty, Psycho, Gangster, Graffiti, President, Werewolf in London, and soon, I&#39;ll add Honey to my list.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaNice aspect ratio
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t feel the spirit~ Someone can show it to me?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaomg this looks amazing!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaanyone who wants to understand real America culture, watch this movie. The vast majority of the people in this country are like this
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaa24 does it once more!!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for it
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaVery excited for this - the short film, Wasp, is something special :)
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaIt was an amazing movie. Can confirm.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI got incredibly excited when Raury started playing
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI can already tell this movie is just going to depress me.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaDid one of the critics use the word &quot;optimistic&quot; to describe this movie?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaFinally!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Spring Breakers meets Thelma and Louise directed by Terrence Malick, with Shia LaBoots thrown in for good measure.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitapromoting lifestyles like this is what&#39;s wrong with america.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaNo way! Not ANOTHER movie about sex, drugs, alcohol, violence and social irresponsibility!! Who could have imagined?!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaTHIS! IS! BULLSHIT!!
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaits like that KIDS movie from the 90&#39;s
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitawowza. is she a prost?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitamore weird youth movies
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if Shia was doing all his antics to get into the role for this? Phoenix rapping type thing.

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaPeople! the second song of the trailer is Raury&#39;s song, God&#39;s Whisper &amp; you&#39;re welcome. :D

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Honey....... Go Riley Keough, Sasha Lane......✌❤♊💯🔥⭐✔
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a sequel to Harmony Korine&#39;s Spring Breakers, don&#39;t know if that is a good thing....
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song that starts on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SpWZm1PLc&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a>
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the second song?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaShia the fricken beef.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaGuess we can all say Shia is back on track!! What a brilliant trailer, looking forward to the movie big time ! Amazing music during the trailer as well
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaso thrilled about American Honey<br>in love with Andrea Arnold since Cannes 2016, can&#39;t wait to see what it seems to be a masterpiece
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaAmerican Honey a.k.a Shia LaBeouf and His Drugged Up White Friends of Today&#39;s Generation Who Yell Out Rap Lyrics
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaRiley FUCKING Keough<br><br>work it, girl

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaCarnage - &quot;I Like Tuh Feat. ILoveMakonnen&quot; (Official Music Video) is the song
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a modern &quot;Easy Rider&quot;
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaWhat a bunch of wank
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song towards the end?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaWow this looks amazing.

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaA24 KILLIN&#39; IT
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaWhat a bunch of garbage! People are going to pay real money to watch this, but thankfully not very many.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaSong?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaIf anything, this is the return of ANDREA ARNOLD! So much love and respect for her :-)
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaDamn A24 is losing it
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaOMG ZE RETURN OF SHHHHHHIIIIIIAAAAAAAAA
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like Spring Breakers directed by David Gordon Green.

y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaSUCH A GREAT FILM
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaDamn.<br><br>When can I buy my tickets?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaJUST DO IT
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the name of the two songs in the trailer?
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I just watched the whole movie.
y1SpWZm1PLcdelimeterByIshitaAs much as I like the intimacy that comes from the 4:3 ratio, I&#39;m disappointed that those beautiful landscapes aren&#39;t shown off in full widescreen.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitathis was a horrible movie
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI just watched it yesterday. Such a unique movie. Funny, but also very dark at times. I highly recommend watching it but keep your expectations low.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaA24 Has never let me down so far.<br>Their films are a breath of fresh air.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis really looks like it&#39;s directed by Martin McDonagh
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWtf.  What kinda of drugs was the writer on?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely loved AND hated this movie. Just squirmy difficult and uproariously funny. Going to see it again this weekend.  I think it is something you HAVE to experience. Two thoughts - It is  Moonrise Kingdom on acid. And, you can&#39;t unsee it. <br>\
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitai am so confused
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks very strange and unfunny.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so bad, sort of dark and sinister. Don&#39;t recommend it.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis is a ugly, sadistic and ugly movie. The director should be buried alive. It would not surprise me if he tortures little animals.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the name of the song that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> <br><br>BTW I believe it was lobsters who are biology immortal. So the protagonist has more than enough time to find someone.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitawhy isnt there a bisexual option though????????? srs
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI wanna know the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=1m07s">1:07</a>!<br>Also what the heck is this story supposed to be?! It&#39;s so confusing but I really really am intrigued
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaSong name? I think it&#39;s Maria Callas but I can&#39;t find the song.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitawhat is Steve Brule doing in this film???
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie yesterday, it was fantastic. It was perfectly weird, awkward and funny. I love the director&#39;s other two films and this is his most enjoyable yet. Still might not be for everyone but it&#39;s still worth seeing at least once.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitacan someone give me the song that&#39;s in the latter half of this trailer
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI probably would&#39;ve picked an octopus to get turned into, for personal reasons
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s annoying how &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;most original&quot; movies only feature cisgendered white people in hetero relationships.... Like, how clever or original can you get when you refuse to have diversity??
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why films this beautiful, this clever, and this engaging don&#39;t employ more POC on screen -- even as extras? This all-white (or mostly-white) space is tiresome.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitawtf
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWtf did I just saw, too much to understand
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t skip this ad; glad I didn&#39;t.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaLooks clever.   If you want to see another Love Story Like No Other watch &#39;Metro Manila&#39; <br>    The movie is amazing
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaa greek song!
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitais there any plan to show it in Monterrey, Mexico?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis was one of the weirdest movies I&#39;ve encountered. But I love it! :)
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song used
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaExcuse me? XP I&#39;ll be honest, I am intrigued. Even if it does look a bit pretentious based on this trailer. haha
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredibly amusing.<br>May have to be on the lookout for this one.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song  that plays at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> woman singer maybe Italian please tell me
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita<b>130th comment</b><br>I would have chosen a wolf.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitareminds me of the greek goddess i think it&#39;s circe that turns people into animals
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaso if he dosnt fall in love as a human he turns into an animal? I would go there to turn into an animal, probably a dog
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaAt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> it sounds like JackFrags
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitathis looks good
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis came up as an add, and I have to admit I&#39;m intrigued. This sounds so odd that I want to see it just because I&#39;ve never heard of anything like it. But why a lobster? I&#39;d pick either a penguin or a house cat.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita&quot;If you fail to fall in love, you will turn into an animal&quot;<br>&quot;Any romantic or sexual behavior will be punished&quot;<br>The trailer can&#39;t even pretend that this is consistent.<br>Unless the peopel running the service are evil and the confusion is supposed to make me want to see the movie?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaInteresting
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaNot sure about this one. It was shit, but good. Like really shit, but really good. Hm.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaYa know...this is type of &quot;art&quot; is a total buzz kill.  It&#39;s like being ironic to be ironic.  True art is about honesty.  There&#39;s not a single frame of honesty.  There&#39;s more vanity and falseness in this than an episode of The Kardashians.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d go there just to become a wolf or a German Shepherd haha
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaDamn it Ryoma
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitathis already came out, I don&#39;t get it
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitalobsters are immortal ;3
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was another Daniel Radcliffe/Justin Long Body Horror movie. Was not disappointed.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI have discovered this channel and now I&#39;m never looking back.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaYORGOS? xD Greek names in english tho &lt;3 &lt;3
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWant to make no money at the box office?  Name your movie, The Lobster.  Cute and witty makes busts at the box office.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaPretty good, thought-provoking flick. If you&#39;re a loner, this movie will be more validating than depressing for you.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita&quot;A lobster is an excellent choice&quot; best thing ever said
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaum.....what?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita&quot;Her&quot; (concepts of loneliness and modern take on love) meets &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (taking on animal/insect shaping) meets grim humor of Kurt Vonnegut...
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaGreat film.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaGreat film
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWait, so he could turn into ANY animal, and he chooses a lobster? Why not a lion or something cool, a lobster?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve stayed in the hotel
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitagreat movie
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitayou have my attention... can i have your torrent??? <br><br>I&#39;m kidding, I don&#39;t do torrents... <br><br>torrents are horrible things...
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thinks a24 is shit? (based off thier trailers. And the premise of thier movies)
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaso....I&#39;ve already seen this...? I&#39;ve watched this movie, and until now I thought it had alreafy been released....because I&#39;ve seen it....I&#39;m very confused.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitacrap
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitathe future is an autistic place
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s your lobster
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI couldn&#39;t finish it. It&#39;s supposed to be some kind of parody, but it stopped being funny even before half way through it. I don&#39;t know if it was trying to be deep but...wasn&#39;t very clear what it was trying to do. Boring.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks quirky and good but seriously tried too hard to be weird and got from ok to seriously boring half way through, 100% Do NOT WATCH
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s his lobster!
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaName of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a>
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitawhy don&#39;t people lie and pretend to be mates to avoid being turn into an animal (I have not seen the movie)
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita<b>Why not Zoidberg?</b>
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaMore Original than Swiss army Man?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI saw it, it&#39;s surrealistic and people act a little robotic. I liked it, it was original and by stripping away &quot;normal human behaviour&quot; it actually highlighted teh way we act. At least that was just my take :)
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI would go with squirrel
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaNogla!!
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis Is Like Hell... For Single People! :o
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaFlanders........?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best movie of 2015, I highly reccommend
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitait appears that how we define love is becoming more insane with each and every silly movie being made
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWTF are people running out of ideas for movies.. this is the shit that&#39;s literally coming out now
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaFascinating.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI wanna be a TOASTER!
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitasaw this ages ago in australia aha
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThis sounds amazing.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita&quot;He&#39;s her lobster!&quot; ;)
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita...the freaking heck? <br><br>I want to see this, but I have no idea why.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaI saw this.  It was literally one of the shittiest movies I&#39;ve seen in the last year.  It&#39;s in the categories of awful movies that exist solely to give self proclaimed film critics something to drool over.  Oh the noir of it all it&#39;s such a vivid reflection of the horrors of love in a dystopian society <b>cums all over himself</b>
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita.... This seems so original... like wow. Must see it
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNZmOJxuAc&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a> Is that a stepbrothers reference?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s with all these neat films from A24?
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThought that was David Tennant from the thumbnail
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaHarry Potter died??? :o
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks interesting but I gotta disagree with the &quot;The year&#39;s most original film...&quot; after just watching the trailer for &quot;Swiss Army Man&quot;.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaiF you don&#39;t find love you&#39;ll turn into an animal.<br><br><br>Uhhhh what???
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaRule of A24: all films must be put through an instagram filter
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaكولين فاريل 👍😘
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaIf Donald Trump wins the Election.&gt;&gt; Give Colin Farrell an OSCAR 2017
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaThe original trailer was better but this one does a great job esposing the weird and unsettling nature of the movie. Go see it !
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaA24 puts out better films that most major studios.
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaA24 can do no wrong
LTNZmOJxuAcdelimeterByIshitaMay 2016 in the US. Huh I saw this one a few months back here in Australia. <br><br>GO SEE IT.

0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so bloody good! So glad Will Poulter got this rolee!! 
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshita It looks interesting and genuinely funny. Good.

0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaThanks for taking the time out of your day to tell people you&#39;ve never met that a film you&#39;ve never seen is dumb. I&#39;d hazard a guess you don&#39;t see the irony. 
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaWhy do you have a avatar of Superman Henry Cavill?

0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaI also appreciated Aniston yelling, &quot;THE BIG BLACK PENIS!&quot;
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaI only know two of the songs in this trailer. What are the rest of them? I only know TLC and Mickey Avalon. Anyone know the rest please? :3
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaLooks funny as hell
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitalol
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaTLC - Waterfalls 


0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaThe singing at the end is the only thing that made me laugh. I think it will be a good movie, but I can wait for it to come out on DVD to watch it.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaThat last part
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaOh.... That&#39;s your Mother ! . =) 
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so funny! it must be better than the trailer right? 

0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaLOLOLOLOLOL 2:15
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaDammit superman,don&#39;t you have Zod to deal with?
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaBro, ppl like you dont get far cuz they judge before trying. This movie looks good and funny. Sure JA&#39;s strip scene is why my dick told me to click this and why I like this movie so far, but still aside from that it looks like a great comedy.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaxD what song was he singing at the end!?
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaLOL this seems like its gunna be a HIT!!!
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaWat the fuck did i just watch
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaI love the concept, but I&#39;m not sure if I have as much affection towards the execution quite yet. I&#39;ll give it a view when it comes out though.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaI need to see this xD
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaWatching this just for Jennifer Aniston stripping.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaOh my god I have to see this. It looks hilarious! 
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaHilarious! I want to watch! Loll

0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;ve never touched another woman before&quot;
Me: Well, I guess Jennifer Aniston is a great place to start from. Go, you.

This does look funny, the stripper and the virgin are probably going to stand out.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t waittttttt  :)
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s like a fucked up little miss sunshine.
0Vsy5KzsieQdelimeterByIshitaso funny

mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaHonestly why does Mark Darcy like her anymore? He&#39;s had to fight for her 3 times now just because she can never decide between him and another guy jeez...
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaOMG THEIR NAMES ARE MARK AND JACK! DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW WHY I&#39;M HAPPY ABOUT THAT? ❤+💚????
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaAt least Hugh Grant escaped
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaCondoms people condoms!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaSo unprotected sex with two men in a small amount of time. Good message to send out?
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaSorry Patrick Dempsey, Colin Firth will always be the original McDreamy to me
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitafuck Patrick Dempsey !
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaAt her age the baby would probably be deformed
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaSoooo cute!!!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitathey all look so old
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitawoooo Patrick Dempsey!!! greys anatomy&lt;3
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sad but only because while I was watching this I remembered that scene where Darcy covers Bridget with his jacket when it was snowing.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLITTLE MIX
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitano tiene coherencia ellos parecen abuelos , briget ya paso la menopausia!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaimagine how much you can get with a vagina....
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitawho the hell is that?! that&#39;s not the Bridget Jones I know..   already not interested in watching. stupid plastic surgery

mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaDid no one in this movie hear of a paternity test?  Also, Colin Firth all the way.  It&#39;s not even a competition.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshita-Maury at the end of the movie: neither one of you is the father!!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaWho else literally almost fell asleep while watching this?

mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaJust here to dislike. I&#39;ll be on my way now.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitafuck you guys for making this, please come up with an origional stpry and idea. youre beating a dead horse with a stick. this is why indie movies are becoming more and more popular
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaeww...Patrick Dempsey
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitais competition by Little mix, this is so good. i love them LM. Jess Glynne, OMG.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaWhy does she look so old?
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaoh, yaaaaassssssss Patrick Dempsey
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLooks good I loved the original. Let&#39;s see if this be as good.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaMore like... Bridget Jones&#39;s New Eyelids
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaNice to see old actors back on a big screen
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Ed sheerans cameo seen? 😑😑😑
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaTHE FUCKING SONG OF LITTLE MIX ALDNSKWFDLDFDWXKDKDJDKSWDNDKS AAAAHHHG BYE
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaEd sheerans the father lol
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaPLOT TWIST: Bill Cosby&#39;s the father.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaShe has a comedy miscarage at the end. Spoiler alert!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaDerek stop cheating on a look-alike Meredith. And Shouldn&#39;t you be doing some brain surgery right now...Shame.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaMcdreamy
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist: She isn&#39;t pregnant, it&#39;s just an elaborate prank
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is this... she is like 80 years old
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitai remember that after a few months you can check the dna of the baby already,
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitathis is still going on.. even with the plastic surgery
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe how much they have aged. Wow..
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist: neither of them is the father.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry. Bridget has had over 15 years to get her shit together. I&#39;m not letting my wife drag me back into hell.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLove triangles have always been such a cheap attempt at a plot, but this film will be an actual huge disappointment if the kid isn&#39;t Marks or she doesn&#39;t end up with Mark. Two films about them two getting together, with the second one ending with them ENGAGED, and she ends up with another guy?!?! Don&#39;t even get me started on the fact that they broke Mark and Bridget up in the first place, just to continue this repetitive SL.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaCOLIN FIRTH looks daymmmmm sexy (as always)!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaTHE QUEENS LITTLE MIX&#39;S SONG IS IN THIS TRAILER
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this movie :)
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitashe&#39;s just so sexy.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaThe Wombats?
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaRIP Derek Shepard
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitawhat are the songs
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitalittle mix
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaSomeone&#39;s desperate for $$$
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaCompetition &lt;3
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLITTLE MIX OMFG ❤
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitalittle mix❤
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaHugh Grant, Colin Firth, now Patrick Dempsey?  Bridget Jones must have been a saint in her past life, goodness.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaWhat are you doing Derek you have Meredith you don&#39;t need her
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshita1, Looking at Bridget it looks like a different person. 2, Colin Firth looks too old for this now. 3, Bringing babies into the story is a recipe for a movie only catered for Mums. 4, Zero funny in the whole trailer. 5, This movie is not going to be anywhere near as good as the first two movies.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaI mean I love Bridget Jones, but I&#39;m VERY disappointed with this trailer actually. They gave away the entire story! You just have to watch the movie to find out who the father is (though I bet they&#39;re gonna do a Mamma Mia like ending. &quot;Who cares who the father is!&quot;), apart from that you could just watch the trailer.
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitai love these trailers that give away the whole movie. now i dont needa buy tickets and waste time
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLittle Mix!!!
mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitaLittle Mix...<br>competition song

mJsvmscPY9wdelimeterByIshitacant wait!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaBROOOOOO!!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve got a good feeling about this one!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaMan this looks good
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitameh, i&#39;ll wait for the vhs, this is something you see everyday on the deep web.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThey were right to fear me. If only they had listened to their cowardice. Had they not taken my home with fire, I would not have taken their children.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaseems awsome!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshita&quot;The VVitch&quot; XD
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaGee, I wonder if there&#39;s a logical explanation for the supposed supernatural; the teenage girl is a psychopath.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaBeautifully eerie, can&#39;t wait to see this movie!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaYes, looks good!!! I hope it&#39;s not a disappointment like most horror films. :/
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI will admit, this does look quite intriguing and eerie.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaMy kind of movie
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaHey look at that. A horror movie that actually looks creepy.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaDamn bruh!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhaaaat the fuck? <br>That looks so eerie and nightmarish.<br>.... Yup, I&#39;m seeing it.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaA24 &gt; life
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaSo...it&#39;s the, &quot;what The Village should&#39;ve been&quot; movie.<br><br>Nice!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathe village..
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathe Vuh vitch...
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathe Vuh vitch...
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshita...So where was the witch?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaonly asian horrors scare me but can anyone make some good recommendations ? something really scary
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitanice to see people doing new things in horror
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathis looks raw as fuck, i cant wait to see this
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a stunning looking film.Not surprised it won the best director award at Sundance.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a wonderful horror anthology by Chantal Noordeloos called deeply twisted, with a story in it that really reminds me of this trailer. I highly recommend it
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitapufff... hansel y gretel da mas miedo
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitapufff... hansel y gretel da mas miedo
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathose horror voices, reminded me instantly of The Shining/2001
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaA trailer for a horror movie without jumpscares? And the movie looks genuinely original and frightening? Has my time machine finally worked?<br><br>No wait, everything still sucks. Movie looks good at least.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaVan Helsing is more horror than this
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll wait for it to appear on Netflix or in Redbox.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaBy the time this comes to some medium in which I can get my hands on it I&#39;ll forget about it. Anyone know of any way this won&#39;t fall off my radar?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaOld Finchy should just tie some shoes together and launch &#39;em into the woods . That should sort it .
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaYay the Blair Witch origin story
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaAt last! A horror flick without shitty and cheap jump scares.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitatrailer isn&#39;t even scary! all i see is the boob lady meh..
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaIf this is the trailer then we&#39;re in trouble. I like when they show sporadic things that don&#39;t make any sense and somehow in your mind it supposed to convey quality &amp; anticipation when all it is horse poop! The people who make the trailers are supposed to piece it together so it looks better than what it is and that&#39;s why I said, &quot;we&#39;re in trouble&quot; because I am watching the trailer and thinking, &quot;I don&#39;t really give a shit about seeing this movie&quot;.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s 2015. Isn&#39;t anti-witch propaganda 300+ years too late?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaIs this the same witch from 1999? Damn, this bitch is crafty.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathis looks like some m. night shamamlaayanaman crap
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitabaa baa dook
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitafuuuuuck
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaFucking great! Loving the mini Horror-Renaissance that&#39;s bringing forward these gems. True genre defining films aren&#39;t about the cheap scares, the script and drawn out tension, is in my eyes what makes a Horror film truly great.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaa24  can do no wrong!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI ain&#39;t seeing this shit. It looks scary and disturbing and I typically love these kinds of movies but this trailer totally irked me the wrong way. 
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI want to be genuinely unnerved. I really, really do.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThe Blair Witch Project 3: The Salem Years
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThose peasants are far too clean... at least the movie is R rated, that is a good signal... no loud little shits!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not impressed.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaReally this was what the hype was all about? The only spook I got was from the narrator&#39;s voice. Bummed....
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaOkay am I the only one who didn&#39;t find this trailer to be even a little unnerving? Whats so interesting/scary about this movie? An unknown entity from the forest messing with people? LAME!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitait doesn&#39;t look that scary.  ::runs away::
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhen the baby vanished I laughed and said, &quot;N O P E&quot;.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaShe turned me into a newt!!!<br><br>(I got better)
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the Moondoor?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaA24 films are SO awesome. They&#39;re so current and interesting!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty amazing...
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it look like the VVitch at the end
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLol did the fucking Goat just grow at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQXmlf3Sefg&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a>?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaShit this looks good,  finally a good horror movie. please dont suck,
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWOW!!!!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaCreepy colonial times
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaDooooooooopppppppeeeeeee! A24 always picks the goodies!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThank god some good HORROR MOVIE.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaFinchy!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaговно
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaJackFrags
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaNow, <i>this</i> is how you do a horror film!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaNow THIS is how you make a trailer, I have no idea what is going on but I want to find out.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaAs a pagan, I&#39;m really fucking sick and tired at christians tying old traditions and practices to &quot;kidnapping babies and worshipping satan&quot; shit. Fuck off hollywood.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI have been excited for this since the vague reviews came out after Sundance, and even the trailer was worth the wait. It won&#39;t be like the village, the director has worked to make the whole thing historically accurate to the 17th century, down to the speech patterns and minimal lighting in some scenes. This is going to be frickin&#39; amazing.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLooks kinda neat, will see.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitathe gothic environment it creates is awesome.......
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaIs that the breast feeding mom from game of thrones lol
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaholy fuck this looks crazy.  must see Travis MacMillan
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaOn my radar.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLooks great. Definitely going to have to watch this.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaTHE bitch--vitch
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitawhere is Geralt when you need him?!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThey look like illegal immigrants, high on meth, squatting in the park.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaFinnaly something great not those found footage movies.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThat entire two minute trailer was better than the whole two hours of It Follows. And we gotta wait until next year for this? FUCK!!!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaIt Follows and then this - could it be Renaissance of horror cinema?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWait , that voice in intro belongs to the Riddick (Vin Diesel)?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQXmlf3Sefg&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a> Goat rape ?
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaFINCHYYYYY
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaGoat Simulator: The Beginning
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThe Village 2.0, directed by someone talented.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLysa Arryn and Dagmar Cleftjaw play the parents. This won&#39;t turn out well for the kids.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting for this film since January when I read some amazing reviews from Sundance, I&#39;m so happy so see films like this, like the Babadook, It Follows and Goodnight Mommy, genre films with atmosphere, great stories and fascinating characters, something that big Hollywood forgot to put on their genre films (I&#39;m looking at you Blumhouse). I&#39;m gonna watch the shit out of this movie.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaExcellent trailer.<br>I think this will be finally a horror movie that shocks, but not cheaply (like most of the horror movies that the industry has to offer in recent years).
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie!! It looks very promising!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaWhat a beautiful trailer.
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLysa Arryn: The Early Days
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaTrailer for the horrorfilm The Witch looks amazing! Looking forward to this for sure!
iQXmlf3SefgdelimeterByIshitaLooks great. I always trust A24

7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaFoda demais, parece que finalmente vamos ter o Capitão America de respeito, o líder dos Vingadores. XD

7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaLooks incredible.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitashit incredible!!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaYes, yes,yes...can&#39;t get here any sooner...
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaDear Marvel, take all of my monies, please.  Thanks.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitayay early birthday present

7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaOh my body is so ready.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie isn&#39;t as amazing as this trailer I&#39;m never watching a trailer ever again!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaThis and Godzilla. That&#39;s 2014. I am so freakin&#39; ready!!!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaLoud noises!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitanerdgasom
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaDamn this is epic!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t. freaking. wait.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitathis is going to shit on iron man 3 and thor dark world i cannot wait for this!!!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaif I die before I get to watch this movie, I PROMISE i will KILL MYSELF!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaYeeessss
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaAlso, I bet Nick Fury is the dead guy.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaOh god. im sobbing already
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitabest marvel yet!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks more like a Transformers movie trailer than anything else.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaYES YES YES
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert: The Winter Soldier is Bucky
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaOH my!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaMan of Steel is pure garbage compared to this trailer alone<br><br>HELL YEAH BUCKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaGrounded in what passes for realism in the Marvel universe, these Cap movies are great and different from the high stakes universe ending themes in Thor and the Avengers. Evans does a good job with the role.
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaFalcon looks cooler and cooler with each trailer
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitayeahhhh 
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaNick Fury&#39;s injuires put someone else in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D, that guy is working with the Winter Soldier and wants Captain America out of the way. S.H.I.E.L.D civil war ensues, will lead into Avengers: AoU.

7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not really excited for this compared to the other Marvel movies, but I&#39;m more excited to see this then I was for the second Thor movie. I think I watch most Marvel movies because I just want to connect the dots leading up to Thanos 
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaDAMN !!!!!! the other Super bowl trailers better bring the heat !!!!!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaOh yeah!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitaHell Yeah!!
7SlILk2WMTIdelimeterByIshitasigh, all trailers seem to give away the entire plot now.

Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis crap is a damn cinematic masterpiece
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaNice
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitafirst it sounds like a horror film then towards the middle its a family funny film. i loved the whole movie!
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaFiwwiw<br><br>Hsjwwj
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaI guess every comment here is written by a bot; This movie was absolute trash wtf
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaFun movie for the family. An original concept out of Hollywood? Wow.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaI like the concept that a creature can live in a truck

Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis was my favorite movie of all time
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaSing and Rogue 1 AMC theater
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s movies that are conceived to bomb the hardest on box-office. <br><br>Who can validate such dumb ideas...it&#39;s beyond me...how can Hollywood be that out of touch with reality, it&#39;s so funny. <br><br>Half of their movies bomb and all the one that failed have a failure so easy to anticipate...damn, I&#39;ll be a shareholder I&#39;ll plead for &quot;beheading&quot; CEO&#39;s.

Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaplis upload
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitawhen i read the title i pictured old school monster trucks from the 80s crushing cars and shit not this fuckin weird ass scifi situation.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaSomewhere out there, up in the top levels of Paramount Picture&#39;s executive branch, there is a guy with a major monster truck and testicle hentai fetish.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitathere is so much negativity here. I thought this was a movie for young kids? Didn&#39;t think adults had to like it...it&#39;s for kids.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaOh boy they are going to need to pitch lot of money I they want an oscar.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThe creech is like a octopus
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaWatch Online Monster Trucks now<br>You can go to this site <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/57CQHyeTa7m?sfc=true">https://plus.google.com/u/0/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/57CQHyeTa7m?sfc=true</a>
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitai wanna see this movie so bad
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaextremely lame. only some inner city pansy that knows nothing about 4x4 trucks would dream up this insanity. I&#39;m so glad I watched the preview instead of just wasting my time and money on this idiotic crap. every thumb down. tank.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis is awesome! Can&#39;t wait to see it :)
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis is what happens if you put a Monster in a truck!
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaOMG SO CUTE
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaHow much cocaine was done to think this could ever be a good plan?
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaSam fucking Winchester?
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaOh boy....I really wanna kms
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m loving this, it&#39;s so simple, so silly and it looks like SO MUCH FREAKING FUN!<br>I really hope Nickelodeon decides to make an animated series from this, cuz&#39; I&#39;d totally buy those Monster Trucks!
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaI think this might flop because of all the big movies coming out in 2017, this will get extremely forgotten
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshita<i>Looks cute.</i>
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is shown before &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot;. Now in theaters and in Digital 3D and IMAX 3D.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s about a squid that hides inside a car? Ooooookkkkaaayyy.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaMarket your calendars. January 13, 2017 is when one of the biggest Hollywood box office bombs is going to go off.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThat monster can swim in water his like octopus
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaAlso thank fuck Split&#39;s out the week after this
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis can&#39;t be worse than the Max Steel movie right? Nah it&#39;s not gonna be that bad
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitawow this looks bad.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitathis shyt looks wack as fuck!
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaI can only imagine  the amount of drugs being done when this was pitched..
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitafunny
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshita&quot;Oh no, we didn&#39;t mean the title literally,&quot; cried a producer into his pillow one night.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitawhoa, this looks like a fun movie. Can&#39;t wait!
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaYeah Nickelodeon movies😃
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaIt looks meh. Sad too because the last trailer was a bit better.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaStick a hot guy in it and anyone will watch it
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaStreet Sharks are next.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis movie is clearly an allegory about white privilege.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis is clearly Oscar bait
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitalooks cute
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaGM
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaFuck You It&#39;s January strikes
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitawondering how can you NOT relase these fucking trailers in 2k or higher
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaHavok must of survived the explosion, faked his death, and pretended to be a normal person.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaAcording to a report a few weeks ago, Paramount Pictuires its gonna loose 115 M with this movie.<br><br>Now I se why, poor Lucas Till and Jane Levy, I like those guys.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThe music in the beginning is &quot;Peculiar Magic&quot; by Audiomachine.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaRemember when you guys came out and said this was going to lose you millions of dollars? And it hadn&#39;t even come out yet? Yeah. I liked that one.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThe January release date says it all.
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitarotten tomato score *90% fresh
Fd0GdvApn-odelimeterByIshitaThis movie is meant for like really young kids. Like 5 year olds
