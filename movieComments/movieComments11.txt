_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaI just saw this movie, and i now have a 10 month girl, and i was like the Magical pregnancy unicorn girl, but now its a different story but this movie made me miss my pregnancy so much,  i really did enjoyed my pregnancy i ate so much and never gained any pound, my hair was so thick and long, my body looked so good, never got swollen feet, no stretch marks but ended up having emergency c section after i stop at 5 cm, but also it took me 5 years to get pregnant, i had also a bleeding at 2 months pregnant nothing serious but i got scared because i thought the worst, so i did relate to all characters but honestly i would love to do this again
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaNot bad my only personal pet peeve which is not a overall bad movie thing but just something that bugs me is these were all different stories so it was jumping from couple to couple. I was hoping it made them all know eachother in some form. But these couples all are different story lines so it jumps from one couples story to another and it gets annoying keeping up with multiple different stories in it vs keeping up with everyone in one….  same story.

_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaI will only watch this for Chace Crawford(:
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaRaising a child is not gender specific. Neither is hunting or killing. As a matter of fact, the only thing truly gender specific are the roles we play in the act of reproduction, like who sticks what where and who carries the child to term.
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pregnant, and i&#39;m DYING just watching this preview xD legit tears from my eyes.

_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaI normally hate films with multiple celebrities like New Years Eve - except Love Actually - but this look really good and funny. Amazing cast.
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaI hope Rob makes enough money to start Human Giant again. 
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaCAMERON DIAZ , JENNIFER LOPEZ ,ELIZABETH BANKS ,  DENNIS QUAID ,  CHRIS ROCK .  
WHAT ELSE  CAN YOU  ASK  FOR ..  THIS MOVIE  IS GONNA BE WORTHWATCHING . 
_8Um0DEEjkMdelimeterByIshitaLooks funny :) 
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaremember when Kirsten was cute?
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshita10/10 film………..if you haven’t seen it and are debating……..watch it!   It’s a mystery thriller……I guess if your not a huge movie buff, best way to compare it to would the style and intensity of Silence of the Lambs………..kinda hokey to compare it it like that but it has that feel…..and the acting is superb….plus…..there’s a strange twist and it based on a true story……👍🏻👍🏻
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaThis is a good True-crime movie. Also Kirsten Dunst is a juggernaut. She just shows up and kills it every. single. movie.
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know about the music of this movie?
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca6hW4J7Jeo&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a> is that amy and meg march reunited?????
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why they chose to cast Gosling as Durst. He doesn&#39;t look anything like him, sound anything like him, or act anything like him. It&#39;s like Gosling did no research for the role.
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshita2022 lets go! this flick was a beast!
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaIf I ever am on trial for murder, I want the bufoons from Galveston to be my jurors, or Orenthal&#39;s jurors. 🙄🙄
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitaThis is such an good movie. Ryan Gosling isn&#39;t bad to look and neither is Kristen Dunst😜<br><br>Also, I think his dad, may have, had her killed but Robert definitely killed the other two!!
Ca6hW4J7JeodelimeterByIshitawoow, not scаaаm!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaPlease people, say me name of this song
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhy wont they make a Bloodsport 2 with Van Damme? WHY? They made 2 kickboxer sequels and they’re good. But why can’t they make a Bloodsport with Van Damme? Bring Chong Li back looking for vengeance, that’s already a movie I’d pay to see
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitavery good fight scenes
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song in the trailer?
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was awesome. If the fights were at least good then it would be tolerable
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t even make $300k 😂
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaNuk su khao!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWait Van Damme is back? Didn&#39;t his character get killed off by Tong Po in part 2? Capped in the forehead?
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaName song trailer??
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaCómo se llama la canción del tráiler
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just here checking all the movies of THE ONE who is taking down a real life EMPIRE.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaCouldn&#39;t even finish this movie, turned it off about halfway through. What a soulless reboot! Just watch the original instead, it&#39;s so much better.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll put Van Damme first, nice to see him back to Kickboxer franchise!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaBuena idea, pero carece de MITICA!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaVery good film
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThis flick is pure crap,<br>Every contact moment looks so powerless and absolutely fake.<br><br>J.C. van Damme ❤
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWE NEED BOYKA!<br> BOYKA<br> BOYKA <br>BOYKA
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaJust terrible ...i actually laughed at the last big fight at the end
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaLol what a joke, batistusta as tong po, just NO
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshita20 years to late for a remake or sequel of the original kickboxer! Should&#39;ve made one by 2010!!!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaHow Did I miss this remake.... underground film release....
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThe song???
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitawhere is the sondtrack ????  nothing like 80°s songs
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaVan Damme actually got killed with he&#39;s brother at the end of kickboxer 1. So it doesn&#39;t make sense.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThey couldn&#39;t get Sasha Mitchell so they Hired his stand in
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone else prefer the original actor that played Tong Po over Bautista?
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhats the name of the song???
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaIt Should&#39;ve respectfully been Scott Adkins
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaBOYKA !!!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThis was a Great Martial Arts Film.......it took me a long while to realize it was not a sequel but a remake/reboot of the original film!! 🤔❤️💯
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhy is tong po played by Bautista I&#39;m tired of seeing daves big bald head he is in almost every movie I watch nowadays gaurdians of the Galaxy,hotel artimis,avengers,stuber,escape plan,iron fist,enter the warriors gate where is the original tong po Michel qissi
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaYES IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR AGES
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaAlain mousi should have been The Immortal Iron Fist
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaLol van dam  original kickboxer trains 2016 kickboxer
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaSong??
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song name
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaEven though it sad David Bautista take out his brother like that but the way how Batista stand like that you know the martial arts type stand  like he has the balance he was throwing him basically like a rag doll wasn&#39;t any match I don&#39;t know if anybody realizes that probably  I don&#39;t know
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathis movie is a joke stop re making classics
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaDave BATISTA IS THE FIRST BEAST IN WWE
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathis movie so suck the first real kickboxer with van dam as kurt sloan as the best bautista what a joke mdr
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaCharlie Nash takes the torch to fight Batista while Guile mentors him.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaTwister vs Batista
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitareminded me of the movie &quot;Bloodspot&quot;
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathe orginal looks better
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaDamn this movie must of been made a couple years ago. Darren Shahlavi is already dead.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathe animal has been unleashed and van damme is back after all these years.I even forgot this guy even existed.what happened to him anyway?
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaLittle do people know, this is actually a love story.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaAfter watching the first I already know the outcome but will still give it a watch
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitahay đấy
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Eric Roberts and Sasha Mitchel?
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitalooks low budget and garbage
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaNice...Van dam is the man !!!!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaLook like the student (Van Damme) became the Teacher.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaI only watch it because of Batista, GSP and Velasquez.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitablood sport 2
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaVery good!!!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaBatista just isn&#39;t scary at all hahaha
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathey told the whole plot of the movie. in a trailer. there is nothing left except good fight scenes.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a remake of one of Van Damme movie, the plot is very familiar, but either way will still love to see it just to see Van Damme in action again.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitagood looking. but bad coreography
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaif you&#39;re afraid to die in a fight, you&#39;re dead. = even shakespeare would blush at the quality of that writing....
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s kinda funny film about kickboxing in thailand and there are no thailand actor/actrees (tonny jah or someone else) in this trailer<br><br>Such a shame
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaHow the fuck there no asians in this shit
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s the same bloody movie as the first 1 fight down to the glass on the wraps fight
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaBautista and Tong Po seem to visit the same hair stylist nowadays
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch this shit.
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitawhat the f*ck with Bautista&#39;s stupid hair !!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaAhhhh Kickboxer was an fucking awesome movie,this looks interesting,nice to see Van Damme back
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch it just for Van Damme!
0BeJu-0MsikdelimeterByIshitathis looks so sick :)
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaSiri... How do you perform CPR on a D-AHH<br><br>Going to enjoy this one...
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThis was a fun movie to work on. Jason and Cameron were very nice to all of the folks who worked on the graduation scene. That&#39;s  where you see &quot;Jason&quot; diving from the balcony in order to stop the video from being shown.. (no spoiler there). Most of the film was shot in Massachusetts last August. I know that the wide shots do show California. But they&#39;re primarily only wide shots..
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaCameron Diaz&#39;s only appeal is sex 
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaI lost it at the CPR part XD
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaYes, Cameron Diaz was attractive... 20 years ago. Now she&#39;s 40-something and only doing movies that serve the singular purpose of propping up the illusion she&#39;s still hot s**t. I&#39;m not sure if this is to feed her own ego or what, but Cameron, face facts: In another 10 years, the only movie role you&#39;re going to be considered for is Skeletor, in a remake of He-Man, and you&#39;ll be beaten by Courtney Cox.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaSony does marketing for Apple

sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThere IS a sense of irony here, right? I mean, Diaz was a porn star before she became an actress, and fought REALLY hard to remove all videos of her off the internet.<br><br>This isn&#39;t a Hollywood &quot;based on a true story&quot; bullcrap, is it?

sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaanyone know the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxl4aOyHSwo&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a> ?!?!
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaSOOOOOOOOOOO many movies these two played a couple. It&#39;s got to get unconfortable.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThe Shoes - Time to Dance, is one of the songs for people asking about what songs are in the trailer, great song.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitamarshaaaalalalala
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaFunny how they were both in Bad Teacher xD
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaComing out in my b-day...;)
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaCameron Diaz is not attractive enough, or young enough, to play this role. They should have used somebody else. I could barely stand her in Bad Teacher.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThe fucking dog at the end scared the shit out of me but after that this movie looks dumb as hell smh.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitasiri,how do you do CPR on a dog
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshita&quot; it went up. it went up to cloud!&quot; &quot;can&#39;t you get it down from the cloud?&quot;<br>&quot;Nobody understands the cloud&quot; Lmao xD
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThe trailer has failed to amuse. I especially hate it when the soundboard screams at <a href="http://youtu.be/sxl4aOyHSwo?t=1m53s">1:53</a>. I wouldn&#39;t mind so much except I know I heard it before. Telltale Games... Sue something. ;)
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaOk now this movie looks funny not one of those repetitive movies we see now and I know that feeling when u do something and your like uh oh i hope that this stupid device or comp doesn&#39;t share it to everyone xD
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t it films like this that helped to throw elliot rodger off his rocker? lol nah isn&#39;t fair to blame hollywood cause he was a murderous psychopath but god damn anyone else think these kinda films are so old? lol at least something about mary was unique at the time 
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThe Cloud 
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaIf you want to go see this movie, it means that you are an idiot.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA wanna see it
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a horrible, unfunny combination of &quot;Zack and Mary make a porno&quot; and &quot;This is 40&quot;, and the latter was an awful movie itself...
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaLol what terrible casting. Like anyone could ever lose interest in sleeping with Cameron Diaz. That kind of problem is only experienced by people who settled or let themselves go.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitagay illuminati shlock for gay illuminati people
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshita&quot;Nobody understands the cloud&quot; pff

sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaWow how is Cameron Diaz still hot? Isn&#39;t she like, 50?
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitafunny enough cameron diaz did make sex types before she was a big star.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaCompletely avoidable situation, why would your tablet even cloud sync a video and the  SHARE IT publicly, that&#39;s your own damn fault.<br><br>Long and short, twits.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaLooks like crap.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaWhile watching this I was really hoping it was gonna be called sex cloud!  XD

sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitasubtle sony. real subtle
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaPeople are such sheep for liking this lack luster crap. I&#39;m sorry I TRIED to enjoy this and it does not appeal to me.
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaCameron&#39;s body is still nice, but her face is fucked up because of whatever plastic surgery she has had.  
sxl4aOyHSwodelimeterByIshitaCamoeron D is so fanny.. eh I mean funny.

k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaHardy’s best
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitathe way he wrapped the &#39;hand&#39; calmly, right there I instantly know there is something about him... very good movie though, Tom Hardy is the best!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaNobody ever sees you coming. Do they.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitathis is such a great movie, I can&#39;t believe I just saw it for the 1st time...I watched it 10x since last week
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaI just have to know before I watch this movie, does the dog die?
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaSCHOENAERTS
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaAnd Matthias Schoenaerts!!!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaJames Gandolfini&#39;s last film, What an Actor, Rest In Peace With Our LORD!!!!!!! JESUS!!!!!!! CHRIST!!!!!!! IN HEAVEN!!!!!!!<br><br>GOD BLESS!!!!!!!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the song that is played in this trailer? toward the end thanks in advance!!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaMatthias Schoenhaerts is the greatest actor alive.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaI just wanted Marv to turn into Tony and kick there fucking asses!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaI got to see it
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaThey never see you coming, do they Bob?
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaMarv never had the makings of a varsity athlete
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaThis is might be the most underrated film EVER. There isn&#39;t one person I know that I don&#39;t try get to watch this movie, and every one that does comes out of it with, &quot;WOW&quot;.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitabest movie 2014 so sad many havent seen this
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshita5 years later,still my favorite !
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaonly reason im watching this is cuz james gandolifini is in it honeslty dont even care if its bad i love that man so much so sad he passed away rip james :((
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaA must see. Minus all the CGI and an excellent believable story. Well acted. Hollywood needs a lot more of these movies and a lot less of the excess garbage.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaIf any aspiring writers or screen play writers want to look at how you develop a character - this is the movie for it.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaI Thoroughly Enjoyed This From Start To Finish!😄
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaNothing for little kids and people who like action.<br>Hard movie killed me at the end and had to think the whole day about it.<br>Reminds me of sopranos finale where you only here The door getting opened and then it ends.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaThe trailer is better than the movie !!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Nooma Rapace - and written by Dennis Lehane? Hell yeah!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy might be the most convincing actor on the planet
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitalooks good
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaLooks good.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaI cant wait.
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaThis looks great &amp; that puppy is uber cute!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaCheck out the amazing movie &quot;bullhead&quot; from the same Belgian director!
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome. What song plays at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8upwtn9A30&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> ?
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie.  I will be looking for this one and I might even go to a theater again.  
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy is amazing in every roll he plays, cannot wait to see this. 
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitaSong?
k8upwtn9A30delimeterByIshitathis is james Gandolfini)&#39;s last film,and with tom hardy..ill defo be watchin this one
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s song on 0.56?,please tell me :)
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaProbably the most intense Disney movie yet
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaMusic: Zella Day - Compass
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaBased on a true story...... well what isn&#39;t nowadays. Fucking avatar was based on a true story.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get me wrong this seems like a nice movie, but why Is it a Disney movie? Kids shouldn&#39;t watch this.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe cast looks soo good.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaNot the traditional Disney movie, but it looks good.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaSomehow some disney movies dont seem<br>Like tey are disney lol
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitagreat, another film that solidifies my desire to <b>never go on a cruise</b>
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a movie for little kids its for old people 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a movie for little kids its for old people 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant! Can&#39;t wait to see it! 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIs this a perfect storm remake or a completely different story?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe Finest Hours is a great well directed and acted movie, I recommend it for everyone!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI GOT EXCITED WHEN I HEARD ZELLA
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaNo WAY! I NEVER thought a movie would be made out of that book. I read the book long ago. What a harrowing tale. Those were some good shots of 36500. I look forward to this greatly.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaDisney is stepping their game up with their movies. They are lacking when it comes to their TV shows though...
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail for this video reminds me of the new Hitman game coming out. 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitamanipulative bullshit.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this. And it just so happens i&#39;m leaving for the Coast Guard boot camp at the end of this September. I just heard about this movie today. Glad to see the finest rescue service in the world getting some recognition
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t dislike this generic bs hard enough...do people seriously still fall for this?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThat reminds me of Titanic and it seems boring as f**k!!!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis is a Disney movie?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks aweful
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaOoooh I&#39;m getting some Titanic feels...
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just going to point out that true stories don&#39;t count as original ideas, so disney still doesn&#39;t have any movies coming out that are original movie ideas. This looks great though.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaYES ZELLA
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitagood trailer ruined by a stupid song.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaEric Bana? Military theme? Sold!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis caught my eye from advertising  on a YouTube video. I wanna see this for sure. 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe song from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmllwTKtqU&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a> is Zella Day - Compass
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaPretty full on for Disney, trying to scare kids from the ocean? Whats that about?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaUSCG to the rescue !
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis should be called &quot; Selfless &quot; . Not the other one.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like crap
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaSemper Paratus.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaZella♡
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaP.s Is Touchstone Pictures dead when making movies?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI think in my opinion that Disney is now Mature more of a Entertainment brand and not solely on Family market. I think Disney is more like Touchstone Pictures of 2016 because it is a Disaster / Action/ Thriller/ true Story Film.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitasounds good .. a different and interesting history !
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIn a word....AWESOME trailer! I&#39;m very glad Disney got the rights to the story and film, and very proud of the men and women of the Coast Guard, past and present! Parts of the film were filmed on location in MA, Chatham, Cohasset, Brant Rock, and in the one of the main warehouses at the old General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy MA. That&#39;s were the close-up water scenes were filmed in a giant wave pool they built in ground. Would love to see the premiere of the movie here in MA. Thank you Disney!!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaPixar would probz do it better.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI pissed out the far right window at 55 seconds when I was black out at a school dance. Good to see its making a comeback.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitawhat is the music that starts at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmllwTKtqU&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIs there a single POC in this film?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIt seems like just yesterday that Disney strove to make sure no one died in their movies.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie trailer giving away to much
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaMeh....boring. I will just wait for the Blue Ray to come out
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks quite good...
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIf this is TRUE story - I take my hat off to naval engineers. To design a tanker that would stay afloat when cut in half, and in such weather? It&#39;s a mechanical feat worthy of Da Vinci.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis song &quot;Compass&quot; is beautiful, great choice for this trailer
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaCD/DVD
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitacan someone tell me what&#39;s the name of the song in trailer ?<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmllwTKtqU&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a>
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.  I be looking for it
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaSo happy to hear Zella Day used in this! She&#39;s really talented and the world needs to hear her! :)
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s quite a cast, but the story looks a little allover the place. Hope it winds up being good.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaTHE HULK IS IN THIS MOVIE
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitawhats the name of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmllwTKtqU&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a>?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll never get it...they always put Boston actors in these Boston movies and they are the only ones that sound normal...Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger sound just as bad as that wife on Ray Donovan and Tom Hanks in Catch me if you can...just don&#39;t over act. keep it simple
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI know a video is good when i get goosebumps watching it,
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaLook! It&#39;s Hal Jordan!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis story is similar to the sinking of the S.S Carl D. Bradley. The Bradley was built in Ohio in 1927, and served until November 18th 1958 when she broke in two on Lake Michigan. Of the 35 men on board. Only two survived when they were saved by the Coast Guard vessel Sundew.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks awesome!! By the way two T-2 tankers are still in use today. The Lee A. Tregurtha, and the American Victory. However they were rebuilt in the early 60&#39;s for the Great Lakes iron ore trade. The only way you can tell that they were T-2 tankers is the stern, and the shape of the bow. 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaChris Pine. Dat accent tho. I&#39;ll see it.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitawheres mark wahlberg and his goat beard?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitalooks wicked pissah
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe accent is horrible.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe effects look like garbage.  Hopefully they get cleaned up before they actually release this thing
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI live in Chatham MA! Das my hometown!!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaWell, this looks embarrassingly shitty.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe song is &quot;Compass&quot; by Zella Day.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI really only watched because of Zella tbh
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaaaayyyyyeeeee Zella Day &lt;3
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaHa I live in Chatham.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit that cast is insane 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI life in marshfield ma were some of it was filmed!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t that one of the stepsister in Cinderella? 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaAs someone who spends some time in Chatham this is a must see. I believe it&#39;s the rescue of the crew from the Pendleton.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaCasey Affleck outworked everybody in this movie, you&#39;ll see and feel as if he&#39;s the main actor!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaRead the book. Absolutely incredible, and I don&#39;t think that this will disappoint.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaMar em Fúria versão Disney.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThe Perfect Storm Part 2, i&#39;ll give it a watch..
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaIt;s tragic that movie with a cast and premise like this is so let down by the terrible special effects. Effects aren&#39;t everything ,but the perfect storm holds up far better than this because they knew how to limit the use of entirely digital scenes. Visually, this looks atrocious- hell even the non- digital stuff looks like the goddamn hobbit- clean and weird looking.  If this is unintentional, it;s a total failure of craftsmanship, if this is the idea, that it looks like a fucking cartoon, then it;s failure of common sense.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitano disrespect but the finest hour still belongs to NASA
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI see Graham! :)
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!!  Anyone know what music is used starting at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQmllwTKtqU&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaMy God! is the remarkable true story,  &quot;AWESOME&quot; trailer.<br>Mr. Chris Pine WOOW!!!  I&#39;m counting the days to see in theaters.<br>Thanks Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman to write incredible and wonderful book, and thanks Disney for bring us thid incredible story.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaHolliday Grainger! Chris Pine! Eric Bana!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great. Big Holliday Grainger fan. Wouldn&#39;t mind knowing what the final music is though?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaZella Day&#39;s &quot;Compass&quot; has me feeling those good feelings. Should be a great film!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaI made it 100
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaWhat is this music?
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool.
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitamaybe
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so incredibly amazing! I&#39;m super excited to see this! 
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaThat looks promising...
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshitaCaptain Kirk do you read me?   This is Spock, were going to be in Star Trek 3 next year!!
BQmllwTKtqUdelimeterByIshita1st
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@ilovebrianwilson38 
Sorry but there is no interesting story coming out of that city&#39;s baseball team. Or maybe make a story on how it took them nearly 60 years to win a World Series again. 

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@gkendall16 
Odd but true. He said its just another game when interviewed after that 20th win.

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaI hope the movie is as great as the book! Can&#39;t wait
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@RedButterfly430 i always said that when I saw him with Redford in the film SPY GAMES :) I love Brad and Robert

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like I just watched the whole movie.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaQuestion: What do the Oakland A&#39;s and LA/Anaheim Angels have in common? 
Answer: Both have beaten the San Francisco Giants in a World Series and are featured in big screen movies! 

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaGentlemen, BEHOLD!
Bobby Kotick in his first movie appearance! And what do you know, &quot;Money&quot; is in the title.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@ZeeL4J8C2 dumbass. It&#39;s not about the A&#39;s exactly. It&#39;s about Billy Beane and his assistant starting the sabermetrics method and winning a lot being championship contenders with a bunch of nobodys and now everybody is doing it in baseball. The year the red sox did it the won they&#39;re first championship in nearly a century, more than half the league does it now. And yeah the A&#39;s lose in the end, but it&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t seen a sports movie where the team doesn&#39;t win in the end. So stop hatin!
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@Superfly75100 how is winning 103 games lucky you fucking moron
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaBut the Athletics never won though, so what is going to be the climax, getting the crap beat out of the by Yankees?
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaBest successes from the Moneyball draft: Nick Swisher, Jeremy Guthrie, Joe Blanton, Mark Teahen. What&#39;s the big deal about sabermetrics again?
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita&quot;I need more money&quot;

You&#39;re asking it to the right person: Bobby Kottick
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita&lt;3333
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@Crass2k5 alot skinnier with more hair lol.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@bigvalbowski100 Yeah, you can tell cause he calls him &quot;wash.&quot; Should&#39;ve found someone a lot skinnier though.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitasame crap sports story movies.. can they do it, can the manager pull it off...in the end its the last ball can he hit it out the stadium...of course he can
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@Genre346 San Marcos Texas son!
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@stickinthemud1524 a Jennnifer Aniston fan? don&#39;t be such a stick in the mud!

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitathis is how the marlins won 2 world series!!!!!! ya i just said that
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitai like how jonah hill and chris pratt are comedic actors and all of a sudden have big roles in a likely oscar contender.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitanever thought brad pitt and jonah hill will ever be in a movie together AWESOME!!!!!

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaGiant fans... U mad?
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@JaredBohan31 

Did the Giants have 8 straight winning seasons on a shoestring budget? (Not to mention completely revolutionize how front offices evaluate players???)  I didn&#39;t think so. Way to finally win a title after 60-something years losers... lol
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@dre32pitt check explosions out in concert and thank me later. they&#39;re incredible
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaanyone else think this was about the game?

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@thepoethomeless Ha.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaNot really my type of film but I will watch it because Brad Pitt is in it :)
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaAs a longtime A&#39;s fan I&#39;m excited to see this. will bring back a lot of memories and laughs at how awful those players were individually but as a team they were great.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@bass109 Hail Satan.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaThe song at :46 - The Black Keys &quot;Howlin&#39; for You.&quot;  Pretty awesome album, BTW.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita1:21   The mighty Rio Grande - This will destroy You,   a really amazing post rock band.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaWow, he looks like Robert Redford, agreed on Oscar material! 
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@HJP3131 Armenian (Zaililian, he&#39;s won oscars too) and Jew screenwriters LOL nice combo.

-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaMy girlfriend and I are an extra in this movie. Bucket list, check. Pretty awesome how our team get&#39;s it&#39;s own movie! Hope Pitt get&#39;s the Oscar!
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that song starting at :46
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaMoneyball = zero titles.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m an extra in this!!!
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitacongrats brad pitt, you just won yourself a motherfucking oscar
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@Sage80 Sounds like Sigur Ros, but I can&#39;t be sure.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaanyone know what year this movie was based on? guessing 2002 season
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@MikeSuth69 and you&#39;ll lose them all.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaYES YES YES!!  The black keys........... :D :D
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@kaleadams7

&quot;The Mighty Rio Grande&quot; by This Will Destroy You
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@radicalezra name one please
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitalol, was that Bobby Kotick at 0:17?

So they&#39;ll release 75% of the movie on opening day, then sell the rest of the movie in 15-minute chunks and charge 5 bucks apiece for them. 
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaWhy would I want to see this movie again? There are a billion better baseball stories out there.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@dkg17 
There is no &quot;luck&quot; in winning a championship. You need big named players in order to do so.
Was this &quot;analysis&quot; around when the Yankees won all of their championships? NO. It&#39;s just a way to look smart when you have no money to spend on players. Under this system, the A&#39;s WILL NEVER WIN IT ALL.
Last time I checked, you need to score runs to win - all of the other stats are bull shit.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@MikeSuth69 
Okay - how much? I&#39;ll take that  bet
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaIts funny how it is portrayed as if it is a team that beat the odds when sabermetrics is playing the odds
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaman, i wish the guy who plays Wash gets a line that says &quot;thats the way baseball go&quot;
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@TheShannon76 the A&#39;s had a twenty game winning streak in 2002
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaSomehow the idea of Bobby Kotick owning the A&#39;s is completely plausible.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@MikeSuth69 i really hope it does..
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@Wootnezz Dont know dont care but my team has won 3 championships in a row MULTIPLE TIMES
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaI was skeptical of this movie when I heard about it but damn it looks great.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@2taggs2 the fact that every single team in baseball uses the same type of analysis now speaks volumes more than his inability to get lucky over a dozen or so games once a year
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaBeane gets SOOO much credit - but how many Championships have the A&#39;s won while he was GM??
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@jayma75  Current contenders use Analytics now... A&#39;s no longer have an edge, since everybody followd Beane on sabermetrics.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaP.S.H. as Art Howe? I&#39;m sold
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaEverything looks good except i&#39;m not thrilled with the fact that they had to change Paul DePodesta&#39;s name. otherwise, it could contend for an oscar in something.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaThey charged their players for sodas, how pathetic is that. lol

Moneyball didn&#39;t win a world series, Beane=overrated.  Look where the A&#39;s are now. 
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaBilly Beane and Paul Depodesta&#39;s strategy worked pretty well.  But what really helped the Oakland A&#39;s be legitimate contenders were Miguel Tejada, Jason Giambi, and the Big 3.  Almost any team in baseball would win divisions with those players.  Guys like Hatteberg were nice stories, but come on.
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaMy old coach is In this movie
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks fantastic. I can&#39;t wait
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaThe guy puttin on the legging at 0:51 is my baseball coach in Arizona
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@nickmendezTUBE   It&#39;s not Mogwai, it is This Will Destroy You.  The song is called The Mighty Rio Grande
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshita@nickmendezTUBE  It&#39;s not Mogwai, it is This Will Destroy You.  The song is called The Mighty Rio Grande
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitathis stupid trailer makes the movie look so cliche, but knowing brad pitt, theres a reason he picked it, and Capote kicked ass
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaGlad it&#39;s coming, but it seems 7 years late. How did we get The Blind Side before this?
-4QPVo0UIzcdelimeterByIshitaIts going to win a Oscar.. ill bet money on that
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThis. Looks. AWESOMEEEEEEE!!!!!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaomg this is going to be epic 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaScottish. 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaah, yes. You are correct. My point, though true, is moot.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaTotally ready for an Irish Disney Princess
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaNope. Not pathetic in the least. Pixar&#39;s just that good.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaExactly. It may not have been Pixar&#39;s best movie ever, but it was pretty good, all things considered. By what people say, you&#39;d think it was the worst movie ever made in the history of movies...
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaGreat Scott! =B. . . er, how should I have known?
(and then someone tells me I need to brush up on my history) =P
(and I facedesk)
(and I pretend-weep)
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaAm I pathetic because this made me get all teary eyed with joy?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaAh, but none of the three films they mention share producers, directors, screenwriters, cinematographers, etc. 


AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI know I stand alone but I actually thought cars 2 was pretty good!
Not as good, as some of their other films, but I still liked it!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaKilts can also be found in Irish tradition, but you&#39;re right, it&#39;s Scottish here
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitadude. you don&#39;t need to make a guarantee that this movie will be better than cars 2. that&#39; sort of given
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaSo basically her mom turns into the bear... Okay? 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaYou could always spoof it to fit into the time period this movie is set in you know... ;)
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaOMG shes dating their bear lol

AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaSilly peoples, there are different Directors and producer teams at Pixar. This is the team that brought those movies. Different teams did Nemo, Cars, Monsters, etc.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaTHANK YOU
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWhy do you people hate Cars 2?  It certainly wasn&#39;t on the level of the majority of their films, but I loved it.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawaits for wall-e 2....
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird﻿ a&#39; Chuan and it&#39;s sung by Julie Fowlis!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was based in Scotland? 
Yeah I&#39;m Irish American...
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaOf course it does have a kinda cliche plot&#39;s base -- this whole thing of a royalty member rebelling against the perfect and restricted life she/he has been living on --, but I still think it&#39;s going to be a GREAT movie.  As long as Pixar build a lot up around the cliche base idea, like they did with all of their movies (except for Cars 2, lol), Brave is going to be completely amazing and remarkable.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Irish? Er, Ireland-based? The setting? If so, I am sooo finding it amusing, since I have a bit of Irish in me.  =B lol 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaCouldn&#39;t have said it better =) . . . ok, maybe I could, just need some time to put thought into my response. Anyway, I agree. It was by NO means a bad movie.
And critics should remember that this is from the same company that put personalities in desklamps. DESKLAMPS, out of all things! And it was really cool to see! Now imagine they made an advanced, feature-length movie out of that. And you would have something similar to what they did years later. Yep. &quot;Cars&quot;. ;)
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshita:&#39;) &lt;3
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitai like
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaand i love how billy connolly is in it
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaCAN NOT WAIT!!!

this will be a HUGE comeback from the dreadful Cars 2!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this so badly!

AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me, or does it seem that the wish she makes turn her family into bears? If that&#39;s so...okay, awesome...I think lol
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI wonder where the pizza planet truck will be!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaLooks good. Spoiler*** : I think her family will change into bears... 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitalove the song at the end:)
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaFrom the creators of WALL-E, Toy Story 3, Up, notable lack of any film containing talking vehicles...
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s going to be an amazing movie
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaCome on, I didn&#39;t mind Cars 2 but it is by far the worst film that Pixar has made.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;ll be hard to include it in a setting like this, huh?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI love that group :D
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitapixar, you are my goal in life, work for you, IM ON MY WAY
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful Scottish Gaelic! Native speakers, translation please :) 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawow the music at the end was beautiful
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaEvery time I watch these trailers it always reminds me of the Scottish guy from Samurai Jack. 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThere should be more dirt, everything looks too clean.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be the first in line to see this when it comes out.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI can not WAIT for this! If any of the cast ever read this, know I love you, and you inspire me to keep being Brave.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshita@cyanman123 Maybe it&#39;s a wagon.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIf you have the chance to change your Feet, would you?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThe music gives me chills

AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawow
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called &quot;Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A’ Chuainv&quot;.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitado we get A113 in this movie :D ? Really looking foreward to this!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for this﻿ movie to come out. I love the song towards the end of the trailer...so beautoful. Gaelic...such a beautiful language. I cracked up at the part with Merida&#39;s father impersonating her...or trying to XD
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitathe video froze at 1:08 to load. awkward.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaits a pizza cart.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitagoosebumps :3
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI am now proud to have very long + extremely curly red hair...
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWe forgive you Pixar for Cars 2.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaMaybe they&#39;ll have a cheese cart, next to a bread cart, next to a rolling pin vendor! :D
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaPixar has always made my favorite animations.  Looking forward to this one :D
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaCan some one give me the name of the song from 1.50 and forward??
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaOh, King Fergus cracks me up at :45 - :53
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaDid her mom turn into a bear?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing but... nowadays trailers are like watching the whole movie in 2 minutes =_=
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m like you, but that&#39;s just usually because of the god awful attempts at what Americans think the Scottish accent sounds like. But for this film, most of the voice actors actually are Scottish, and it&#39;s Pixar, they always do rakes of research before they start on films because they want to get it right.
I&#39;m hopeful for this one.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitacool, what kind of stuff have you done?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI love love love her hair! I want it! 
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI Love Pixar.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaMaybe there will be a Pizza Planet wagon?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWell.... Looks more realistic than braveheart
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThat looks amazing!!! I feel sorry for the dude who had to do the hair! It came out looking amazing though!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawhy is it every new pixar film come&#39;s out the day day before my birthday in the us???
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWell they don&#39;t have to include the truck. They didn&#39;t have it in The Incredibles. Maybe it&#39;ll be the Pizza Planet wagon in this one
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI really love the accent
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWhy did you have to write an ignorant comment?
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaWhy does she have to be a ginger
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaits that.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaBeing Scottish myself I really hate hearing a Scottish accent in films, its like nails on a chalkboard to me. So I dunno if its that but this really doesn&#39;t look that good to me.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaMark Andrews has confirmed the Pizza Planet Truck will appear in Brave.[2] It was reported that Tia Kratter has hinted that the truck will appear in the Witch&#39;s house.[3]

-Pixarwiki
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitathe song at the end is &quot;Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A’ Chuain&quot; performed by Julie Fowlis
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be totally awesome. I can&#39;t wait!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what the critics thought, I&#39;ll have you know that Cars 2 was awesome, and is among the PIXAR greats. Thumbs up if you agree with John Lasseter that PIXAR don&#39;t make movies for critics!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitacan wait for this !
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaGoing to see this opening day

AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI wonder where the pizza van is in this film
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaYEAH! CANNOT WAIT!! XD
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait for the soundtrack! beautiful song
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s so epic! Can&#39;t wait to watch this movie.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitathumbs up everyone if you think PIXAR captures our imagination.
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song 1:50
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaI think its in August. Not sure
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaSO CLOSE!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitawe dont want ranga female protagonists who fight
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitaLove Pixar!
Future movies about the Lamp please!
AtrDBQ_qmlgdelimeterByIshitanope

jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite movie 👯‍♀️
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song / band starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf67WlthWXk&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a> ???
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita&#39;oh right.. ooohh for the love of God&#39; 😊🤣🤣🤣
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThe best Movie i‘ve ever watched
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe  people thought that was a real boy
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaShe is still wearing makeup....when she’s a boy
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaWho already watch to the beautiful you or you are beautiful Korean drama
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaWhen no puedes gritar, porque no tienes bolas
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaare you sure this isn&#39;t a Porn video?
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf67WlthWXk&amp;t=0m33s">0:33</a> hey that’s tabitha from gotham
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaCan we just talk for a moment about Amanda being Zach Effron look alike 😲😲😲🤯
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI love it
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitatwelfth night 😄😄
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaIm here because i watched it again after years and Im still howling with laughter. I miss this era of teen comedy films. What a classic.
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita&quot;And this is where it gets really complicated&quot;<br><br>You&#39;re joking right!? Cause I had to watch that thing with Duke and Olivia and Monique 20 times before I understood who felt what about who!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThe tampon in the nose scene was mad funny.
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaChildhood movie...┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThey started that whole cycle and i was like woah woah woah hol up hol up hol up wtf is going on?
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m studying twelfth night in school rnand my mum told me aout this movie because it&#39;s &quot;basically twelfth night&quot; and i thought she meant with the themes but literally all their names are the same.  And Illyria is the school too!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThis is a shoujo manga in a shellnut
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s surprising how Amanda said that the reason of her breakdown was seeing herself like a boy, she didn&#39;t like that and get depressed. Like what the hell it&#39;s the cuttest boy I&#39;ve ever seen, I wanna watch the movie just to see Amanda as a guy &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was my childhood
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitahow much i miss old trailer..!!!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI really love how amanda acts

jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the greatest movies
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita21st sentury in a nutshell
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has a cult following and people loved Amanda Bynes&#39; performance because she completely excelled! I was sad to learn that Amanda experienced 6 months of depression after she did this movie because she didn&#39;t like the way she looked as a guy.
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitafuge

jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaJust noticed channing tatum after so many years
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie would completely confuse me me, then I realised that it&#39;s based off Rwelfth Night the Shakespearean play so it makes absolute total sense now.

jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaThis is based of a Shakespearean play called 12th night
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s The Man. An FTM movie before FTM was ever known about. This is cool!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaAmanda was so beautiful in the movie
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita“And this is where it gets really complicated.”<br><br>Tbh I thought at that point I was watching an honest trailer instead of the actual one 😂😂😂

jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaWhos here after reading that magazine lol
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to stop scrolling through the comments before I get more traumatised, but just to educate people - it&#39;s a modernisation of the William Shakespeare play Twelfth Night.
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaShoutout to the Twitter costume bringing me here
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Magic Mike and Tobias Funke!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaAmanda Bynes and Alex Breckenridge look like Miley Cyrus.
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Is it just me or does this soccer play has more nudity than the other...&quot;<br>😁😅😂hehehe indeed it does, bro
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaOne of my fave movie, alongside Sydney White, which both hilariously executed by Amanda Bynes 😂😂😂 love the chemistry between her and Channing-my-love here!
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshitaSo thats what channing tatum looks like? No wonder old ladies fall for him ,he&#39;s hot
jf67WlthWXkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Girls with butts like mine, do not talk to boys with faces like yours.&quot;

73tacUcYIzwdelimeterByIshitaIf there is a word to describe this movie, it&#39;s messy. Not a negative comment. I enjoyed this movie.

arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaNo the least you could do in nothing
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist, the dad is actually gay......
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThey should&#39;ve played John Cena&#39;s Theme song when his scene came up
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitathe best bit was for whom the bell tolls
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitai hear a wilhelm scream in the HongKong Trailer<br>XD
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaAt the end: it&#39;s John cena!!!!!!!!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaSo cringeworthy 😣
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLooks boring as fuck and I usually like Will Ferrell.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best comedies.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitawhere is John Cena
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaMy phone number is 617-605-4458

arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitanice
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaGuys I extremely recommend this movie if u want a good laugh! There is not a dull moment in this movie and will ferrel and mark Wahlberg are great actors in the movie! It is rated PG
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of that song at the end credits of the movie?
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie kinda reminds me of the movie Neighbors like Family Vs. Frat!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitalol i watch it.SO GOOD!!!!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitawhen the cheerleader gets hit pause it quickly when she&#39;s on the ground and you can see her smile like she&#39;s laughing

arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaname the song 0.45 seg? please
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaHighway to hell?Really? As if it is not the 82342743th movie trailer to use highway to hell as ost.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWill Ferell and Mark Wahlberg worked together back then the movie is called The Other Guys
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitalmao I don&#39;t need to watch the whole movie, this is enough.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI Can&#39;t see John Cena in the trailer, where is he ?
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitawhohoo its Mark :-)
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arhMMJx7tCU&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> oooo shit :D Im gonna like this movie!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe music is incredibly unfitting  for Star Trek and there seems to be so much emphasis on action.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaAH HA!!!!!! There is the movie with the scene where Will Ferrell through the ball drunk at a girl. I remember people thinking it was real.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaSomeone get Mark Kermode over here STAT!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaJust in case everyone needs a clue, this movie is for kids, dumbasses! Every idiot is a critic....
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaAnother piece of shit movie by Will Ferrell... great... can&#39;t wait.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve already seen this movie.. I think it was called Step Brothers back then...
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaso that explains the basketball video from months ago
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m loving this new daddy&#39;s home movie starring Will Ferrell, good acting.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe Other Guys the Dad Version.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitathat is my life about my dads in the same room
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitanothing but net !!!!!!!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaNice
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaReading the comments. People are so jaded these days.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLet it be rated PG-13 and not rated R! There&#39;s no red band trailer for this movie!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaMark looked exactly like he did 10 years ago in brothers. It&#39;s kinda crazy he didn&#39;t age lo
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitai could use more cowbells
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaComendy genre is dead
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaGabriel Arthur that actor in transformers 2014 and pain no gain
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaStep Fathers...
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so funny
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking awsome
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaheart full
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Mark just walked off the set for Four Brothers 
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaSo are Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg friends now. Or are they just really good business partners. Just wondering because they keep making movies together.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaomg go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arhMMJx7tCU&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> Travis MacMillan
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaCome on!! I want The other guys 2!!!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaAs long as they don&#39;t lose the adult part of comedy like a lot of the sandler movies have this should be pretty good.  And we did not just see all the best parts lol
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWhole movie for ya<br>First part of the movie: they don&#39;t get along<br>Last part of the movie: they get along and be besties...<br>If that doesn&#39;t happen it&#39;s gonna be a lame twist for me...
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLove this
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitamark walbergs character should be happy that his kids have a dad that is as caring as the character will Ferrell. butt then there would b a diffrent comedy that idk if ppl today can handle let me know will if you want to try a movie like mine ocan we remove the confilct from comedy
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWill Ferrell is funny as hell but marky mark sucks donkey balls -- how does he continue to get acting jobs? He&#39;s not funny, he mumbles his lines in his soft whisper, and his acting is mediocre at best. He&#39;s just not very good -- he must be sucking somebody off pretty good is my guess. No offense to his fans.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitase la ve cheverisima la pelicula
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaFake.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWho knows the song at 1.17 please? Thank you.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaOUCH!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaJust FYI the fists going through dry wall and making Will falling would not happen ... dry wall is very strong if you try to break it &#39;vertically&#39; like that :-)
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe only things that interests me in this trailer.<br>1 ) Highway to Hell<br>2 ) Motorcycles.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaJohn Cena and Will Ferrell, looks good!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI like adam sandler movies....grown ups 1 and 2 are awesome to me...all the hipsters in here hating on adam
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe most exciting thing about this movie is that Linda Cardellini is in it.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaLooks funnier than The Other Guys at least. God the movie was boring as fuck.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitayawwwwwwwwn... this is one Adam Sandler shy of a very painful, played out movie archetype
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaohhhh so that&#39;s what the whole basketball cheerleader was all about
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaDamn it I was hoping for a Barney Stinson movie.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaCool......kinda like step brothers......but the step-dad version
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaWhy couldn&#39;t they have done The Other Guys 2 instead? (sigh)
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else read this as Daddy&#39;s &quot;home movie&quot;?
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaDamn he fucked that cheerleader up that basketball 
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI love Will Ferrell!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe Other Guys again haha
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaanything left to see ?....dumb full plot revealing trailer
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitalol this looks good!!
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I&#39;ve just watched the whole film.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaNO POINT IN SEEING IT NOW I JUST DID
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll catch it on netflix. I wouldn&#39;t pay money for this.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaRed band trailer
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a prime example of why cuckold households always win. They always get the beta male to take care of the Alpha Male&#39;s children. Go ask my kids what their step daddies make.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitathis film looks funny.<br>Love that Highway To Hell song, first heard that song in Little Nicky.<br><br>Nice to see Will Ferrell &amp; Mark Wahlberg back together again, The Other Guys was great.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaYou had me until the motorcycle. I’m so sick of child movie CGI, in movies that will probably, or should be, be rated R.
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaThe film a cheerleader made more from then the box office XD
arhMMJx7tCUdelimeterByIshitaYes
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaClassic trailers? It’s BARELY 10 years old...give me a break we ain’t that old yet.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaShould have been made as a TV series on Netflix. Such good characters and charming young actors. Stranger things before stranger things!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThanks to Peacock Im watching this now funny thing is I had no idea it was 2010 I thought it was 2018 or 2019 😂 looks good..The trailers on YouTube help me to decide on whether or not a movie is worth watching..
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaturns 10 today! <br>Such compelling performances by Chloe Moretz and Kodi-Smitt McPhee. <br>Impressive camera angles and great gore to spare. <br>An impressive remake by Matt Reeves that doesn’t squander the original <br>The child actors are amazing for their ages and I’m glad they don’t shy away from the gore either <br>Great characters that feel they’ve been shunned by the world during the 1980s but form a unique bond nonetheless
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBetter than it has any right to be, although the original is a classic.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaOwen: Will you be my girlfriend?<br>Abby: I&#39;m not a girl!!<br>Owen: What do you mean?<br>Abby: It&#39;s complicated<br>Owen: ohh! okay<br><br>xoxo
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI want watch this again
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaReading the book for the 4th time.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaStill better than Twilight.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitai regret watching this trailer  at 12am not I can’t sleep bro I’m gone
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaWatched this when it first came out and forgot the name.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaSwedish
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen this movie yet, but tonight, we will see the original Swedish version
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m about halfway through the book. Looking forward to seeing this. And hearing how to pronounce those Swedish names...
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaYowie wowie👺👺👺 let me in😈😈
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaIt was made in 2010 why was this made a year ago?
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitabruh i wanted to find this for ages damn finally
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThinking about the movie, I keep calling the bully (Kenny) Clay. My brain won’t stop. I need help. 😂
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaLet me talk..!! <br>Let me talk..!! <br>Let me talk..!! <br><br><br>-Kevin De Bruyne
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaMiss the old days when Chloe is little lol.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3guLR8aBpU&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> Did they delete this scene? I&#39;ve never seen it it the movie. <br><br>(When Abby is in his bed).
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like an american version of another foreign film called “let the right one in”
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitascary but cool all the time watching this movie/film
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaIs cara bueno even in this movie I don’t recall seeing her once
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaGood Flick
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitagood movie
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this movie and I 100% recommend! It’s amazing and it really makes you wonder!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI just finished it 🔥🔥🔥
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaIf you loved this , as I did. Then you need to also watch the Swedish version, which was released before this. It has subtitles of course, it is called (Let the Right One in). Both amazing &amp; both have slight differences
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaSwedish original is alot better
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI saw today, and I can say that it&#39;s an masterpiece . Very very good!!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaMuy buena, 100% recomendada, te mantiene MUY inmerso en la película y lo que podría estar ocurriendo.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaHard to believe it’s been almost 10 years since this movie was released
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie ought to be called &#39;Twilight Jr.&#39;
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaOkay, but, srsly, does anyone know if it ends bad - I mean does the little vampire and/or the boy die?
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBloofer lady.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaKid from The Babadook: Don&#39;t let it in! DON&#39;T LET IT IN! DON&#39;t LET it iNn!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaWho is watching this in this coronavirus crisis the best horror  movie to watch on this times
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe fiend that you
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaReal reason why not to live in a small quiet town
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaYou can watch this for free on PlutoTV On Demand. I think Amazon might have it but you&#39;d have to pay for it there.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie in my opinion is a lot more depressing than scary. The film is about two outcasts who accept each other for who they are I like the remake I have yet to see the original if anyone could provide an online link it would be much appreciated
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBut like doesn’t everyone need blood to live
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis doesn&#39;t look scary.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaAnd I&#39;m burning, I&#39;m burning, I&#39;m burning , I&#39;m burning for youuuuu
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe PewDiePie version is better
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaNo, stop. See the Swedish version, it is the <b>true</b> masterpiece.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaIs is a crappy str8 version of a great Swedish movie
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t take the title of this film seriously.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis excellent remake is much better from Swedish original!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitawhen i was like 6 i saw this movie at my grandma’s house and i’ve been looking for it for a while because this movie traumatized me as a child 😌🙈
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaEven though this movie had jackshit to do with the original book, I still enjoyed it.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaOh noooo.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBeutiful movie, read the book too and just an amazing story
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaUna de las mejores peliculas que e  visto no es de terror auque lo paresca
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaWho is the watching fiend wwe after
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBray Wyatt “let me in”
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaHas none of the subtlety, atmosphere, charm or soul of the original.   This version has been made for a more mainstream audience. And for less mature viewers with a shorter attention span. The cartoonish looking vampire effects when she was jumping around made this film into just another tacky, mainstream audience Hollywood horror film.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaJust watched the Movie, Man LOVED IT !!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaLet me out
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe other version is very good and more but I prefer this.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaWait, was these the remake one of Let The Right One In, cause I watched both.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaGive this man a Batman movie to direct!!!!
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaTrailer makes her look like the villain and more horror, she&#39;s not. The bullies are, and it&#39;s a vampire romance.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI read the book
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaoriginal was much better
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaSo boring at the started I just watched this movie movie for Chloe
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaNot much good
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaGran pelicula c:
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaنبغا جز جديد
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaNice remake the movie hollywood..but the best orginal movies swedish novel...
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe best vampire movie I&#39;ve seen, truly a masterpiece
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaOriginal version is better
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is crap. Completely a bad copy of “let the right one in”
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so f*<b>***</b> dumb first of all they got police breaking in people houses then they got this dumb funny looking white boy kissing a monster in the mouth that&#39;s how you know white folks made this movie
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBook is better, a lot better.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaMatt Reeves brought me here 🦇
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen both versions and honestly I like this remake better. The original Swedish film is a very good film as well, but this version is a lot darker in tone and I found it more emotional than the original.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaCrap. Watch Let the Right One In
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaNot bad but the original (swedish) movie is better.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaAll the people on here bashing the american version yet they clicked on the video. Thats what we call irony lol.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaFor you who don&#39;t know, this is American version of the Swedish movie Låt den rätte komma in (Let the right one in).
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE SUCKS
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaNice
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaLet me in...... <b>LET ME IIIINNNN!!!</b>
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaLet me in LET ME IIAAAAIAIAIAIAIGAHAHGAHAi
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI prefer the same movie but in the Swedish version, since it&#39;s scarier and desolate.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie in Goodwill May 25th 2019. I saw tha title so I looked at it. On tha front it says... THE BEST AMERICAN HORROR FILM IN THE LAST 20 YEARS <br>-Steven King. <br>If King says that... it&#39;s gotta be true. I haven&#39;t watched it yet.  Probly tonight.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaBad movie, do not waste your time with b movie sht like this.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never seen this but the vampire girl looks like Hermione granger while the original girl vampire looks perfect.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaIs this the American version of &#39;Let The Right One In&#39;?
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaTunnel Scène was Creepy
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThis isnt Eric Andre
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI WATCH IT AND I SHIP THE BULLIED BOY WITH THE VAMPIRE  GIRL (Abby x Owen)
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer makes the movie seem a lot better that it actually is
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve watched this before long time ago and i was wondering if where could i find the full movie
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaoriginal is better, no offense, but Hollywood sucks!  Too commercial, no art.
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m bored watching this movie. I started because I liked Richard Jenkins in &quot;The Visitor.&quot;
x3guLR8aBpUdelimeterByIshitathis is okay but the original is creepier

WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitai love this film sfm! so under appreciated! <br>one thing i did not understand was, why did duncan have some of the names in korean- hangul or romanization? like 사랑 / sarang??
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis actor s oscar was long overdue...
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI am the one and only... nobody I&#39;d rather be 🎶🎙🎸😎
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaWarcraft brought me here.  Thanks Duncan Jones👍
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshita240p?!?
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaDamn fine movie!
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best si fi film that I ever have seen. There is no way back.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaTen minutes was enough. Dude. Beard. Backwards hat confusion. &quot;You know what I mean?&quot;. No. Logan&#39;s Run sets. Bad 80&#39;s graphics. Kevin Spacey as HAL. Yawn. Babe. Fuck. Know what I mean? No.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaso we meet again 240p
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaİzlerken ağladım <br>Evimi çok özledim
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaSam Rockwell delivered an outstanding performance in this.  I never heard of it and kinda watched it onna whim--turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen but never heard of prior.  It&#39;s an exposition on the psychological effects of social isolation.  It&#39;s done in such a credible way that it feels like you&#39;re the director of an actual clinical, psychological experiment and you&#39;re watching the results as a first-party observer, with third-party omniscience.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE SUCKS THE CAWK
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThere was a movie about a mining town in, I think Pennsylvania, something happened the town was evacuated. And the population moved to a town on the moon. Anyone know the name of this movie? It was the late 80s or early 90s, I think.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaGuys help me, i did not see the trailer or the movie but i accidentally read the description where it says that he finds a clone of himself or something like that, is that the spoiler? Answer honestly please
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaPeople need to stop talking about moon, it&#39;s the Martian but borring
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaonly 3 years? ha noob
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI have only heard good things about the movie, but, what an absolutely horrendous piece of shit trailer this is. Whoever created this is in the wrong line of work. I&#39;m torn between checking it out or fucking it off. Based on the fact no one has ever been to the moon, I&#39;m probs going to fuck it off. Fantasy genre has never been my slice of pie... hmmm
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshita240p lol
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitathis movie is great
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaSam rocks even the moon
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThe Sam&#39;s are both clones because the mining company wants to save money.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis is good stuff
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitalike Moon movie
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaA masterful performance from Rockwell. Great story as well.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI love these kind of movie cuz at the beginning you dont know what isd going on. but at the end everything gets clear! its like an puzzle.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaWARNING THIS COMMENT HAVES SPOILERS!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>he will never go home becuase he is a clone.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis is such an good movie! please believe me! you must watch this! this isnt a weird movie its so good!
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI saw the movie without watching the trailer, thank god i did.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaTrailers like this one must have a spoiler alert on. I was lucky enough and I saw it before seeing the trailer.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaso glad I saw this movie without watching the trailer so the big twist wasn&#39;t spoiled for me
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is very confusing
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked. Typical Hollywood crap.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitathe <b>only</b> fault in this &#39;film&#39; is that it was <b>made</b>
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI loved it curtis or whatever that robot was sooo cute
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaGood morning Moon fans! How are you feeling? :)
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaso, how many times the guy&#39;s copied?
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaWent into watching the movie as a fan of Sam Rockwell. Finished watching the movie and I instantly became a fan of Duncan Jones.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitathis movie is a good one
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshita240p FTW...
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI stopped halfway because I was suddenly very interested, and immediately got the impression it&#39;s one of those extremely annoying trailers that contain a lot of spoilers. I&#39;ll go see the movie now...
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI really likes this film! Can anoyne suggest similar SciFi movies to me, preferably without any (or at least not much) love story?
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitai created this in lego
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaOmg I have loved this actor since the hitchhiker guide to the galaxy I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t hear about this movie.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitathanks..x
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaNice Movie..worth the time..x
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitai really love this filme so much
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaCopycat!!
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaawesome movie. worth every credit. Deserves so much more. Great movie soundtrack from Clint.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis and Ex Machina are the best sci-fi movies made in the last years.<br>Both are better than Interstellar. Man, fuck Interstellar (full of plot holes).
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaomg.....its frank underwood...
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaone of the better movies .....
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaVery unique movie! I love it! Sam Rockwell did a brilliant job!<br>Moon is one of the most underrated and overlooked Sci-Fi films of the 2000&#39;s - next to Mission to Mars, Supernova, The Cell, Pandorum, Serenity, Cargo, Sunshine, Eagle Eye, The 6th Day, Equilibrium, XChange, Gamer, Ultraviolet, Push, Signs, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Evolution, Star Trek: Nemesis, Starforce, The Box, The Day After Tomorrow, A Sound of Thunder, Doom, Jurassic Park 3, Children of Men, Cypher, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Death Race, Hollow Man.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, I loved it.  But I wouldn&#39;t call a 2009 movie a classic &quot;SonyPicturesClassics&quot;  
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis is a great movie. I saw it randomly one day. Definitely a film that was unfairly over-looked.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI do hope this is played in the USA.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaYou relise, even in space people can have sex. Just because its the &quot;future&quot; doesn&#39;t mean guys and girls lose their penises and vaginas....  Anyway, you have probally read what Ian-John wrote to you. So you know that its not a sex scene.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaHave you seen the movie? If you had, you would know it&#39;s not a sex scene and I don&#39;t think you would be trolling. And this was an independent financed production, nothing to do with &#39;hollywood&#39;.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitai love Gerty :)
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of my all time favorite movies. 
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaI love this film !!! :)))))
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaYou mean that obvilion is similar to this one.

WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitasimilar to oblivion.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant, intriguing, well-acted &amp; directed but so underrated film. It deserved bigger recognition
The decade 2000-2009 had so many underrated SCI-FI films - this one, Children of Men, Sunshine, Supernova, Mission to Mars, The Cell, Ultraviolet, Equilibrium, Cube 2, Serenity, Signs, Hulk, Avatar (2004), Evolution, Pandorum, Push, A Sound of Thunder, Gamer, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The 6th Day, Jurassic Park 3, The Box, The Fourth Kind, Cargo, The Forgotten, The Chronicles of Riddick etc
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaahh- ok- didn&#39;t understand.   But it IS cool how you don&#39;t know the reason for the 2nd Sam from the trailer.  
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaawesome movie and soundtrack  Nailed NIB mint  slipcase-version of Blu-ray for $10 shipped from ebay :D
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaIt does not.   The trailer makes you think about several possibilities for the 2nd Sam-  Imagined? First Sam dead and new one is ghost? Time warp and 1st Sam sees himself out there near dead later? Clones?   Bottom line-  You don&#39;t know UNTIL you watch the movie.
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitathis movie is amazing, you will not regret it
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever!
WWoDBcSW4_cdelimeterByIshitagreat movie watch it

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaI enjoyed it, could have done without the crappy romance.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaDjimon Hounsou&#39;s presence elevated the entire movie.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaNever knew this was amber heard.  She looks way skinner now especially her face now.  Both hot though

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaAnd you&#39;re only happy when you&#39;re causing fights?  ... &quot;everybody has his fight&quot;... reminds me of being in a car with my Mum.  Some guy started yelling at me - I was driving.  But before I could think of a response, my Mum starts yelling back at him. ... It ovcurred to me that God was like that - that one did not have to fight but He would respond, as he did to Aaron and Miriam when they murmured - complained about Moses taking a black woman to be his wife.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaMy favourite motivational movie

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaLove ittttt..... Got goosebumps as I am an mma fighter

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaMiss 2008
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshita10 years later and I still enjoy the hell out of this movie
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaIf you like this movie then watch the movie Showdown. It was made in 1993. Basically it&#39;s JUST like this movie but showdown came first.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tc-RPjZRm8&amp;t=1m17s">1:17</a> What is the song?
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBest movie ever
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBest movie ever seen
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitai remember watching this movie while in Bulgaria&#39;s seaside on holiday i was like 8 maybe
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitathis movie made me start training and to learn MMA and stuff like that it inspired me hopefully it can inspire u &lt;3
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitayou know what doesn&#39;t make sense they put the title for this trailer Never Back Down (2008) Official Trailer - Amber Heard, Cam Gigandet, and not Sean Faris included in the title i mean like....he&#39;s the hero in the story so why didn&#39;t they put his name on the trailer&#39;s title?
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitawhats the songs name at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tc-RPjZRm8&amp;t=0m13s">0:13</a>? - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tc-RPjZRm8&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a>
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is so great and inspirational at the same time. The Vibe trailer gives out is very misleading, and makes it seems as another typical teenage action flick. Maybe that&#39;s why the movie is somewhat underrated. Don&#39;t care for the reviews, just watch it.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaEvan peters!!!?!?,BABY

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBest movie ever but this trailer tho 😩
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitafeels like this could become a manga plot
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaI can imagine this movie inspired so many to train and never back down. Hell I saw this again after 7 years and still have that feeling
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaAMBER is just a mockery to all real victims of abuse, inacceptable and it&#39;s a shame ! a girl too stupid without brain
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitathe best movie for me
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaOMG I love this film haven&#39;t seen since it first came out
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaHahahahaha I just ordered this movie on Blu Ray and I still can&#39;t help but love this shitty movie hahaha. I also can&#39;t believe I commented almost a year ago.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBest movie trailer of all time. It takes the cake
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshita1 is better than 2
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaSince when are high school kids this old? Damn I&#39;m in college and no one here looks this old

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitastill remember going to see it the very first day it drop. love it
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaThis might be my favourite movie (not film) of all time. I came for entertainment and I got more than enough. Great, great movie I have no idea why it got such bad reviews smh 10/10
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaWhat if the girl simply left the bad guy ???
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBRAHHHH!!!!!! WHAT WAS THAT SONG THAT CAME ON?????? IT&#39;S SOOO GOOD.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitavery soft mix martial arts
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t this movie come out in theaters? For some reason i have some memory of watching it in theaters.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitasuch a good movie
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitahustle brought me here
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaSHRIMP WRESTLING.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBORING. you could expect that &quot;the good guy&quot; wins the girl and lives happy ever after. shitty movie.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaThus movie was so bad it&#39;s such a guilty pleasure movie for me. But Amber Heard being in it was the first time I realized that she would have some kind of career in Hollywood. Johnny Depp is damn lucky to be married to that sexy piece of ass.

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaWhat kind of asshole invites a guy who is new in school to a party  to get his ass kicked without a previous warning... she&#39;s a bitch
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaMusic?
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaCam plays the bad guy so well!! Without a doubt, he is one of the most underrated actors ever.
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaI love this movie.....
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaha ha good stuff
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaIs there any similar movie, besides this and Brothers ?!
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaBb
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitathis film is so motivational
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaFull on class film like, such a sick MMA film, along with &#39;Warrior&#39;, proper action! 
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaNever back down! The black guy is the best, and the guy who fights Capoeira, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tc-RPjZRm8&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tc-RPjZRm8&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> hahaha

2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshitaCrap movie. 
2tc-RPjZRm8delimeterByIshita:&#39;) awuevo jeje yo la tengo la tenia pss
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI honestly think that while this trailer is one of the best trailers that I&#39;ve ever seen, the movie that it was portraying was not that great. It was alright, but not the absolute suspenseful invigorating experience that I was hoping for. It is honestly a culmination of all of the generic mafia cliches that we have seen millions of times before, without that much of a coherent story. At least that&#39;s what I think.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWe hart hartnett sent me here... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlbN5cQKZik&amp;t=2m15s">2:15</a>
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaNever get sick of watching both the trailer and movie✊️
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t get enough of ryan&#39;s micky mouse voice in the movie<br>btw, that grinding you hear on the soundtrack is actually nick nolte talking
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI have heard that Sean Penn plays Micky Cohen lika a Batman Villian. Is that true ?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitawhat a bad movie, script was taken from untouchables, some scenes are too stupid to be true, like throwing hand grenades from one car to a other car, without anyone getting hurt!!!!<br>the car chase scenes are so so so bad!!!!!!!!, watch the trailer u wont have to watch horrible movie!,<br>it have this disney movie feeling, 1 white guy: check!!!, 1 mexican guy: check!!!, 1 black guy..check!!! did they even have mexican and black cops in 1930-1940s america??, and if they did, they were street cops, not special agents, america at that time was very racist!, this movie covers up historical accuracy! <br>the final shoot out so, so , so bad!, like 20 gangsters infront of a buildign against 5 cops...ooh and the gangsters dont act dirty or sneaky, they wait for the cops to get out, to shout at them, and wait for the cops to start shooting at them!..<br><br>watching this movie for free, and turned it off,  the final shootout is stupid, they have full automatic weapons, but the cops take cover behind their cars, like cars are bullet proof!!!!, its stupid!, unrealistic!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the film music name?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlbN5cQKZik&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a> i shee what you did there
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitanow that&#39;s a trailer.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaA mob movie ...where the main characters are fucking 🐷s🤨🤢
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI know this is  a 2013 film, but I&#39;m kinda tired of Ryan and Emma.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLove the trailer, the movie and would love to see a unit like this in my country.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOh My God - Jay Z
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitagood  lord

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so bad-ass!!!!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitag0od movie.watch at
iwantmovies.info
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitagood fucking trailer
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaNothing like L.A. Noire.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaDo someone know know the song from the trailer?

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI just watched Alex Cross on DVD &amp; that was even worse than this pile of dreck. The rest of the comments here must have been bought by WB
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI was the only one in the theater Too but it was horrible, it was the first showing but who wants to buy $10 for just the movie then $20 for a drink and small popcorn, that is just for yourself
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLoved the film
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI liked the movie
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaGreat actors, horrible movie I was the only one in the theater
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaJay Z- Oh My God.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaTerrible trailer, epic movie.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever, amazing cast I loved this movie. Thinking of seeing a second time lol
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaTime for L.A Noire!!!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaSong name from 1:05?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best movie I have seen in 2013. 
Probably will see it more few times. worth it. 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitavaaaaardooooc 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaRyan Gosling, I like anything he is in. I first saw him in a 1990&#39;s movie &quot;Remember The Titans,&quot; and next in the Notebook. Just finished watching the Trailer, I&#39;m going to see the movie.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshita&lt;3
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOr Mafia II/Mafia I
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI find that to be the case in a lot of films,(or trailers.) Especially action films. I don&#39;t go to the cinema to watch typical action films anymore because I find the story to be dull and boring, but I&#39;ll definitely go see this one.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this movie!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitathis movie was phenominal. Best I&#39;ve seen in the past 5 years, possibly best to date
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaFinally,something like L.A. Noire
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWhat is that Song
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshita+1 for Emma Stone
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitawhy the fuck they changed penns face??
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is gonna be off tha hinges, can&#39;t wait to go check it out tomorrow.

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;black guy&quot; is Anthony Mackie and he&#39;s an amazing actor (sexy too). They weren&#39;t slaves in the 30s...they had actual jobs...they just couldn&#39;t fraternize with non blacks. People read way too much into movies.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitai am a bible salesman.LOL
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t it our time, Mr. Hand?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOh My God - Jay Z
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaSean Penn looks like Freddy Kruger here =)

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI thought i already saw LA Confidential....but this looks different.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaawesome! they made LA Noire the movie!! oh wait....
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaA black man and a latino as police men in the 1930&#39;s? 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaSean penn dies in the end and Emma stone too, fucking sucky movie
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitamust see
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaGood touch using Jay-Z&#39;s Oh My God
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis deserves much more views...
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitasomehow it remids me of untouchables
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI have a male one. Wanna hook up?
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI think it looks good!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI got a female boner watching this. Looks epic.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLMAO! I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t the only one thinking that.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOne more thing, that is a rather interesting mix of actors in this movie. Some of them are old timers, and others are emerging from the limelight.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis is somewhat like L.A. Confidential with hints of influence from Quentin Tarantino.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaSHE IS CHEATING SPIDERMAN!!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitalike i said mate its a film,and if studios are to show sensitivity they cant show anything in film from a tsunami,to earthquake to flight crashes,bombs and even guns coz everywhere a human being would have felt pain through some incident.people should also realize its film and nothing  more.but still lets see how this re-edited movie shows,i feel it may have been messed up a bit coz of final alterations so suddenly,pity coz it had the markings of an epic cops vs gangster movie 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is perfect!

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaJanuary? Isn&#39;t that the world is gonna end on December this year. OMG. LOL
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI believe Warners showed something called sensitivity in reshooting this movie. Good call.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitanot as good as the first trailer,somehow the theater scene made more sense and the Chinatown scene seems forced and fake a bit,maybe because we know it was shot later,kinda sad they changed the movie,after all it IS A movie and should be taken in that spirit,nothing more.anyway still have hopes coz of good actors and coz the trailer is cool,hope the editing didn&#39;t damage the movie. 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaRyan is the SEXIEST mothafuckin gangster. 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaDamn, no theater shootout bit....
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis about my 78 time watching this.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitathis looks way too polished, glossy, and over the top.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitakeeen
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaso sam is a gangster now
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitafeels like i&#39;m playing LA Noire all over again! :D can&#39;t wait for this movie!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to have to watch this when it comes out.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t gangsters these days be like this anymore?

I could defend myself against these guys.

I can&#39;t with the gangsters of today.

I&#39;d die laughing at them first.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, dont like the trailer song. Doent really match with the era 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitai watched this for ryan gosling
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThe Untouchables meets L.A. Confidential. Rock on!  Keeping it gangster old-school style.  I&#39;m SOOOO going to see this.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaI think everyone should calm down it&#39;s a trailer I doubt the song will be on the soundtrack
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitasmh -.- what a surprise 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOh no the fuck he di&#39;int!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking great!!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaMickey Cohen died in his sleep in 1976. Spoiler.......
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks really good. I need to watch this, like now!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitamy favorite movie already.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaOMG looks great!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitai was thinking about the music you hear in games like LA noire or mafia or in boardwalk empire.
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaBecause they didn&#39;t have &quot;gangster&quot; music back then. The music industry wasn&#39;t like what it is today. 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re kidding right? She can act and she&#39;s friggin gorgeous. 
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaThan what would you call the TV movie/show that&#39;s coming from Frank Darabont on HBO based on the book/game LA Noire ??
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t there some gangster music from the &#39;40s in this trailer that would complete it !!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaL.A Noire the movie should be the name!
LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitamann....every dialogue is epic....u r gonna be begging for a bullet b4 its over....

LlbN5cQKZikdelimeterByIshitaL.A. Noire

YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson taken 4 lol
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaHe still has a career? You&#39;d think after the racist, homophobic, and anti-semitic comments he&#39;s made he&#39;d be out of a job.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson would be great Joel from The Last of Us.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaGlad to see Mel Gibson as crazy as he is he&#39;s a hell of an actor
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see an &quot;Old Man Max&quot; movie now.<br>Just because the amazing beard.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson still has a career?!

YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaoh so mel gibson is still doing movies that&#39;s prettty cool i guess (does he still hate jews though??)
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaGood to see Mel Gibson back in action
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail made me think it was Mad Max
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaOk Mel, I see you!
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel. Yes.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel is back!
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaGibson could play Wolverine.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaPoor man&#39;s Mad Max.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMad Max at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5O562cn0c&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a>
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitamad max before mad max
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like &quot;Get the Gringo&quot; in serious.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaTaken 4
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson looks like he could have still played Mad Max. Tom Hardy is great, but Mel Gibson is perfect for the role.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaI would like to see a Mel Gibson movie, but after what he said about the Jews.. so no, I won&#39;t see any of his new movies.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaLethal Weapon 5??!!

YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaI seen the thumbnail and thought of The last of us
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitagibson&#39;s scream at the end gives me chills
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks litt 🔥🔥
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaGuys, just because it has a father and daughter relationship in it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s similar to The Last of Us. This looks nothing like it.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaracist ass melly Gibson finally making a movie
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the last of us rip off that is not even going to be relevant
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaI really want Mel in the next Mad Max as a really old grizzled road warrior and father/grandfather figure to the new Max.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitasuch a Mad Max tone holy shit
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaGIVE ME BACK MY DAUGHTER
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaMel Gibson should play as Joe for the last of us The movie. I would go and watch that any day.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaspoiler: Mel dies
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad that the movie got good reviews. It sets Mel in the positive direction that he has been looking for, for some time now.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshita&quot;Dad, I need cash fast&quot;, I cringed so hard.
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitanah im good

YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaIf he a killer or something
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or did the video thumbnail looked like a movie from Last of us?
YR5O562cn0cdelimeterByIshitaYou had me at Mel Gibson

XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaImage looks fantastic, I expect nothing less from Roger Deakins! Maybe this time he&#39;ll get the Oscar he deserves.

XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaI hope he says, &quot;I&#39;M COOK!!!&quot; in the movie~.haha~.but wow!!! this looks impressive~. 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaReally interested how Angelina Jolie has directed this. From the trailer it seems like it&#39;s a great movie. But we have to wait and see. 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another movie that is trying way too hard to he inspirational.
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaI love the book this would be awesome 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaCook :)
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaONly highlight of this film is that it is directed by Angelina Jolie

XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaJesus christ Jack O&#39; connell has gone far! This is defiantly going to boost his career much further in terms of getting bigger roles in hollywood! Who would know that a person who comes from a working class background such as myself who would go so far! It shows that through determination and never giving up you can achieve anything, and from watching this trailer it seems he&#39;s acting is going to be by far his best. 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good but this trailer shows too much.
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaI loved the book! Now this is going to be an awesome movie for me. kinda cried a little for no reason. 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaWell well cook if effy could see you now ;)
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m biased because I wanna watch this for Miyavi (the japanese guy at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrjJbl7kRrI&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a>) but damn, I&#39;m gonna watch this for the plot line. 
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaGod damn, he got skinny for this one.
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaI MUST SEE THIS ASAP!!!!!!!!

XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitathat gave me chills
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaFIST
XrjJbl7kRrIdelimeterByIshitaFirst
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaShit!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaEnjoyable film, I watched by mistake thinking it was Tom Hardy version but kept on watching anyway and well acted film.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaIf they hand out oscars for best over acting. These guys may be in with a shot.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone got any idea what the soundtrack to the trailer is? Some nice dubstep right there.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWOW! This looks absolutely fuckin shit!!!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLooks low budget (like most brit films) and not very good. 
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaIn this film Ronnie makes me laugh so much it&#39;s unreal but of course in real life he was terrifying. Not a good casting selection.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLegend just shit on this movie 😂
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaDoes the film reveal how Ronnie and Reggie used to supply the elite with young boys for sex?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawatched it... it&#39;s a waste of space.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaGecko Brothers knock off.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaCan someone tell me what is the name of the song at the end of the movie? Starts after THE END - OF THE RISE...
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI watched this two nights ago it wasn&#39;t awful but wasn&#39;t great worth a watch if you don&#39;t pay for it
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhat a fuckin steaming great pile of shit this film is. I am halfway through watching it at the moment. It is that bad I just had to press pause and come on to youtube to slate it ! I will not even go back to watch the second half it is that bad. The Krays film from 1989 with the kemp brothers wasn&#39;t brilliant but it was better than this absolute bollocks. At least the Kemp brothers had a tiny bit of a look of Ron and Reg. Do not bother watching this nonsense people. One of the worst films I have ever seen ! (well, ive seen the first half anyway).
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitajust watched this on blu ray.and was crap and boring.could not act its funny.nothing like the first one.waste of money.dont waste your time on this.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitalooks crap tom hardys legend looks more real
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLove it!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLooks cheap
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitalol own it.  downloaded it, watched this trailer and deleted it.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThere was some confusion on showbox this afternoon and ended up watching this film. Epic fail!!! I was relieved when I saw there were only a few minutes left but the ending was without doubt bloody shit!!!!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita&quot;own it!&quot; no thanks
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so shit. The kemp brothers and tom hardy will do this justice not these tits
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawhat s the name of the song?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThat looks awful!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not that bad. Looking forward to part 2 The Fall of the Krays which should be on blu ray by the end of the year
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ChEerbVbcE&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a> only good part of this horrid movie
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitais this a film or a &quot;try &amp; get 2 actors who look completely different to the characters&quot; competition???
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWould rather watch Legend ;)
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaShitty copy cat movie, just wait for Legend, fuck this shit!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhats the Soundtrack?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhats the Soundtrack?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI thought the film was called &#39;Legend&#39;? or are there 2 films out at the same time, about the same thing?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know about the movie but what I know is that the soundtrack is Epic!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaOkay people, is it worth to watch?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawho stars in this film ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitathem actors dont even look intimidating.    tom hardy on the other hand
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI was only able to see half of the film; because I could waste my life no further. Boring film if you ask me. 5/10. Salutations from, USA!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhat a fuk. Tom hardy&#39;s krays coming out soon. They tried to fuk his movie up like they did with san andreas  rock&#39;s movie with an othr bullshit sanandrea movie.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaBACKGROUND MUSIC PLEASE GUYS ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhats that ending soundtrack name?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawhats the other krays film  just released  in the cinema looks a lot better,you aways get one good film then a shit film tryin to cash in
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitathe song name please...
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitabeat name ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThis seems like something Asylum would poop out, only shinier... but a golden turd is still a turd!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this, Its just laughable how shit it is. The guy playing Ronnie he really doesn&#39;t suit playin him at all, I don&#39;t think he comes across as menacing at all,
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhy would they bring out a film about the krays with unknown actors and bad quality at the same time &#39;legend&#39; comes out?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the trailer soundtrack ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThe best bass movie trailer ;D my woofer liked that
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is nuts.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhen you show boob in the preview, you sold a movie ticket.   end of trailer.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhahahaahhahahaha the look to nice what a joke
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaA Rip Off To &quot;Legend&quot; lmao jesus not even gonna waste my time
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaRiiise of the Kraken!!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ChEerbVbcE&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a> &quot;...WE ARE UNTOUCHHHHABLLLLEEE!!!!&quot;  The cheesiness is literally dripping from that scene, ill definitely watch it, but from some random publication to rate it as best british gangster movie ever..hahahaha, come on. That award goes to classics like &#39; The Long Good Friday&#39; (1979) &#39;Get Carter&#39; (1971) and to a lesser extent some of the comedy/gangster stuff Guy Ritchie directed in the late 1990s/early 2000s... ie Lock stock/Snatch.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita&quot;He wont take his pills&quot;- So bad ass.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitathis movie is great..<br>any other mafia movies like it?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitacrap
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaSeems like there is a distinct lack of Tom Hardys in this film.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaIts a shame that this film was released to coincide with the realse of Legend.  In it&#39;s own rights this film is ONE OF the best british gangster films of all time.  The acting filmography  was reminiscent of Bronson.  The violence is second to none and pretty constant! Overall this film would give Legend a run for its money and should not be dissregarded just because they&#39;ve tried to rip off a Hollywood blockbuster. If you&#39;re in to British Gangster films you will LOVE this film. Give it a chance... you will not regret it! (P.s. The ending is a little weak and could have done with something with a little more impact.)
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaAny idea who did the soundtrack on this trailer? That Industrial rock is sick!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitalooks horrific
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawow that acting was horrible and thats only the trailer. imagine watching the whole film
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaKinda looks cheesy tbh , and the actors look b grade lol
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a parody starring Stephen Colbert.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitalegend beats this
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitacant believe the same bloke who made this made rise of the foot soldier (a must watch). Gangster no1 a gud old brit gangster flick, also try watching bronson  played by tom hardy whos playing ron and reg in legend.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitathis has the production values of an underfunded episode of button moon, don&#39;t bother<br>wait for the Tom Hardy Film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Legend">#Legend</a>
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ChEerbVbcE&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a> who is that?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWhat a load of garbage. They even had to throw in dubstep.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaTHAT SHIT KRAY!!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitadoes anybody know the name of the song pls ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawhat an insult I hope this film flops
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLegend looks good and all but definitely wanna see this British version. The way it should be! Footsolider style YOU MUG!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitadont look so good . What a shame .. Love Honor and Obey . thats a proper classy gangsta film . London gangsta films are poop of late .
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaOmg the acting was just terrible but worth watching to just gawp at dickie :p
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaits just using &quot;legend&quot; as free advertisment,  as most straight  to dvd movies do these days, but this looks complete bollox,  they dont look anythin alike
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaSong name ?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaAnybody know the song?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaGangster british films are boring...
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitai watched it and it was amazing !!!! i went to the premier and got to meet the actors and some of the crew and it was a great night :)
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaTom Hardy?
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaJumping on the bandwagon only this crap has only one wheel, gave it 5 mins watching the same toffs acting hard just like Green Street. Avoid and wait for alleged as this....ain&#39;t Legend.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThey should not make two films about the same thing so close IF, the subject is of real events. If they&#39;re fictional, that&#39;s fine with your two Jungle Book movies, two Hercules movies and two White House movies but when you have two Enzo Ferrari biopics and two Kray biopics so close to each other, there has to be a line drawn.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI hate how they release 2 movies on things close apart
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita&quot;the best british gangster film ever made&quot; lmao for some strange reason I kinda doubt that!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI liked the original film. The trailer for this new film does not encourage me as much as I hoped. Might be better than it first looks!
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaWatched it on rent. Quite enjoyed it. Photography was good, acting was ok, sound track was good, script was ok. Just wished reg looked tougher. Also cringed to see a PVC double glazed house in a 1950s east. End street. Above all it&#39;s a good film.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure wardrobe could have made kevin Leslie look a bit more rugged as Reg Kray. Looks like a well shot film.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like arse
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaLegend obviously had the bigger budget but this looks grimy and gripping like a british gangster movie should.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaForget this.  They don&#39;t look anything like the twins.  The Tom Hardy film looks much more closer to the real truth and portrayal of both brothers
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitawhat a crock of shit
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaAnd then Tom Hardy showed up...
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitadirty peado bastards
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ChEerbVbcE&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a>...lol.
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaNothing like them can&#39;t they get it right by now
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ChEerbVbcE&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a> looks the best bit
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitalooks shit
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitait cant be any worse than the kemp brothers film
7ChEerbVbcEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing going to have to see this, looks brilliantly made with great acting a must watch for me ❤️
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitasong at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a>?
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song with the ukulele called?
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaAgent 47-brothers in arms
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaIt is going to be a freaking movie of this type

_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitathat trailer was pretty much the whole movie plot
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaI find very interesting what he says about the gun detaching you from the guilt of your actions...
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshita&quot;The Brothers Grimsby&quot; is my ticket to see this hilarious spy comedy. Between these two performances by Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong work each other as clunky brothers who will stop taking over the world is great. I wanted to see Sacha Baron Cohen&#39;s comedic antics and this should be another Cohen&#39;s comedy like &quot;D Ali G,&quot; &quot;Borat,&quot; &quot;Bruno,&quot; and &quot;The Dictator.&quot;
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitashut up and take my money
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a shame Grimsby is potrayed like a shitty town knowing it used to be one of the wealthiest in the UK.

_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaAh i always love the knowledge that Sacha Baron Cohen will piss off all the PC doucebags.
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitai guess i saw the the whole story in this Trailer
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it that the big fat landwhale is supposed to be some sort of comedian but nothing she says is ever funny. Ever.
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaAustin powers and Dr. Evil
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaFunniest videos
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaSo the older brother is like the guy from dumb and dumber
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaoh I&#39;m watchin it!
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaWow the first 24 seconds actually looked like a good movie, then the rest of the trailer came along...
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaLol SUCK IT<br>Alright what would you like to have written on your gravestone?<br>SUCK IT!!
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the song is at the very beginning at the title screen?
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=1m24s">1:24</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=1m32s">1:32</a> &quot;Ya can&#39;t hit us!

_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitawhat about blackbeard
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie about a couple months back, by far one of the funniest movies I&#39;ve ever seen, this trailer does not do it justice. Seriously though FUNNIEST movie you will probably ever see!
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaSong at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a> is Hollering Hearts by Josh Pyke. Really good song!

_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitamy reaction: XD
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaDamn thought this was gonna be one of those stereotypical spy movies.....I was right
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaUkranian Ben Affleck
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaThe font for &quot;suck it&quot; on the gravestone should not be in Arial, but courier new.
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaGot exite at 9 seconds till 28 seconds
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaif I am correct at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> that is Annabelle Wallis in the scene with  Sacha Baron Cohen if not then let me know who that is
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaF*** Brian May! He&#39;s the only guy who can play Freddie.
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitaLove how people from Grimsby hate seeing their shitty town portrayed as a shitty town.
_YtclB_02wAdelimeterByIshitawow, something by sony not relying on pop culture references, religious bigotry, trends, or memes.... I MUST OF GONE INSANE, if this was on a greenlight, I&#39;d upvote it! Yeah, I&#39;ve either been enlightened or gone insane. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtclB_02wA&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> The line &quot;don&#39;t worry brother, I won&#39;t leave ya&quot;, stuck out to me.

pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3yR8bZ1pY&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> did they honestly leave the cheap plastic recurve sight on that bow.....
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSuperman on his planet.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitawhy everything looks so &#39;&#39;cheap&#39;&#39; here? xDDD
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe they made Klaus a cowardly bitch in this.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWait didn&#39;t Theseus slay the minotaur in the labyrint? This is just a horribly generic poorly written movie not even based on Greek Mythology or anything
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s why Superman came back to life.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWhy it’s not available on Netflix
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaCavil always gets the best roles
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaTee-day we fight for honor
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaCrap movie with kinda cool ideas, but its especially cool to see how far Cavill has come
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t find the song that is playing in this trailer
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThey need to make another movie like this one, one of the greatest god movies in my opinion
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaNEED PART 2
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaAll of you didn&#39;t heard about ancient epic events like ramayana and mahabaratha
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaToss a coin to your Witcher ! Ohh valley of plenty
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaTerrible movie; looks like all the budget went into CGI backgrounds and derivative slow-motion shots we all saw four years before this. The costume designers had to take whatever budget was left and raid JoAnn&#39;s fabric for the single bolt of gold lame they had left.  Nine years later and this is still up near the top of the list of &quot;Which Two Hours of Life I Want Back the Most.&quot; I hope this isn&#39;t in my feed in 2020 because someone is gauging interest for a sequel.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitawtf? is it Kaal El?
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita.............FUCK !
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSave martha !!!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaNever recognized this was Cavill.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSequel ...please .
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaKratos copycat
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita11-11-11
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaYet another reason to revamp the algorithm. I do watch trailers, yes... for movies that are yet to be released, not ancient relics!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitait feels like the 300
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThe most important event that happened on 11.11.11 for me as i remember was the release of Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.... Also, although i really like Henry Cavil, unfortunatelly this movie was shitting all around the Greek myhtology (as every Hollywood movie that ever happened except Armant Assante Odyssey)!! Movies like Clash Of Gods (Perseus myth), Troy (The Iliad poems), countless Hercules movies like the one with the Rock, this movie Immortals etc etc..all are nothing even close to their myths and legends that supposedly are based. And the aesthetics of the movie is nothing close to what the Greek landscape or Crete island look like...
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita3 shots four arrows. Impressive!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThat bow would be immensely useful in his monster hunting and killing..
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, but i was hoping to see more of that bow action.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaToss a coin to your Cavil! Ohh valley of plenty
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWe need a part 2 to this movie!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened to I nmortal 2? I am waiting for it...
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI dare any of you to tell me what Mickey rourke is saying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3yR8bZ1pY&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a>

pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaInmortales
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaInmortales henry cavil
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3yR8bZ1pY&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a> is anyone gonna talk about how he shoots 3 arrows and there&#39;s 4 after?!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWhy was a sequel never made to this awesome movie it’s a great watch
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWas pretty good movie
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t know Superman was in Immortals!!!!!!!!! Not Wonder Woman!!!!!!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI really dislike that actress  the Indian girl . Dunno why she just annoys me whenever I hear her speak . <br>Not a bad film though
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita=D&gt; 👌

pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI liked it, good popcorn cinema
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaTrailer&#39;s nice. When I&#39;m not distracted by those stupid, awful hats. I was actually excited to see it in theaters but it turned out to be so painful to sit through. Especially since nearly every character has some kind of ridiculous headgear. Poseidon&#39;s hat looks like someone&#39;s arts and craft project of a fish. Ares has that weird super mowhawk thing going on. And the minotaur is just a giant, shirtless dude wearing a hat that looks like a bull&#39;s head...MADE OF POISONED BARBED WIRE!! Watching the movie, you get the impression the film makers had heard of Greek mythology before, but couldn&#39;t be bothered to look it up. If you want stupid, sword and sandals fun, Clash of the Titans is a much better choice.<br>And have I mentioned how much I hate the stupid hats?

pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSome trailers are masterpieces
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this movie in 3D last night at home, it is BADASS. I always wished there was a 3D version of the 300 movie for those of us who still enjoy the 3D experiance, I believe IMMORTALS nailed it. This movie is gorgeous and has a very interesting storyline. I also had no idea the main actor was SUPERMAN until I watched it last night. I know they made a sequel to the 300 movie with a 3D version, but in my opinion it wasn&#39;t as great as the first. This movie was a lot of fun.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaArrows kill like sniper bullet .bullshit.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaOnly catholic gods need a hero we dont
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita1m10, I want to know the name of this epic music with flute 😍
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSo there not going to make a 2nd one why not this movie was way ahead of its time and gives a 300 feel to it !!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaCretan Archers are op
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita:D
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWe fight for immortalitttttyyyy!!!

pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so good
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie, really makes you think about the before us
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaI neee this movie. Now
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaCopyright infringement not near the real truth
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWhat bow hes using? Some hoyt P.O.S?
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaEven though this film was a steaming pile of shit, it&#39;s undeniable that the trailer was amazing.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaExcellent~!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitasuperman is a time traveller
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaMARTHA
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaToday marks anniversary of theatrical debut 6 years ago
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaNone of you will leave this place
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is awesome!!! Theseus was an aethiest but since he saw the gods were real, he changed his mind and battle the war of the  heavens. Couple things I didn&#39;t understand though, the gods isn&#39;t suppose to die and Theseus isn&#39;t suppose to die too. I know why there&#39;s such haters of this movie even though they haven&#39;t seen it yet because it&#39;s not bloody at all which I like. Spartacus on HBO were super bloody but great acting. This movie is not bad at all. When her sisters were inside the metal cow, I was horrified. I felt all the pain that Theseus went through.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaMickey Rourke and the trailer is the best,the rest of the movie is totall crap...this is the most stupid movie ever made...hollywood formula seems to grow up in the very bad way.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSo many haters...
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita&quot;declared war on all of humanity&quot; oh dear
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaoh another of these &quot;today we unite, honor&quot; shit movies, so cliche... what a fail movie
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita@SaladSensai which is why we all have better things to do! HAIL SKYRIM!!!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSHIT
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaLooks too cliche and like they only want to test 3d tech...
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaEverybody manages to forget Theseus was a serial rapist and womanizer, driving most of his conquests to suicide. Visually this looks awesome. I love how 0:34 replicates the great ceiling frescoes of the renaissance. Although pincerheads helmet looks balls. And the plot will probably be even worse than the remake of Clash of the Titans.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitalooks terrible
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitathat guys helmet is so gay. makes him look like a hench rabbit.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaDid they really pick the worst bits of acting for this trailer. This is so bad!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaworst trailer ever and he manages to shoot the arrows at different times but they manage to hit them all at the same time
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitathe arrow scene&#39;s from house of flying dagger..... is that an homage or a rip off? 
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita@MadameHelgasFolly u fool. watch again. plus it&#39;s a trailer
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita1:53 - guy on his knees on the left, what aweful acting and timing. LMAO 
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSo similar to 300! ... coulda changed it a bit. Although FUK IT, LOOKS SIKK!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita@MadameHelgasFolly they shortened the sequence... get over it!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaGods, this looks rubbish. Greek mythology gets raped once again. 
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaSWEET!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaWTF??
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita@bobeagle007 Clash of the Titans episode 2.  And clash of the titans suckd ballz!!!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita3 shots fired, 4 arrows fly.
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitalooks like a big mix of a lot of movies i watched in the past
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaExcelent movie 
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitayesssss, i want this!!!!
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitalol funny hats (dont think that was the point of the movie :S )
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshitaDoes not look to good to me
pE3yR8bZ1pYdelimeterByIshita1st

b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshita2023 and still love it
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshita2023 remembering this beautiful movie. I watched it when i was kid, nos i&#39;m 18.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI wish they would have continued ❤😢
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie. Still one of my favorites ❤️
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaWow. Just finish watching this movie and it was amazing! Never expected this movie was 9 yrs ago.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitafinally i remembered the movie title. i once watched this back then and completely forgot about it now. definitely gonna take a look on this again
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaWOW! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been this long since this movie came out! Here it is 2022 and I still love watching this movie! Has anyone read the books? I never have but I&#39;m seriously thinking about getting them because I heard they were great too!
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaIts 2022 and this mo ie is still at the back of my head
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaShown in:<br>Argo<br>Paranormal Activity 4<br>Fun Size <br>The Guilt Trip
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when it got release I thought it was good. I watched it again recently and I have to say it was better. Awesome movie ! They should make a part 2 or a tv series
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaJeremy Irons, Emma Thompson, Viola Davis, Eileen Atkins. All these actors are ELITE, they must have seen something in this movie to all sign on. Too bad it flopped so bad.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s 2021 already and only few people remember this movie.🥲
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitawow its crazy. 2021
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshita2021.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaToo bad there is no sequel for this movie...
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaThe books are better. The movie honestly was a disappointment. Hopefully Netflix can make a good series out of it and follow the books.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaThis concept has been beaten to death. And then used as fluff in a toy horse. To be beat again.<br>Confused teenager, good or bad, will change the faith of everything. Stop me if you know this story...
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaLenaaaaa ... ilove that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2IVUIZX-Ws&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a>
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaHOW     DID    THIS   GET    MADE
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI’m here for the witches
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaNot a bad movie 😚
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshita♡♡♡-!!!
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitafucking love the movie i want see lena met ethan in the end!
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitagood
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI kinda liked this movie
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaCompletely different from the book, but not a bad movie.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI am acc so diss appointed. I imagined eathan much handsomer! 
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaSeven Devils 
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaTwilight sucks balls... vampire balls
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaomg amazing where i live its coming out on the 13th 
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually considering see this movie, the trailer got my vote.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be watching this on the 14th :)
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaWell I love Harris I think she is a very good writer with a great humour about her books and I also enjoy LJ Smiths work too and I much prefer True Blood and VDiaries over Twilight. But sure the writing and production of Twilight is fairly low/average but regardless I enjoy it as a movie franchise and the books are an entertaining read at the least. Plus I thank it as I am not sure TB/VDiaries would have got shows if not for the success of the Twilight series.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaand actually vampire diaries and true blood are great, unlike twilight, which is shit, written for 14 year old pubescent girls by a woman whose writing style is on that level.
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaI am a huge Twilight fan, but Twilight is not really that original. Yes it brought vampires back to the mainstream media in the same way Anne Rice did and even though shows like Vampire Diaries and True Blood aired after the first Twilight movie it doesn&#39;t change that Twilight borrowed heavily from both the Vampire Diaries and theSouthern Vampire Mysteries series of books as well as things like Interview With the Vampire and the Vampire Lestat.

Also its nat a Vamp movie, just similar style. 
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaits overexagerated from the book
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaYeahhhh..
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaInteresting... i like it... :3
b2IVUIZX-WsdelimeterByIshitaХУЙНЯ
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitathomas shelby lookin real young haha
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaworth watching
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaIcarus was probably not the most auspicious name they could have chosen.
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaA visually stunning film.
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaI freaking hate how not only do they have to make every female actress moan every word seductively, but now they made the automated computer have a female voice that also moans every word seductively. Why don&#39;t they do the same with male actors??  Why can&#39;t they just have females talk in a normal voice like males do??
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaI never thought I would see captain America, bloodsport, and scarecrow collaborating to save the sun.
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else feel like this is a super bad trailer?
h9CgwOifQzodelimeterByIshitafive minute trailer, give me a break

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita0.40 ha Colin Farrel looks like a completely different person almost, he&#39;s actually a pretty good actor overall. 
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaLOL this film is jokes
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaagree with aniston keeping her hair like thattt
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitacan some1 tell me the list of the songs that are being played in this clip
??
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaJennifer should definitely keep her hair like that.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaonly reason im going to see this is because it has charlie day in it and it doesn&#39;t look half bad
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita@gingerofthesketch well Charlie day cant cause hes screwed cause his fiance will see those pics his boss has and the other 2 are kinda high up the chain, quitting and starting over would be a bitch

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitawait, here&#39;s a thought. Why don&#39;t they just quit?
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita&quot;Rollin&#39; around all day in his SPECIAL, LITTLE, SECRET CHAIR!&quot; Fucking awesome looking role for Colin Farrell, he reminds me a little of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder only nowhere near as extreme haha.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think anyone here is going to die, so I&#39;m gonna pass.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitai have never been so attracted to jennifer aniston.... 1:17 .... soooo hot even with the creepy dude behind her.... no homo
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitadefinately will watch this
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitameh.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita&quot;the trim the fat &quot; guy was awesome
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, was that Ron White?
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitahahha that looks nice!
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita@OneGaurdian 
It&#39;s possible. The film could be going for dark comedy
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Aniston always a plays a kind of uptight or frantic busy woman so it’s nice to see her being a fucking sexy succubus in this. And she looks good as a brunette. God damn.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good and original enough to watch :)
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaGonna watch this, like a boss
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita@matenzo 
Yeah its nice to see her branch out. She proved with The Good Girl that she&#39;s capable of playing more than just Rachel from Friends. I hope this movie is good
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitajeniffer aniston finally not being jeniffer aniston
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita1 boss dislike this

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaim gonna watch this for Ron white...and maybe jen too
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitai heard this movie looked good and damn they weren&#39;t lying! 
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaThis is the first trailer for a movie in a long time that I want to watch.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaThe first trailers in months/years that made me giggle a little.

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita@JustinDombrowski And you&#39;re not gonna get any thumbs up for that one.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitacolin ferrell&#39;s part is right on tom cruise&#39;s part in tropic thunder... im not mad, but it wasn&#39;t original for the makers of this movie&#39;s behalf.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaTATER SALAD!!! 2:22
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaWow Jennifer Aniston looked hot there.


VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaBUNK!!!!! And MICHAEL BLUTH!!!!

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshita@MisterSeaCucumber this single handedly made my decision on seeing this movie
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaOMG I WANNA WATCH IT NOW!
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaLMFAOO! &quot;i dont win alot&quot; 

Colin farrell looks hilarious in this too. 
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome, and they made Jennifer look fine as hell in this!
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaAs long as they don&#39;t actually murder their bosses, I&#39;ll be fine with this movie.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitagreat trio!
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaI need Jamie Foxx to get bigger roles these days...
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t Stop? Red Hot Chili Peppers? Holy shit!
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitai love how trim the fat means fire the fat people in this context. lololol
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt is a moron for leaving Aniston
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaCHARLIE DAY Is going to steal the show!!!! 1:33 - 1:41 is so charlie kelly.
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaI just noticed Ron White at the end there..

VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaHi I want to be in movies
VpUeQV8sdOcdelimeterByIshitaCan i be here favourite?
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitagolden army.....where did I hear this again?..
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never seen these movies, but got to ask: why does he have like 2 lines in a 2 minute trailer? I get no sense of the character from these trailers. He might as well have a high pitch voice and a Swedish accent and I wouldn&#39;t know before seeing the movie.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitahellboy 2019
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaCame here to bleach my eyes after the 2019 trailer
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThis movie wasn&#39;t that good
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaYou have no idea how many times ive watched this movie. At one point i memorized their lines...
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThis movie was trash compared to Del Toro&#39;s first
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe new trailer isn´t even close to this one...
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe new trailer isn´t even close to this one...
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaLooks the same style with the cgi from Pan&#39;s labyrinth
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaDavid Haourbir as HELLBOY!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI love how this trailer is basically a bunch of one liners.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaIn this video:<br>- Del Toro looking young<br>- Yahoo looking old
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaBack when Yahoo was the main source for new official trailers :)
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe villain reminds me of Neji Hyuga and Hinata Hyuga... I’ve watched hell boy 1,2 long... ago
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWhose here after seeing the 2023 Hellboy sequel trailer?
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI guess everyone came here after watching Hellboy 2019
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s wired to watch this and compare it to the new 2019 hellboy when this hellboy movie form almost 9 years ago looks better.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaim here to feel better about after that TERRIBLE Hellboy 2019 trailer
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitadude I remember being 8 years old and I watched this movie religiously
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaMaine Hertz brined perfect suits for this movie
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaNow that&#39;s how you do a Hellboy fucken trailer.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaRon Perlman forever.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaCame back here to rewash my eyes after the 3r trailer, and thought I am watching the real 3rd trailer.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWar......war never changes
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMWQEi8vvto&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a> he made a doom demon sound. Nice
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaMEIN HERZ BRENNT I love this song
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe new Hellboy movie cant not even Match with this one…….
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaYahoo?? The Heck!!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaBetter than new hellboy
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe new hellboy is the same tone as this movie lol
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWho came back here after watching the Hellboy(2019) trailer and realized the new one doesn&#39;t look that bad.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWow. They really just skimmed the whole movie into the trailer huh. Glad I watched it after cause damn
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaJesus Christ Now I have to see I a lot of idiots commenting who came hear after <b>Hellboy</b> 2019 trailer
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaNew Hellboy sucks...
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI miss Ron Pearlman and Del Toro after watching the new hellboy trailer.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaMuch better than the new one
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI miss Guilmerros visual imagery
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaBetter than new hellboy trailor
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe mood of these trailers to the reboot is sad, they completely changed the feel of DelToro&#39;s HellBoy. Instead of an Action Adventure it feels like an Action Comedy like DeadPool.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaRIP hellboy theme,<br>RIP hellboy amazing custume &amp; characters,<br>RIP hellboy badass/cool antihero,<br>RIP hellboy practical e&quot;,<br>&amp; RIP hellboy !<br><br>Waiting years and years for the new movie series to become more accurate R rated and with some more good plots.<br><br>and now It looks like the same every Marvel movie for kids ever.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWho else came back here in 2018/2019 to watch this trailer after the Hellboy Reboot trailer was released? <br><br>Needed to wash that sad experience out of my mind...
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaAnyone else here after watching  The 2019 trailer? Man, I wish they woulda just continued this storyline honestly
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitainb4 came here after watching the new hb trailer
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaHere to cure the cancer from the new Hellboy trailers.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI had to come here just to confirm the new Hellboy trailer is garbage.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaNew Hellboy: Better FX, better design, slightly more cheese, with David &quot;It&#39;s a Tide Ad&quot; Harbour...<br>Old Hellboy: Classic action films, cheese is only a topping on a glorious cake, Ron Perlman is a god.<br><br>Hmm... Not sure which is better yet.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWho else is watching this after watching the new Hellboy trailer?
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaAlguien del 2018? Solo  vine a oír mein herz brennt en el trailer
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshita10 Years past and still no HellBoy3
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitagolden army is the best super hero films still, i don&#39;t want its rebooted,all i need is just the hellboy 3
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe movie turns 10 today!<br>Still better than the first <br>Wish they didn’t reboot it
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe best movies are made in 2008
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaWe get fuckin transformer movies but we cant get a hellboy3
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaIn hellboy 3 there are gonna be three hellboys
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThere is no Rammstein in the film....DISAPOINTED
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaLoved this movie as a kid came back to see the trailer its a classic

HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaRammstein!!!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitathis movie was, not good.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThe costume design in Guillermo del toros films is just superb 😃
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitai watched this as a 11/12 year old at the movies with my grandpa and older brother and younger male cousin. i thought the whitehaired guy was kinda hot lol
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaHellboy 2 and Batman Begins are my 2 favorite comic book movies of all time! both masterpieces !
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaProbably the greatest comic book movie ever made! Along side with The Crow , Watchmen , The Dark Knight and Spider Man 1.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaArguably the best comic book movie ever made!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMWQEi8vvto&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a><br><br>chick: &quot;Don&#39;t call me babe&quot;<br>Hellboy: &quot;Abe, I said Abe!&quot;
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI love how in the description: &quot;...starring Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, Doug Jones, Doug Jones, John Alexander.&quot;<br><br>Three actors have the same name.
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaI wonder why at year 2012 that they never made a part 3 , sense Hellboy 1 was made in year 2004 right ? . Like it takes 4 years to put a movie together &amp; put in the movies cinema&#39;s ? .
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaThat was stupid Hellboys  girlfriend ppl. may call her melted the king crown that ruled the Golden Army , Christians may say , &amp; those who are open minded , &amp; to those who knows there will always be s/o country going to be invaded one day or another many times that are good kings kingdoms that are on earth . For Nothing is new under the sun thing it says in the bible , &amp; ppl. will hear wars of wars , says in the bible . She just she thinks she will live forever and able to save the world forever . Not case , naive ,  &amp; says don&#39;t give your power to women who makes kings fall says in the bible . Now her country will fall , or the countries that are good on earth to help take their own country evil Goverment , &amp;   others who work with them ,evil Gorvernments working together , &amp; good Governments working with good Dovernments if any exist at these times ,  if was a true story this movie , if that is how that country in the movie is in sheep clothing . KJV Bible -Ecclesiastes 1:9-11 , KJV Bible Matthew 24:6-13 , 1 Corinthians <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMWQEi8vvto&amp;t=14m32s">14:32</a>-36 , 1 Corinthians 11:8 - 10 , 1 Corinthians 11:3 , KJV Bible Proverbs 31:3  , KJV Bible Proverbs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMWQEi8vvto&amp;t=15m23s">15:23</a> , KJV Bible Proverbs - 25:9 .KJV Bible 1 Timothy 6:3-5 , KJV Bible 1 Timothy 4:7 . And Movie Hellboy one sucked . The only thing that was worth watching was how he was found ( Hellboy ) , &amp; when his girlfriend burned the room up to kill monster babies in a pile that may had bodies like Gorillas &amp; head as a body of squid like , down those lines . Hellboy 2 was way better but what I&#39;ve mentioned above in this message , &amp; the girlfriend or whatever being difficult , sneaky , showing signs not to trust her with a man bec. she was wanting to hang with a a man at the bench out of the company building &amp; asking Hellboy why are they together or something down those lines . The woman isn&#39;t showing any signs of like the man from the beginning when they ask that question &amp; just wants a way out .
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMWQEi8vvto&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> Abe, I said. Abe! xD that part gets me every time
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaOn of my favorite movies!
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitarammstein lml
HMWQEi8vvtodelimeterByIshitaRon Perlman was offered the role of Piccolo in Dragonball: Evolution , but turned it down to work on Hellboy II: The Golden Army....OMG - THANK YOU RON PERLMAN...

iLW1vpPESQkdelimeterByIshita🔥🔥🔥🔥 <br> Love this movie. <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLW1vpPESQk&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> 💝🎥🎬 <br>  👇👇👇💘
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie and soundtrack. I know it&#39;s not good to glamorize crime, but if Jesse James looked like that. Hell...
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaHello all introduce my name is Hastin Nuraini Jalan Lilin Mas 6 Dadaprejo Junrejo Batu East Java - Indonesia Tel: 62-81334887683 I love to write and have a series of short stories I want to sell a movie script for Hollywood And one day want to be a jury at the film festival greetings from Indonesia
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe essence of this film, theres one scene where Pitts character ask Do you wanna be like me or you wanna be me and it&#39;s absolutely chilling. And it has a  excellent ending with full resolution to a great story, to a story you invest nearly two hours in so huge thumbs up
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis film is brilliant!!!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitai hope i havent watch this movie, but sadly i&#39;ve watched:(
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer suck. But the movie is highly underrated to me. I so happen to stumble across it by flipping through channels
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaRed dead redemption 2 brought me here
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaRed Dead Redemption II brought me here. The game is inspired by this movie.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaWithout a doubt one of the best shot films I&#39;ve ever seen. I watched it last night and I&#39;m watching it again now.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert: Robert Ford kills Jesse James
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitathis had the potential to be a great movie. ...too bad it wasn&#39;t
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaJesse James was a coward NOT a hero. He figuratively shot society in the back again and again. While you can justifiably call Robert Ford a coward too, I&#39;m glad Jesse James life ended that way. It was justice.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaone of the best movies i ever saw
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe reason, I believe, why this film is so underrated (especially by audiences) is the fact that, much like Kubrick&#39;s &quot;Barry Lyndon,&quot; it leans toward a more meditative style, reflecting and analyzing the psyche of its two lead characters rather than engaging in the typical gratuitous standoff/shootout sequences with rapid-fire editing, while also presenting its characters not as mythical figures (a common cliché of the Western genre), but as simple, ordinary, flawed men who are not actually tough but just happen to be prone to violence and greed. Also, it&#39;s quite more leisurely paced than &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (an equally great picture) and less action-centered than &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwAWZtK5Uw&amp;t=3m10s">3:10</a> to Yuma&quot; (a considerably inferior picture). In a nutshell, it&#39;s a masterpiece.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaHopefully he paved the way for his whole entire family ..bcuz they deserve it
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaif thats the true story jesse james ws the fukn man b
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitabob was a stalker!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitathe perfect movie
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitawow casey affleck looks so young! awesome movie
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitasomeone please help with the soundtrack name????!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece but the last 30 minutes shows what this movie is REALLY about. Celebrity worship and wanting to be a celebrity.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaSuch an amazing movie with great acting.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is super gay i can tell
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI see all the good reception of this movie ! I will watch it right now ... i&#39;ll be comenting later with my own feedback !
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite films of all time. Watched in cinema 10 years ago and bought the dvd later. Pitt acts good but Afflecks acting is the most remarkable here.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaa really great movie
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI heard there was a 4.5 hour version of this film, too bad they never released it..... :,(
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe whole lesson of the film&#39;s plot became a legendary phrase: &#39;Just cuz you killed Jesse James, doesn&#39;t make you Jesse James&#39;.<br> Take heed, China_you will never be America.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe whole lesson of the film&#39;s plot became a legendary phrase: &#39;Just cuz you killed Jesse James, doesn&#39;t make you Jesse James&#39;. Take heed, China_you will never be America.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaone of the greatest films in my opinion, Affleck, Pitt, Rockwell and the voice over unbelievable. the panoramic scenes unbelievable. true work of art folks
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaRoger Deakins is the master of his craft
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaMy heart pounded for a good majority of this film, just amazing.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaone of the best movies ive seen ,,,
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI cannot believe the music for this movie wasnt nominated...
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe film is a masterpiece and I&#39;m trying to think if I&#39;ve seen a better trailer...
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaWithout that mildly overwritten title, I would have thought this was a mild bromance movie.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaGod I feel lucky I haven&#39;t watched this yet because if I did I would want to erase it from my mind and rewatch it again
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer has better direction, cinematography and acting than most movies.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaidk how this has slipped under my radar, gonna watch this now
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaWhat an amazing film. Very sad that is so underrated. With Casey, Brad also should have been nominated for the Oscar!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaBest movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe score to this film is haunting and beautiful, such a underrated and amazing film.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert Jesse die ....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>....and Robert
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a sad movie and it made me cry
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaWorst movie ever. After 20 minutes I thought I&#39;d been watching it for two hours.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaIt seems unimportant, but this movie has the coolest title in a long time. Every movie now is just one word or it&#39;s got a subtitle with &quot;rise of&quot; or &quot;revenge of&quot; in it. I miss awesome movie titles like &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Ugly&quot;.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitt&#39;s best performance? Also Casey Affleck&#39;s acting is amazing. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;d say an Affleck has talent, but hell...
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaForget &quot;Seven&quot;, forget &quot;Fight Club&quot;, forget &quot;Moneyball&quot;..<br>Brad Pitt gives the performance of his fucken career in this movie!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie &amp; like most great movies it never seems to be on hbo, showtime or the half dozen other movie channels
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitarip brangelina
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe Assassination of Jesse James by spoiler alert the coward Robert ford wold be a better title.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaIs this a good movie?
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaany violence?
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why this film wasn&#39;t nominated alongside There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men for Best Picture, it&#39;s so well-directed, acted, authentically written, beautifully shot. Why did it not get those oscar noms!!?
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movies with a great narrator (Hugh Ross)
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitalove to watch it but I maybe not gonna watch it because I keep skip part Jeremy Renner only..n
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaA masterpiece.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshita@MetalGearFan2012That&#39;s TRUE! I HAVE TO SAY IT - I was a big (let&#39;s call it &quot;fan&quot; - and a researcher on Jesse James&#39; story) - but THIS MOVIE (although I wouldn&#39;t agree on SOME things they said about Him) - THIS MOVIE (I HAVE TO SAY IT) - is a Goddamn MASTERPIECE! ...a VERY SAD masteriece, though - nevertheless a GREAT MOVIE! PS. ...and ALSO would like to add that there is probably ON-ONE ELSE in THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, that could play Jesse James better (in THIS movie) - than Brad Pitt did! Gotta also give a HUGE CREDIT to the guy playing ROB FORD! EXCELLENT ACTORS and STUNNING PERFORMANCES! ...
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitamy great grad parents  was a train robber
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitai am not here too unite scandinavia
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie gives me fucking chills
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaif jesse james shot ppl in the back like robert ford shot jesse james then doesn&#39;t that make jesse james as cowardice as robert ford ? from the movie portrayal isn&#39;t robert ford right to shoot jesse in the back . we all regard our own lives as equal bringing the meaning dog eat dog world to rights . kill or be killed  does that really make you a coward.  There&#39;s a debate there.  I think the title by the coward robert ford is unfair  given the anger and the physiological mind of Robert ford at the time of shooting jesse . watch the movie put yourself in Roberts shoes and then think would you shoot  . if your human of sound mind   yes you would  xx
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most underrated movie ever made period.  It is downright baffling how no one ever talks about it and it was not at all successful,  It has an amazing A-list cast, masterful directing,cinematography, musical score, and of course performances.  I guess its just a prime example of being ahead of its time and poor marketing,  especially since just this last year saw a huge trend in gritty auteur westerns(hateful 8, revenant, bone tomahawk)  I have been obsessed with with film since it came out and am glad its recently starting to gain a well deserved cult following.  <br><br>Related side note:  How the hell is Casey Affleck not a huge movie star???!!!!??
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaBobby had such a hard on for Jesse.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaNick Cave did a great job on this soundtrack and he was actually in a scene in the movie. He was the guitar player in the bar near the end of the movie.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis is not one of the most underrated movies of all times. This is the most underrated movie of all times.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m related to Jesse James
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest movies ever made.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaWatchMojo brought me here :)
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the greatest trailer ever.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaSuch a beautiful film. Seriously underrated.  Performances are phenomenal and the cinematography is beyond perfect.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best films of 2007.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaeverything is virtually perfect. Except the pace of time, a bit too slow ..a bit too often.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe title is too long O_o
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe best crime-drama movie I&#39;ve ever watched
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitai watched this movie its Briliant<br>i recommended<br>sorry for my English
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaHow did I miss this movie?
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaالله اكبر
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaAlthough his performance is magnificent, they really make Casey Affleck out to be the main Star
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaI really wanted this film to win Best cinematography that year. I was really bummed when it didn&#39;t.  not a huge fan of Pitt, but I think he did a great job in this film.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaDeserves to be right there with No Country and There Will Be Blood
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaMr Smith vs Batman&#39;s younger brother ;)
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitadefinitely the best movie of brad pitt. Maybe the first film of him with acting a stern man...Notice his meaningful eyeshot which frightenes everybody around him...And also impressive performance when it comes to tone of words. Be careful when he said you know what ?. ...Incredible
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitais this film worth watching guys? tell me your opinions so I can decide
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitathere&#39;s spoilers in the title!!!!!!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaoh god how much  i love this film, how much<br>if i was there i would kill that fucking coward with my own hands
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitathis music was in water for elephants trailer
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard, and laid poor Jesse in his grave -
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaSoundtrack to my life
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitacasey affleck always looks so annoying
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaplease tell movies like this. &lt;3
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaBrad Pitts effortless performance in rare form. Casey Affleck at his best.(Oscars best supporting actor nomination) Great supporting cast. Pitt own&#39;s it!  Classic period piece Western.﻿
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaIt is funny how Hollywood makes Jessie James such a hero to the people. He was in fact a murderer. It is well documented how he and his outlaws killed innocent bystanders ,one of which was a 17 year old boy. Jessie himself shot  a bank teller in the back of the head just because the man was a former Union Officer. Then he shot a clerk in the back as he ran out of the bank. Yeah Jessie was a real brave guy.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThe best western that no one knows about
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaThis film is criminally underrated. <br><br>Everything about it is hauntingly beautiful: the cinematography, music and acting - especially Pitt&#39;s detached and desperate loneliness. <br><br>It will be looked upon as a classic as time passes.
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie that touches you from inside 
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaMesmerizing!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaevery frame is goddamn painting! beautiful!
6RwAWZtK5UwdelimeterByIshitaone of the most beautifully shot films...
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaWhere
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaBad movie .<br>Bad director .<br>Not good 4 watching .
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaI was 10 when this came out time flies
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaWhat I find so funny is that when I was a kid and ummm discovering myself ahem 👀 I would legit just watch it for Scar Jo. Now 18 as an adult I realize it’s one of the most relatable films for dudes and it’s overall just a really intelligent movie. I still can’t get over this was Levit Gordon’s screenwriting and directorial debut.
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaJust imagine the big picture ! the man prefer porn than Mrs Johannson, Jeeeeez 🙈
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaNot a single scene of Julianne Moore , she&#39;s one of the main characters in the movie 😏
zAE6YFikffsdelimeterByIshitaThis was a damn masterpiece only regret it wasnt longer.. wish this guy made more movies his ideas are amazing.

nu6R7ypaz5gdelimeterByIshitahuh
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see a movie on Ruth, she id a great character too
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most underrated movies
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie made me grieve for those parents in real life who lost their children and never got closer. Not knowing what happened to their children. I was traumatized when I watched this movie and it stayed with me until this day.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI can’t wait for it to come out!
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThe book is more <i>detailed</i> ,if you know what i  mean
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI already  watch it when I was a kid but I always wondered if its inspired by the true story
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI just watched the whole movie with this trailer. Jesus
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis was my favorite movie ever I cried so much what horrible people and what can do to anybody
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI hate that he gets what’s coming later in his life, it should’ve been sooner and the safe was never found from I remember unless I’m wrong
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaKinda boring twist.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie tells you to NOT go into a guys cubby  that in the ground
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaHere’s a funny(ish) story about this film. My mom saw this film, and read the book, and for months afterwards, she wouldn’t let me or my sister walk home. She made sure to come pick us up everyday, despite the fact that it was only a two minute drive. I think that speaks volumes about how effective this film is at traumatising you, and that’s a good thing
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaYouTube U telling me I’m gonna be murdered after meeting a hot guy???
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaGot damn this movie was terrible
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9PrQmcV81Y&amp;t=0m43s">0:43</a> .......Christopher? Is that you?
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMy birthday was December 6, 1997 maybe thats also why this movie hit me so hardon a personal level. Because what if it happened to me. I wonder what ide be like in suzy&#39;s case
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMy beloved childhood 😍
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitawhy do they want to cheapen this movie so hard lmao
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMs. Ronan&#39;s whispery narration :-)
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this movie about 10 years ago now. its so sad that her body didn&#39;t find anymore! 😢 😢 😢
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaWhy tf put everything in the trailer
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaYou have to watch these creepy mf around your kids let’s be honest 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaWhat, this movie came out like ten years ago? Thought it&#39;s new judging from the thumbnail.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI loved this book
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie killed me
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitacan any body tell the whole story plz?
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaWhen I look at this trailer I only think of OmG iTs MaRy QuEeN oF sCoTs
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaHappy 10 year anniversary
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI have never cried while watching a movie in my entire life. I watched this movie in 2011 when my son was a few months old. God! I couldn&#39;t stop my tears. That girl looked like an angel. I felt a deep connection as I was a new mother at that time. This movie still bring tears to my eyes.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI read the book before watching the movie. The book is so descriptive it gives you chills.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitathis movie made me cry every time i watched it😭
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThe movie&#39;s only a fraction as good as the book.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI hated this movie cuz it was an easy way out for the killer. Am not sure if you can even call it justice.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaEvery time I see Stanley Tucci in other movie  I cant help myself from hating him for murdering Susie.. Like legit.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaWatch this movie when I was to young , I am 21 years old , I still feel the sadness I felt when I was younger. Good actors and good movie tho but it’s so so sad.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI cried for 2 HOURS straight
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when i was a kid and i didn&#39;t know it was Soarise  Ronan. I thought she looked familiar.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaUghhhh!! This movie is so sad😭
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful trauma for me.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThe book is even more f up but it&#39;s a really good read 🤓.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when i was 10 now iam 18
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie impacted my childhood 😭😭😭😭😭😭
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI just heard of this movie and saw the trailer of it and it is so upsetting to me that Suzie (at just 14 years old) was murdered
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaDid this movie win any awards?
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitavery good movie.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaCan somebody recommand me movies that are kinda like this one??
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaGod this movie haunts me to this day
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is absolutely heartbreaking.  The rapist guy is super sweet in real life and didnt even feel comfortable playing that part but i would definitely have to punch him in the face if i came face to face with him.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI don’t love her every movie but Saoirse ronin is so talented, one of my favorite actresses
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaNever talk or trust to strangers and neighborhood
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie made me sad
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is just too depressing. I am sorry I ever saw it.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer frankly ruins the film; it&#39;s poorly cut and makes the film look very pretentious and sappy.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI wish I had seen a preview before watching the movie, lol. I had no clue she died, and I cried so much through the whole thing.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMovie was stupid 🤮
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaher sister was so brave ❤
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaSad subject.<br>Beautifully written.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI remember the first time I watched this was last year I was sitting on my couch scrolling through Netflix and I BALLED my eyes out I couldn’t stop crying .
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshita&quot;You are beautiful Suzie Salmon&quot;<br>Me: Aaaawwweee. This looks like a cute love story. 😍🥰<br>&quot;I was 14 years old when I was murdered&quot;<br>Me: 😧😲😮😦
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThe movie portrayed life lessons: (1)Evil people will not get caught by police but nature will get rid of them. (2) Don&#39;t be so naive or you will go to grave. (3) Be careful with way- too- nice people who has a vault.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaHow the hell did I miss this movie in 2009 is beyond me then again it was release in December so you know competition is intense
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was maybe a sequel to this beautiful classic.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will harsh your buzz
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitai watched this with my friend and her mother as a kid, the memory of it feels like a wound, i remember feeling so wrecked watching it because i’m a girl myself, the sorrow of knowing that so many girls the age i was at the time have been taken away from their entire lives because of some twisted person, and the notion of them even being haunted by them in the after life, AND the fact that sometimes justice is not immediately or even ever served broke my heart like nothing else. this film is absolutely beautiful and painful, hearing alice by cocteau twins still makes my heart fill up and my eyes get watery.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie traumatised me as a kid and I couldn’t sleep properly for months
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaKarma is a biatch!
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaOooh.. i love this movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitathe song was the only reason  was interested in this movie. I finally saw it after years of being curious and thought it was, unfortunately, incredibly boring...
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaHow many times...I cried at this Movie?<br>And how many times i will do it again?<br>It is so beautiful and Sad. ❤
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI still don’t understand youtube recommendations
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies during my early teens, the first time I tried to watch it I couldn’t, so intense! Later I did and became a favorite!
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI cried a lot during this movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaWho watches the trailers but never actually watches the movies
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie shook me as a middle schooler it’s so sad and heartbreaking
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaBeautifully sad movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaLiv moore wow
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitai have special attachment with this movie💛
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI watched it. One of the best movie I’ve watched.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve read this book
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaBeautifull movie!!
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie a few years ago... It&#39;s amazing
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaAnd I’m about to watch little women
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie so much. I remember hoping that she was actually still alive somewhere and was Soo heartbroken that she wasn&#39;t
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaIf you can help me, I don&#39;t understand the end... The body will never be found?<br>This actress definitely looks like an Angel...
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI watched this in theatres with a friend, and I STILL grapple with the injustice that her crush and friend &amp; sister were SO CLOSE to finding her bones but were seconds too late....the only justice was that man died so he couldn&#39;t hurt any more girls
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMe encanta esta película y nos da una lección muy importante cuando Susie dise que ella creía que su vida era perfecta y que estaba tan ocupada pensando en su primer amor el chico de sus sueños que nunca puso atención en su alrededor y no se dio cuenta que este hombre la estaba acechando y es verdad a veces estamos tan ocupados con tantas cosas incluso los niños hoy día se la pasas sumidos en el teléfono que no vemos alrededor de nosotros y alguien nos puede estar siguiendo y no nos damos cuentas aprendamos de Susie y miremos a nuestro alrededor cuando caminamos y estamos en la calle quizá así podremos prevenir una tragedia
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was so sad , this movie touch my heart and I was crying the entire movie , because how somebody can kill a sweet girl like Susie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaThis was a great movie adaptation . I loved it so much. It&#39;s been over 10 years now.. I think I need to watch it again :p lol
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite movie ever😢
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaSaw this when i was a kid, and boiii my eyes kept sweating
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaomg I finally find it 😭😭😭
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaVery nice en emotional movie good vfx CGI technice
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this one and The Uninvited back-to-back on HBO when I was alone in my home during 8th grade summer vacation. I still remember how scared I was after that. I kept thinking that all the ghosts try to communicate with people and some ghosts (or in-between people) are violent.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaIt’s hard to believe that this movie came out 10 years ago now. Which is crazy.
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaIntriguing
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI have never seen this movie, is it good?
s9PrQmcV81YdelimeterByIshitaI hate how much I cried during this movie
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshita❤ childhood favorite 👌
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaAté hoje tenho a esperança,de abrir o canal da Paramount e ver um trailer de um novo filme do sexta-feira 13
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaScream on top
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaMy movie..
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaThis film was panned by critics upon it&#39;s initial release and although the original trailer was very effective, this one is far more superior than the original trailer and if this trailer was the original one the film would&#39;ve been even more successful..just my opinion..lol. Love this film more than any new horror flick out there today!
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaThat is Jason Voorhees
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaFriday the 13th is an unlucky day to happen. In 2023 it happens in October. 😄

sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshita&quot;The greatest horror trailer doesn&#39;t exist-&quot;<br>The greatest horror trailer:
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaSo Jason is basically a demon who kills vampire actors
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaMy boy!!!
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaPlease make more friday the 13th  movie
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaI think this is a really bad movie, it isn&#39;t written very well and the final twist was boring and hard to understand. I give this movie 4/10
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaIf Jason Voorhees lose his hands, arms, legs or head. He won&#39;t able to kill. Fire, Bombs, sword would work.
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaSo the vengeful ghost of the boy incarnates as a serial killer? I&#39;m watching this for the first time rn.

sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaWhy was Annie not picked up at the township when she arrived? She was expected by the camp director and the others so surely a pick up could have been arranged
sAzkW7HFh5UdelimeterByIshitaBarry is killed then Claudette.  As the killer approached Claudette to kill her you see a car/truck tire in front of her.  Claudette could have picked up the tire and thrown it at her killer??

tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaSo will Idris Elba find himself in Game Of Thrones now?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThe North remembers.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s hope that Richard Madden doesn&#39;t die again.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaTHE KING OF THE NORTH... is dead.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaBUT IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThis proves he&#39;ll be a good james bond
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitatrue detective season 2 woman dont know her name
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaA bomb in Paris? Bad timing
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaJames Bond!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitai love Idris Elba, but never take away that accent of his. its part of him.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitabanality
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitawatching this trailer.. all i think of my name is bond james Idris bond
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitareally questioning why all the british actors are doing an american accent, seems to take place in paris too so americas there make even less sense. <br>Sadly i think this is a not gonna do well, for reasons beyond the accents :(<br>i love both these actors too, so it&#39;s a real shame
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaLove Idris so will defo watch this.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaGeewaaan Idris
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIrdis alba shud b the next bond!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaJames Born is coming
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba for the new Bond!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaDAMN THIS IS AWESOME
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaJust give him James Bond Role already
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaOkay, I need this in my life.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitahe will be the next 007 .
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThe north remembers
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaStringer, where&#39;s Wallace??
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaHope this isn&#39;t Americas version of Luther?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaALLAHUAKBAR!!!!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaOnly reason i might see this is because Idris is in it.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaFor someone who can pickpocket that good, this looks like a good movie.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThey need Clancy the cat!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaah yes that awkward moment in the elevator with music playing, classic XD
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitasiban a seguir saliendo en otro ydioma meboy de este canal
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba has a lot of SWAG
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaAnyone who says Idris would not be a fantastic James Bond after seeing this is even more in denial than before....
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaShit accents.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaRun Robb Stark, run! Winter is coming and that black guy is probably a Bolton or a Frey!! D:
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaMeh,  seems like a by the numbers action betrayal film.  Bluray buy
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaTHIS + the Wire + award winning show LUTHER just further prove that Idris Elba has neither the looks, the acting chops, or the action prowess to be a believable James Bond.  Wait...what?  C&#39;mon Hollywood...
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaFILM COMPLETE t here  in the = &gt; <a href="http://bit.ly/1QBlWJ2">http://bit.ly/1QBlWJ2</a>
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaidris.... yes.... count me in... he would be a great bond!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaRichard&#39;s eye looks innocent
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaTerrorism in Paris.... Almost seems too soon
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitalooks like a fun ride :)
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitathis whole movie is probably Idris Elba&#39;s audition tape to play 007
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaHey it&#39;s the king of the north.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaкруто че
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaI wonder would he get a Oscar award 4 this
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaUmm...wow could this movie be any more akward considering recent events? I mean i know it was in production before but.....yikes.....
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaRichard Madden reminds of Sebastian Stan...am I the only one that thinks that?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaFocus meets safe house
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s see: bad music, check. confusing/absent plot, check. mediocre action, check. cliché elevator scene, check. Looks pretty naff :\
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaBond audition.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaJust make the guy James Bond already.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaTwo are British one is Scottish all playing Americans lol
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaI wish they make a movie on actual Bastille day, historically accurate
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaSerious version of Focus. Good
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaBOND!!!!!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitawhat is song they use?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaTHE KING IN THE NORTH ....Now is just a thief....!!! baahhhhhhh

tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba kicking ass for almost two hours. Sign me up
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitarobe you failed the starks
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaHe needs to be bond
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaNon-comic version of Batman and Robin
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitamore excited with the movie soundtrack than the movie&#39;s storyline
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThink they found a new member of &quot;now you see me&quot; ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaShould&#39;ve stick with his real british accent that would be Badass
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaToo many fake Heros....we need real Heros ....
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaAwesome
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaVoiture automatique à Paris ? Mouais... J&#39;adore Idris &quot;Canceler of the Apocalypse&quot; Elba mais la bande annonce ressemble à du Besson, en vachement moins bien.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitarobb stark vs luther
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaVery cool.. I just hope they&#39;re all playing French roles and didn&#39;t feel the need to fake a French accent.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThe 007 we all want!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitahe&#39;s habdsome 😊
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaWould have been so much better if they hadn&#39;t made Idris do an american accent.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaCome back Rob Stark.. Come back
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaGive me likes for no reason
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaThe north remembers.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaLUTHER: THE MOVIE!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaHow did they not cast idris elba for james bond... Ffs
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaand why can&#39;t Idris Elba play James Bond again?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba makes every movie better....the guy is just too badass
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaRobb Stark lives!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIf this movie doesn&#39;t prove that he should be the next 007 then I don&#39;t know what will.
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitablack version of Dwayne johnson
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris&#39; 007 tryouts
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba you molested agu wtf
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitarob stark he&#39;s back
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitashame...
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaSo is this practice for Bond, or nah?
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaHe would be awesome as James Bond
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaInstead of Idris Elba must be Jean Reno!
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaWow
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaIdris Elba is awesome, but why would they make him do an American accent, it&#39;s not good
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaNo matter what role he plays in any movie, Idris Elba will always be John Luther
tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshitaFIRST BOIS

tO7fJBipjT8delimeterByIshita😊😊😊
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitai watched dark fenix<br>now the last stand is a masterpiece LMAO
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaTrailer was better than the movie itself. Wished Singer stayed on for ONE MORE X-MEN to complete this trilogy.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaAt the end magneto actually handles plastic as well! Facts: True Truth like Jean Grey but humble and lovingkindness not fighting against flesh or basar and blood but against things of higher power and government rulers etc! Such as it’s written in the constitution of the US. Congress ruling etc! But we the people loving mercy and humbling faithful and truth fighting not against the flesh or body and blood but against higher power rulers etc !

ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaUnderage On GMA Afternoon Prime
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaBest movie series I&#39;ve ever seen.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe best Dark Phoenix than Doctor Strange: MOM
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve seen this trailer but I can recite it line for line 😂
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita&quot;A pharmaceutical company has developed a way to suppress your genes, they are calling it a &quot;cure&#39;.&quot; The past 2 years have proven this to be a reality.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaIn hindsight, Last Stand was a better X men movie than most recent x men movies, with the exception of Logan of course
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ0v5dXbw7M&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> Arclight
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaEven though the Cure storyline and Dark Phoenix Saga didn&#39;t mesh well, this movie is still a lot better than Origins and Dark Phoenix.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI like it very much but there are senseless things. If she can do anything, why didnt she atack from the beginnig, so no many other mutans get vaccinted? Or what did they do with that boy? Why didnt they take him to her so she coudnt use her pours?
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaRegardless this being a bad movie it still holds up, great action sequences. Remember seeing this when I was younger and finally seeing beast in action along side logan. Iconic scene when Logan kicked the mutant in the nuts “grow those back!” Lol
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m her 90th sum summers grandkid/ cousin
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaDolo tell your daughter jean grey summer she&#39;s dumb
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaOpening To Bolt ⚡ 2008 DVD 📀 Side B
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaWell one is true hell hath no fury than a woman scorned...
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThere’s not been a good X-men movie (separate from Wolverines) since X-2.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaMan it’s been a minute since I’ve watched any of the X-Men films… it feels good to revisit memory lane.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaSure the script and story were a complete failure as a followup to X2  but my god this is one of the most aggressively entertaining superhero movies ever made! STUNNING cinematography  Exceptional costume design, quality action with plenty of practical effects and convincing CGI, and a thunderous, rousing score! This film is mindless heartwarming popcorn summer cinema at its very best.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe use of rising empire in this trailer still give me chills
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaOpening To X-Men: The Last Stand 2006 DVD
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe worst movie of all the series 🤮. Very weak script and lots of holes in the story.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI missed Bryant in this movie
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitathis movie felt like a joke
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaBased off trailers, you would&#39;ve thought this would be the greatest movie in comic film history
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI never understood why people hated this movie so much. For me it was the best of the first trilogy and I still love it.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaOnce upon a time, this was regarded as the most underwhelming X-Men movie. <br>I’ll gladly take this over many of the movies that came afterwards
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita19 Jan 2022 - I really like this film. I don&#39;t know why it gets the hate. easily 7 out of 10.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaX men last stand english movie back to time all the best action on 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has it’s problems but it’s still a great movie in my opinion. Better and darker than a lot of mcus stuff that’s for sure
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaIf aot final season part 2 will be trailer of x men the last stanf
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaHow is Misty  alive  as a adult in X-Men 1,2,3 but she died as a kid in Dark Phoenix…🤷🏾‍♂️
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaWatch all 3 xmen trailers..and think about it...<br>The XMen are the unvaccinated.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitacovid vax makes humans mutant
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThis X- men can see the future we have the same problem in 2021 with vaccine of the Covid-19!
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe had all the ingredients to make a SPECTACULAR movie, but the way they went about just felt off.<br><br>X Men: Apocalypse had similar problems, I still get goosebumps when watching the trailer for this one AND Apocalypse. They had great actors to work with but the script just wasn&#39;t up to par.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaColosus sure got an upgrade in Deadpool.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI just realized while watching the trailer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ0v5dXbw7M&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a> they show that Cyclops dies by showing his shade&#39;s
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitao melhor filme dos x-men
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaTrop bien x men 3 c&#39;est mon préféré et c&#39;est lafrantement final
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaSuch A Great Movie!
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaFamke Janssen was amazing as Jean Grey. She genuinely acted like she was possessed by the Phoenix.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaone of the very best epic movies ever and one of the very best x men movies ever
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaIs this girl and jean Grey are one (same)  ?????
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaSurprised end is outstanding 🙄🙄🙄
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaMy fav movie rating star 500 ⭐⭐⭐⭐🙄🙄🙄🙄
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaAwsome
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaFriday June 16 2006
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, this movie is overhated. It’s the weakest easily and lacks the style and dark tone of the first two but it has great action, visuals, drama, emotional beats and it’s a great concept for a third movie of a trilogy. 6/10 for me
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita2020 and this trailer still gives me chills.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaFirst three parts are my favorite with the original cast &lt;3
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaTrailer is better than the movie.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita2000 - X-Men <br>2003 - X-Men 2 <br>2006 - X-Men 3 Batalla Final<br>2009 - X-Men Wolverine<br>2011 - X-Men PrimeraGeneración<br>2013 - Wolverine Inmortal<br>2014 - X-Men Días Futuros Pasado<br>2016 - DEADPOOL<br>2016 - X-Men Apocalipsis<br>2017 - Logan<br>2018 - DEADPOOL 2<br>2019 - Dark Phoenix<br>2020 - Los Nuevos Mutantes
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaTo hell with the coronavirus vaccine y&#39;all can go to hell
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThis felt more like an X-Men story than X1 or even X2 imo
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThis film would&#39;ve been better without the dark phoenix stuff and have magneto kill Charles

ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI thought this movie was bad and then all the other X-Men movies came out and I realized there are levels.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI really liked this movie
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaLooking back, I had more fun with this movie than with dark Phoenix. Still prefer days of future past
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshita“X-Men: The Last Stand”.”
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe original X men films will always be the best 👌
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThe original dark Phoenix. Rebecca will always be my favorite mystique, and more beautiful too.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaI didnt like or hate this movie. <br>But I loved the trailer.
ZQ0v5dXbw7MdelimeterByIshitaThis was a very action-packed movie. It had much bigger stakes and much more action.<br>I&#39;ll watch this over Dark Phoenix any day. Plus, Sophie Turner just doesn&#39;t hold a candle to <br>Famke Jannsen. This is also a very cool trailer
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be sweet!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaSomeone youll never have
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting my whole life for this movie...the wait for December is going to be nothing short of AGONIZING.

L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaof course
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaDaft Punk is doing the soundtrack.  Whether or not that&#39;s Daft Punk&#39;s score in the trailer, who knows.  But it sounds awesome.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshita@DesolateMinds ahum... the score is being done by none other than Daft Punk!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaDaft Punk is doing the score.

L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshita@DesolateMinds Daft Punk is doing the score, and that was actually part of the score in the trailer...its going to be AMAZING
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaFlynn lives!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaAll those memories from the first Movie and most if not all the major characters present in the Sequel aswell.

I&#39;m hoping for some jokes related about Nerds ( leetspeak? ), Games ( what&#39;s Sarge from Quake doing here? ), TechSupport ( Who&#39;s General Failure and why is he reading this HD?! ) or something else xD

That&#39;s going to be something to look forward.
But It&#39;s going to take a while ;(
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaLooks Epic1
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the song?
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaThis will either be one of the best, or one of the worst films ever. Fingers crossed for best.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing!!!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! Can&#39;t wait!!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaThis was the only thing I remembered, when I left the cinema, from the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; premiere...
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaWow 1:11 looks oddly great, I thought there was really dust on my screen XD
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitait looks like it&#39;ll either be really good or just terrible. It&#39;s hard to tell from this trailer.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaAs a fan of the original, I can&#39;t wait for this.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaThis could be good.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome, can&#39;t wait
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaAll I can say is &#39;Wow&#39;.  I never thought that it would be possible to recapture the style of the original but the team behind it have done a phenomenal job.  No matter what the film is like as a movie, the look and aesthetic is stomach clenchingly stunning.  The only trouble is that now I have to wait till December!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaWOW!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaNice!!!
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaGreetings program!

L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going SMASH the box office
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaNice. Has a lot of the Dark Knight feel at the start. Visually cool. If that&#39;s the Daft Punk score, I like it.
L9szn1QQfasdelimeterByIshitaYou know what would be really cool? Is if for the release of this movie you guys at Walt Disney bring back VMK :) (Virtual Magic Kingdom for those of you who don&#39;t know) So we can play again in a virtual world, since the Tron movies are baised on a guy who becomes lured into a virtual game:) Not sure how many miss VMK, but I know I do! :)

2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaI really do not care for Anna Kendrick. Move looks so bad.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is in every new movie it seems
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a tom cruise and Cameron Diaz movie I&#39;ve seen before
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaReeeeeaaaaalllyyyy like this movie
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaHit or miss
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaSam Rockwell is such a great actor but he keeps being in such horrible movies hopefully this changes

2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaTIM ROTH IS ACTING IN THINGS AGAIN AND THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaGonna watch it for Rockwell. He&#39;s such an underrated actor.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a typical Bollywood movie, which is very very weird.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a good movie
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaSure I&#39;ll check this out

2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitamy girl ana kendrick
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick makes my sticker peck out.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaAgain I say, Anna Kendrick is one of those actresses who&#39;ll probably do anything.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitais anna kendrick in everything now
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshita&quot;is that guy dead, or...&quot; haha
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaRZA? What kind of name is dat?

2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitatim roth yeaaaaay
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is not my girlfriend in this trailer. DING.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaSam Rockwell, &#39;nuff said
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaI like Sam Rockwell and this seems entertaining enough but why the need for a non necessary romance? Anna Kendrick is better than that by the way.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaAnna Kendrick is Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaae.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaOh movie please be good!! It looks great!!
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaEven though a romantic action comedy, I kinda hope it surprises to the extent that Kingsman did
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks Okay though.....looks clichéd but Okay!!!
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaI looooooove Sam Rockwell so hell yeah I am gonna love this movie no matter if it is good or bad, smart or stupid. :D It´s just going to be one of those guilty pleasure movies no matter what the quality will be like.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Trash﻿
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaIf Sam Rockwell is in it, it&#39;s worth a watch.
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitathis is like the 6th Anna Kendrick movie coming out in 2016
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaSam Rockwell is perfect in everything
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaSam rockwell !
2TatqilQ8rIdelimeterByIshitaYou want me to believe that someone would cheat on Anna Kendrick?

KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitalooks gr8
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s been five years since the second one,and I don&#39;t know how to feel now.

KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThey have English actors in this: Steve Coogan, Rickie Gevais, and they do not sound like that woman!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaMeh..
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaSo...p u mp e.   D
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitafinally they back!!!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaFAT AMY!!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThere are only two intresting chacters in this movie the two really small peopleand this movie looks bad like even worse than the second 1st was good tho
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaMy first reaction:<br> OH SH*T ! F*CK YEAH
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie.  
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI always loved these movies when I was little so I&#39;m happy to see another one!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaShit! Is that Tom Cruise as the stone man?
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaYes!!!!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitai would like always say that, do we really need another move for this<br>but the trailer seemed funny and i may even watch it. 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m English and I&#39;m not sure what accent that English security guard had.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitai actually am so keen for a part 3.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaYAYYYY AMYYY I LOVE HER
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitacant wait

KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaSo classic...they back!!! ---aaaaa
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m ashamed to say this made me laugh
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaNo Amy Adams? :(
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaYES ANOTHER MOVIE MAKING ALL BRITISH PEOPLE LOOK LIKE IDIOTS 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaDude what the fuk is this shit you -_-
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThat last part! Crack me up, hilarious.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaok so all it needed was... NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD AND BLURAY... with the narrators voice...
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitalooks good
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer could&#39;ve done better without the generic &quot;In a world&quot; voice over.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaReally? Another one? You&#39;re beating a dead horse here Ben Stiller...<br><br>...but I&#39;ll still watch it. Good laughs in it I&#39;m sure.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitai think they shot this 3/4 years back and are now releasing it. i say this because in the trailer Ricky Gervais is still fat. 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaBad or not... still going to watch this.... 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaRebel wilson!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so freaking incredibly bad.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaQuoting the last line of the trailer: This movie is unecessary.<br>Really. Hollywood is runing out of ideas aside from a couple of directors.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks pretty good.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaExcited for this! Going to get the first 2 movies and watch them all over again for now=D<br>
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaOh god...Another one.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaRebel wilson &lt;3
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaLooks cheesy, but my kids are going to love it.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitait comes out on my birthday
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaREBEL WILSON!! Wooo wooo wooo 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaGod! To much fcking spoiler
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaFat Amy ;)
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaHaahah :)<br>Nice
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaAbout time
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaAgain!?!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaHmmmm. This looks..... mildly okay. Better than that Smithsonian bullshit
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaJupiters Cock!! Another one? These movies are like lava diarrhea it burns to take them same way... it burns my eyes to watch this garbage. 
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitawell, at least fat amy is in it this time
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaReally, for a trailer where you usually show the best parts of the movie to get people excited, they thought it would be a good idea to end with a money pissing on a Roman gladiator and a cowboy?
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI very rarely laugh at trailers-- especially when I&#39;m just up in the morning --but I laughed a good number of times and was excited to see Owen Wilson and. . . The other dude who&#39;s name I don&#39;t know back as the tiny dudes. This looks great!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThis is either going to be another one of those unnecessary films that shame their franchise or it could actually be quite good
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaWHY ?
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaFat motherfucking Amy is the only reason to watch this awful conclusion
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitarebel wilson made this trailer
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaLol looks nice for a family movie
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI love the fact that there making another one but the trailer looks shitty i hope Its good
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaholy shit. this is EPIC!!!!!!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaLmfao looks nice, imma probably watch
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaoh men,this is gonna be so cool!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaShould have stopped after the first one!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaSeriously, another one!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/KMKk7Dn__-Y?t=2m11s">2:11</a> &quot;You can&#39;t piss on hospitality!&quot;. <a href="http://youtu.be/KMKk7Dn__-Y?t=1m06s">1:06</a> American Ninja reference.
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaYAY! CANT WAIT!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaCan I ask how do you get this video up without getting it blocked ?
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaThe narrator sounds like the honest trailer voice :D Wonder if it is him :)
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitathis is gonna be good ...
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitareally
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait !!!!
KMKk7Dn__-YdelimeterByIshita😱

h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI like to write My dream is to write a movie scenario Like dreams become real I can sell the script of the movie I have written This is my address Hastin Nuraini Jalan Lilin Mas 6 Dadaprejo Junrejo Batu East Java Indonesia Tel: 6281334887683 I also want to have a role as a certain character of the story that I write thank you
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaanne hathaway is angelic.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a gem. I seriously cared so much for the characters. It&#39;s completely different from other romcoms.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaAmazing
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitatrailer makes this look like a crappy romcom but it&#39;s actually a lot deeper than that. there&#39;s a major plot point the trailer doesn&#39;t mention. it doesn&#39;t do it justice
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a cute movie
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI like this song
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie . 9/10 <br><br>😀😁 believe my ratings .. i am a movie freak .
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitagreat film
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitanice
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI always remember Brokeback Mountain when I see the both of them. 😂
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaHE LOOKS LIKE CLAY FROM OTH
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s a Jake Gyllanhaal movie I didn&#39;t watch omg , you know it&#39;s gonna be good when he&#39;s in it , exactly what I was looking for
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaJust Like Heaven by The Cure. Animal by Neon Trees. Beautiful Girl by INXS. And not in this trailer, but was in another, Feeling The Moment by Feeder. ☺ YW! ☺
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6w7Dh-QxzY&amp;t=1m12s">1:12</a> in the movie they are bottom naked... funny how they censured them XD
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaDid they need to tell the whole movie in the trailer? Blah.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI am usually untouched by romantic movies, but, hell, this movie made me cry
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s such a good movie. I think many people with either mental illness or physical illness can maybe relate to Maggie. I have social anxiety and I searched for movies with characters that deal with SAD or anxiety disorder in general, but I couldn&#39;t relate to any of them. And then I saw this movie, didn&#39;t thought I could relate to that at all, but even though Maggie has parkinson, I could totally feel what she was going through. The shaking of parkinson, reminded me of my shaking when I get anxious or panic attacks in public. And that she didn&#39;t let anyone close to her in the fear someone might leave bc of her illness, it&#39;s the same for me to be honest. And this movie is so great and inspiring. It gives me kinda strength, that even if I&#39;m different than other people, there is no shame etc. Also just btw jake gyllenhaal is so handsome!! And anne hathaway is so stunning and beautiful!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6w7Dh-QxzY&amp;t=0m56s">0:56</a> make up fail!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaToo cringe for me ! <br><br>I am single by choice !
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitawhy did they put the cure`s song in the trailer but not in the movie??   im so disapointed...
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaIt looks terrible but the comments are so positive, may chance this one.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitafirst 30 sec he looks like dave franko
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitagreat movie; it&#39;s so underrated... if you thinking of watching it; watch it!!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaINXS :)
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitawho
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitawhy is no one screaming at the fact that i just saw katheryn winnick at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6w7Dh-QxzY&amp;t=0m08s">0:08</a>. So gorgeous as always. Hello vikings lovers
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaTHE BEST!!!!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaMy Childhood XD Ella Enchanted just died for me.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitashows too much in the trailer, if you haven&#39;t seen the movie don&#39;t watch the traier. You&#39;ve been warned.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitalove them being together since brokeback mountain
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaWhat the song at 1.40 ?
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaanna hathway ruined the movie
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaya this is NOT  about drugs....
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS MOVIE SOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>M       U        C         H
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaAnybody has the soundtracks for this movie?
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the worst pieces of immoral garbage I ever saw. Couldn&#39;t even watch the whole thing.<br><br>Please don&#39;t waste your time.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI♡u jake
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitai blame Julie Andrew
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaThe whole movie right here, why would I need to watch the full version??? The trailers today!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaSaw this movie last night for the first...do not regret it at all!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS MOVE!!!!!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaTrailer of nowadays: the perfect way to spoiler the most part of the film!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI never cried so much for a romantic comedy
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaNever heard of this movie until now! But seeing all the good commets, I&#39;m going to watch it tonight!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitais it weird that I hate every woman Jake kisses or something... Jake u really need to marry me!! 😹😹
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaJake is my favourite actor of all time and he&#39;s so handsome!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaWatched it recently! I absolutely loved it! Jake and Anne were awesome with great chemistry! And made me shed a tear! One of my favourite movies ever 😊❤️❤️
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the few romantic comedies/ dramas that I can really get into. 
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaCan someone upload the movie love and other drugs, its my favorite! :))
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI absolutely love this movie. It takes a lot to make me cry cause I&#39;m a huge romantic tragedy type of girl but this movie had me on the verge of tears and I absolutely loved the ending. &quot;You meet thousands of people and none of them really touch you and then you meet one person and you&#39;re life is changed... forever..&quot; My favorite quote of all time! :&#39;)
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitainxs
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaok so they purposely left out the actual problem in the film, no? Bad move tbh because now everyone thinks it&#39;s a romcom and not a sort of tragic love story
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitacan someone tell me the name of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6w7Dh-QxzY&amp;t=1m09s">1:09</a> please and thank you.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaFantastic! 
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI get that a lot of people think this is just a super cheesy movie. I actually felt the same way when I first saw the trailer, and thought it was just another &#39;Friends With Benefits&#39; or &#39;No Strings Attached&#39;. Truth is that this movie does have a lot more going for it than just comedy or cheese. I actually cried in this movie, and was greatly amused by the jokes. The actors have chemistry, the dialogue is good. It was a good movie. Don&#39;t think this trailer shows the whole move. Trust me.... It actually doesn&#39;t.<br>Hope you enjoy!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaThe movie looks amazing, but I mean, the trailer gave it all away! Even to the smallest details and jokes! I feel like I have already watched it.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshita2:01 lovely scene!!! :)
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI told my friend about this movie once, she&#39;s said it sounds babyish. She knows that this movie contains skin, viagra and sex. You know for kids! Gosh people can be so stupid.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitahey lisa~!

h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaone of my favorite songs by the cure just like heaven, also Neon trees . Seems like a good movie. 
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaTons of sex and laughts! In a year of bad romcoms this one shines on all the others!
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaHe is a prince.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pretty sure that Anne Hathaway screams &quot;FUCK!&quot; at 2:24 if you listen hard enough.
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshita@WhoCaresFU not really. personally i think that would be hilarious =P
h6w7Dh-QxzYdelimeterByIshita@sunnybaison 上不上映还是另外一回事， 下载吧哈哈

BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaGuardians of peace hackers are hacked sony as a warning sign for not to release this movie. Anyhow they released in ott and earned lot of money😂
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI love this movie. Thank God we live in Mother efing  U.S.A.

BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaLooking back a this while the film was funny satirizing North Korea and its leadership was not really a brilliant idea since the premise of the movie was threatened with violence.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaTeenage mutant ninja turtles cg animated movie
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI saw this movie it&#39;s so funny
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThe whole trailer and I am like &quot;Another fucked up movie idea that is jusy random and chaotic&quot;, but why include North Korea? You wanna draw them out of their panic room? Or what is exactly happening?
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaearlier it was free to view on youtube..now its paid...bad

BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshita0.55 sec epic. 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitabomba kinodu 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s so many deleted scenes in this trailer.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThis movie was fucking awesome.  Never seen James Franco so funny :)
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWhy does the Korean leader hate this man it&#39;s funny we still like the guy I wouldn&#39;t talk it so mean I mean it&#39;s just a movie I would ask if they didn&#39;t make a movie of me atleast three times 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve heard stories of people who escaped from North Korea,North Korea is f*<b>*</b> psychotic.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThis was such a funny movie although very crude the ending was phenomenal and worth it  
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThis looks really dumb. 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaFucking Awesome!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitacould they make a movie about killing obama? or any other first world leader at that?<br><br>fuck. no. they would get raped by intelligence agensies and their careers would be destroyed. if they were even allowed to shoot it that is.<br><br>so gtfo. they should&#39;ve used a fake leader.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitapls  I want to see this movie , I am not afraid I will go to movie theater.  Before that I didn&#39;t want to go to movie theater , I wanted to wait and watch it at home, but now I will go to movie theater and watch it . plsssss just increase the security or just put it on DVD or on line somewhere that people can watch it . I think this is going to be the best comedy ever. 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaGlad this movie was cancelled. It&#39;s a great victory for liberals around the world! Movie this racist/offensive shouldn&#39;t exist. Fuck off conservatives!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaRIP my chances of seeing this movie :C
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitanever forget 9/11
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitapretty sad to see how the people threatening the release of this movie are acting... they call it terrorism when it&#39;s a comedy film and then.. threaten its release with actual terrorism... so I&#39;m not sure if they are stupid, special, or what...  there have been plenty of movies where authoritative figures get assassinated (yes this includes presidents, but we didn&#39;t threaten ACTUAL TERRORISM for a comedy film)
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaNo one they put up threats.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaHackers threathened to blow up all the theaters that will play that movie? Srsly wow...
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWell we are all going to die.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI bet this whole &#39;hack&#39; thing is just a publicity stunt. Gotta drum up attention for another shitty seth rogen film, and of course &#39;annie&#39;. I&#39;d rather go to a north korean prison camp than sit through more of this garbage. Sony can&#39;t do anything right lately.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitabloody north korea at work
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaReminds me of The Dictator.  Definitely worth a shot...  
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaYou know in WW2 they made movies showing other leaders of countries ( Germany,Italy) being bad guys to get people to help the war cause?
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWow American media and Hollywood pedaling garbage to the dumb ass masses. That makes sense! :)
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaKeeping N. Korea fed means maintaining a strategy of tension.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWe&#39;ll never &quot;take N. Korea out&quot; &#39;cause we always need a neighborhood baddie to keep the neighborhood in line; otherwise, we would lose at least some regional relevance.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaGod is love.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaEVERYONE  SEE WHIPLASH AT A THEATER ASAP GREAT FILM!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI was kinda of excited for this, but this trailer was so unfunny...
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI wonder if South Korea is going to have a tailgating party for this movie?
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;M TIRED OF WAITING FOR THIS FUCKING MOVIE TO COME OUT. I GUESS THIS WILL BE MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWorld War III
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitapoor Rob
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaWorld War 3 this christmas
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaIts going to release in  the US 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitathis movie is banned in vietnam-wow i can only watch it when the record version came out
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaAnd now Kim Jong Un has gone missing in real life. Too funny!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen Is In Every Thing.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaA movie about killing north korea&#39;s leader... Not some... Made up leader. It&#39;s Kim. What? Are... You even allowed to... The backlash... The fucking backlash... How is anyone even allowed to make this a movie, in good concience? It&#39;d be like a movie about killing obama and his family. I&#39;m not saying what kim does is good; hell, the atrocities he warrants in his countey are unacceptable... But to actually joke about it, involve the CIA, give it to the guys who made this is the end; this is insulting on so many levels... How have I not heard of this yet? Damn... It started off so well, looked like it would shit on TMZ, the asshats of tge universe, but no... A comedy movie about killing Kim. What the actual fuck... I think dinosaur transformers would have been a good enough hint the movie industry is dying, but this made me double take. I... Don&#39;t even know what else to say. I... Applaud this movie&#39;s original concept, i guess? 0_0
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaYou know I usually dont even give the youtube ads the time of the day. But this looks like a funny movie. Liked
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaKim Jong-un + James Franco &amp; Seth Rogen = the best film of all time.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BObCk4wKLn0&amp;t=0m42s">0:42</a> &quot;Hate us &#39;cause they anus.&quot;
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaLooks awful, the only good comedy director is Edgar Wright 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a horrible idea and anyone affiliated with it is a fool.   Why go out of your way to offend the North Koreans?
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitathis blows....zzzzzzzzzzzz
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BObCk4wKLn0&amp;t=2m29s">2:29</a> &#39;for more from these western capitalist pigs&#39; haha
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThis is a seth Rogen movie so im gonna call that there is a scene that they get high with Kim
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaAnd americans wonder why everyone hates them
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshita&quot;From the guys who brought you THIS IS THE END&quot; What a sentence to make me NOT want to watch a film.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaIf any other country made a video like this about an American leader it would be labelled terrorism.<br>Hollywood propaganda at its best.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitagaaaay they pushed it back to december bunch of weinies
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BObCk4wKLn0&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> Joseph Gordon-Levitt &lt;3

BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitameh
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaFunny concept, but the movie itself doesn&#39;t look funny. 
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaCant wait till Xmas!!!!! The package is secure!!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t laugh once. Also, I doubt anyone will be in theaters watching this on Christmas Day. I hope this bombs at the box office.
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaAin&#39;ters gonna ain&#39;t
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitawe&#39;re not gonna let another country shut us up! whaat are we ? pussies? RELEASE THIS SHIT WITH A  KOREAN DUB, AND FUCKING SHIP HIM A COPY OF THE BLU-RAY CD<br>!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaDid they took north korean decision? I mean if they didn&#39;t then like why they AREN&#39;T AFRAID OF DEATH!!!!!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaThe reason for world war 3 right here haha!
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitabrilliant 👌😂
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaDunno
BObCk4wKLn0delimeterByIshitaDERS!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@faysalbuu  well, when he gets out of prison maybe...

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Micheal? 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI AM SO SICK OF THIS CLICHE SHIT !
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita&quot;We will stand and fight&quot; - sounds like the movie 300 :)
btw will we see Michael again?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@novalizard  I was thinking the same thing, It seems such a small scene but it had a big impact in the second movie that would change Selene forever, after such a long time between movies...well for this day and age anyway I would expect the disappointment, they may not make it a big deal and over look her *new* abilities somewhat.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI really hope they don&#39;t forget that Selene is more than a vampire. For those who might have forgotten, she ingested Alexander Corvinus&#39; blood near the end of Evolution. We then saw the past--which was awesome--and now we finally get to see what happens after the second movie. I&#39;m really hoping that with all this time, they haven&#39;t forgotten this very cool/interesting fact that Selene isn&#39;t a vampire and is something more. Regardless! I am so eager for this movie, it&#39;s not even funny.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s very hard for me to resist any movie with Kate in it.  ;)
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitawe have a nother w w wod movie.  now they put the sicty of leopole in it.  hunter the recning any 1.

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@MrRenevelez  He didn&#39;t die in Evolution
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@xKontagionx more like BACK!!!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaif you don&#39;t like 3D, don&#39;t friggin see it in 3D...stop complaining
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@Adamas97 oh ja....hope this film ist much better than the last Resident Evil.....in 3D.....
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWait a second, where&#39;s michael, is she refering to the half vampire half Lycan guy wasn&#39;t he killed in evolution. And why it has to be in 3D
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@ebrhymes your comprehension of the last movie needs improved. go watch it...twice
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitayes!!!!! I&#39;m excited!!!!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaKate,Kate,Kate ooooo Kate!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaZOMG YESSSSSSSSSS!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitai thought that the curse was broken considering the ending of evolution?
(i geus they will explain themselves in this one)
=P

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI fucks with that they brought it back but it doesn&#39;t make since because at the end of underworld evolution they&#39;re were no more vampires lycans or hybrids every lycan or vampire turned back to normal because both william and marcus were dead so it just doesn&#39;t make since to me. 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@xbimpyx You, do not know who you are fucking with! How can you not love that line from Blade 2? lolz
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaSo when does this movie take place? before the 1st or right after ROTL?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Micheal!! Woooooooo can&#39;t wait to check this movie out
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaFucking awesome!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like the Human hunters in this are kinda badass.  I&#39;ve been waiting on a movie where the HUMANS are actually just as or more badass than the supernatural creatures and this look like this may be it.  I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed though.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaUmm...Thought she was a half breed now?

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita1:29 Did she just threw that van?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaUnderwolrd is so fucking awesome! But I think it&#39;s very hard to top &quot;Evolution&quot;! marcus and William were just to bad ass!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t saw Speedman on the cast list :((((( 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@Sarah404 Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve been thinking since I found out Scott Speedman isn&#39;t in it. Way to screw it up. It should have started with them standing in the sun in the castle at the end of 2. This may be ok, but if they&#39;ve killed Michael with a throwaway line it&#39;ll be so freaking lame. Here&#39;s hoping for a part 5 and a proper reuniting.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitawhen she said where&#39;s Michael was anyone else thinking the same thing.. i like the half breed 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to find out what happened to Michael! It better not be some lame ass story like &quot;He just died &gt;.&gt;&quot; This movie has serious potential! Completely bummed the other 3! I hope this one doesn&#39;t let its predecessors down!  
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitawhere is micheal corvin

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU 3D

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitamichaels dead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@TheWerewolfLycan .......Oh.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@kriztinoiz91 have you read twilight, the cullens are the only &quot;good&quot; vampires, all the rest in twilight are evil and kill people, and the wolves in twilight are shapeshifters,the werewolf&#39;s in twilight where all killed by the Volturi because the werewolfs were killing people and killed an important person to one of the Volturi. Dont judge all vampires in twilight just because of the cullens-only 8,all the other ones were killers.plus Twilight is a romance story, This is action, action&gt;love
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI am losing my mind! SOO excited.

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitafor the sake of shafting twilight hell yes, but in reality this will suck ha ha
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@TheWerewolfLycan ohhhh....ok :)
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else roll their eyes when it said &quot;3D&quot;
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaman kate beckinsale hot!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@WeylandYutaniInc91 Good theories man. But he could just be missing and she&#39;s just looking for him for most  of the film. But I hope to god they didn&#39;t kill him off. But my questions is how the hell did she end up captured anyway? They better have a hell of a  good explanation for what happened in the 12 year leap between 2 and this film.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YEAAAAAAA oh and Twilight? SUCK IT BITCHES...
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov another good question would be, how did Selene become a vampire all over again in the first place???
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov on the IMDB cast...he&#39;s just...not the movie, lest its not another prequel...but still probably won&#39;t be much of a good sequel without em either :(
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaSQUEEEE
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaDam I was hoping the Lycans and vamps would jion forces againts the humans that would be even better.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitait looks cool. it also looks like they copied every single shot and special effect from the first film.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaMove over Twilight and True Blood.  Underworld is here.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! it looks amazing! BTW: Are the stories of Nissa(Her daughter) true??!?!?!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitakate shouldve fell outta that glass chamber with her legs spread pointinng towards us.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be there on opening day. Can&#39;t wait!

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@1CLKL No problem
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaYESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov So far we know, Scott Speedman, who played Michael, is not going to be in this movie. So I have three theories on where Michael is. Either, he&#39;s dead, or they replaced him, or, and this is my big theory, he&#39;s mutated into a more powerful monster with no control of himself and is forever stuck that way and is the villain of this movie. That&#39;s my theory.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov I don&#39;t hope so. Michael :( It would be less fun
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YOU TWILIGHT THIS IS A REAL VAMPIRE MOVIE!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaFUCK twilight!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov i don&#39;t know what can do such thing.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaNICE
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@LastForgottenNinja I vaguely remember that when they were to kill the brothers (vampire and werewolf) that all others would turn back to human and the main character came in contact with sunlight after that...
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI jizzed in my pants 2 times. 1 for the lycans 1 for the vampires.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@WanderLink Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula.....now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@MortalSyntax they never said they were none as far as i was aware..i mean..they dont exist in the rest of world?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@OceansideRoberts In 2011, they announced that there was going to be another Underworld movie, it was mentioned in the Summary.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@tomfletonhater2 Aaaah Thanks! I was wondering the same thing.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@MortalSyntax I know right? What happened to that?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaUm...i thought there were no more vampires and werewolves...
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaBooooooorrrrrrrrinnnnnnnnnnnnnnng!!!!!!!!!!!!!

tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaThat looked like a very big Lycan at the end.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@Cerberusballs Actually they didnt she could just walk in the sun because of the blood she drank from marcus&#39; father.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI guess I will add my 2 cents one being Selene drank Alexander Corvinous&#39;s blood which is why she was able to defeat Marcus and go in the sunlight! What I would like to know is she she still the strongest vampire and what happened to Michael? How does the 2 strongest immortals get captured and held for 12 years?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov He&#39;s not listed in the cast at IMDb... so
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaOMG OMG OMG OH MY FUCKING GOD!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWheres Micheal?!?!?
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitamovie looks BAD ASS HOPE THE NEW HYBRIDS LOOK AWESOME 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaHey, wait just a damn minute!!  At the end of Evolution, didn&#39;t Marcus, the originator of all vampires, get thrown into a fucking chopper rotor?  And didn&#39;t Selene, along with every single vampire on the fucking planet, get cured?  What the hell happened to continuity??
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaOMFG i cant wait to see this....i love underworld,best vampire movie :D 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita&quot;I was held captive for 12 years.&quot;

You&#39;re still being held captive, and your captor is named Len Wiseman.


tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaRAZE!!!!!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@KimDat5StarChick They do have a daughter! Her name is Eve! She will be in the movie!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@yaoigoddess16 She didn&#39;t become human she became &#39;the future&#39; think of it as Blade, she became a daywalker but she remains a vampire, only stronger.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@AlexDergousov Michael has been recast. Different actor.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaShe did not become human. She became more stronger, well, I think she is the most stronger now. And she can stand the sun.@yaoigoddess16 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaThis series is needed to undo the horrible image Twilight painted vampires and lycan with
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaThis would be better then Twilight. This is a truthly vampire movie.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaI bet Michael is the monster (they don&#39;t have to use the real actor, but the character is still in the movie) and their daugter Eve as a hybrid of all of them lol will probably be the only one strong enough to defeat him... There, I cracked the story rofl! 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaKate Backinsale is still hot has hell! :D
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaIf there is a daughter story line, that&#39;s probably the new monster, raised by Michael while Selene was imprisoned. With a Lycan-hybrid father and Vampire-Corvinus hybrid mother, you better believe it&#39;s strong.
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshita@thisiscanton I totally get you on this one, Resident Evil: Afterlife did the same for me and now Underworld is coming and I can&#39;t wait ♥!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWhere is MICHAEL??? 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWTF HAPPEN TO NEW DAWN..THEY CHANGED THE WHOLE STORY LINE...SELENE AND MICHAEL, SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DAUGHTER!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWHERES MICHAEL
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitathis is how vampire and wolfs movie should be!!! TAKE THAT TWILIGHT!
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitabest vampire ever..... twilight sucks in front of this one...... 
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitawhat does she say on 1:16? who is more powerful then any of them i cant get what she says really Oo
tUcrbUCWKQcdelimeterByIshitaWhere the hell is Michael? God, i hope they don&#39;t kill him off.

8lnzoZBC3ugdelimeterByIshita<b>*</b> Spoiler <b>*</b> This movie kinda sucks balls. That said, the part where the female lead snips off her own clitoris with a pair of dirty ol scissors is the only movie scene that ever literally made me cover my eyes and turn my face.

8lnzoZBC3ugdelimeterByIshitaThat’s my Friday night honey
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI never thought Ben Stiller is an oscar guy and I thought he probably never will be but this movie looks really nice so Im expecting from it pretty much and I would be happy if Ben would get one :)
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaReview this trailer.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaThe Scorcher appears! 0:40
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitathis is the way a trailer should be.... i know enough to be interested, but not enough to feel like I just watched the whole thing. It also helps that this movie looks amazing
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitawoah i never thought ben stiller would act
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaExactly!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI love the short story of the same name! &lt;3 excited
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIt would be awesome if Ben Stiller got an Oscar
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaOnly in US!!! So pissed
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s only available in the US! xD
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaWow really stupid-   .   -
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaUm... Why is his movie not available in his country? Well good because he&#39;s a shit actor
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIm sorry i thought this was America!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitanot available in your country... Ok, unsubscribe
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaDude . . . What the fuck
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaFox have banned it for copyright ?
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaNot in this country?!?!? BITCH hold my whev
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaMy phone says that this trailet is unavailable in my country. How the f, I&#39;m in god damn america
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitay u no play?
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaWrote an essay on it.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about a man who uses his imagination to get away from his ordinary live
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaRegion locked :P
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaSecret message &quot;the red one&quot;....mad tricks
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaRegion locked yeah!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaNo it looks like a movie about a guy who enjoys nature and is tired of working in an office so he heads north to get back into the wilderness. But hey that&#39;s just what I saw. 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaThe red car blue car moment. A Matrix reference maybe?

QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitathanks. i only hear their godawful music about 8,000 times a day on the radio to know their name already.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitait looks visually stunning, i hope the story is good too...
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI support this 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI enjoyed the short story this is based of
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaback to comedy ben..
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaDanny Kaye&#39;s was great. I grew up on it...this looks more serious than the original.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know but I didn&#39;t really like the music choice.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, hopefully no weird Ben Still humor going on :D 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaBetter watch this movie high
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitacant wait for night at museum 3
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaalways choose the red pill!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitasmells like an oscar
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI looked this movie up and found out its a remake. The orginial came out in 1947
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIn what possible way does this look &quot;fanmade&quot;?  It&#39;s cut together with the kind of precision a seriously experienced professional editor would have.


QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaicelandic song... and most of the movie happens in iceland... i´m from iceland...but we don´t look like an albino,, but love the movie !

QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitabeautiful looking movie
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer, intriguing yet restrained, a rare thing these days.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaWow, seems great
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitalooks like a fanmade trailer but the actual movie seems good
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaEpic longboardin scene!! I&#39;d love to go there!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaWalter Mitty: which car do you choose?
The Matrix: which pill will you take?

QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome good work ben
 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaFinally. A trailer that doesn&#39;t actually reveal the whole fkn movie...
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaBen Stiller on a movie which can actually be good and smart? Wow...
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaBen Stiller directed this movie himself; it looks pretty good. I really like the elements that were used in the trailer. The cinematography looks amazing as well.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaLooks really unique!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaOf monsters and men :D
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitajust realized ben directed this movie himself, looks fucking good
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaThis is how I live my life. Imagining it were better.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitawow this looks really interesting
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaBen Stiller doing a weird serious movie? Cool!
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaBecause it looks halfway decent and kind of meaningful. 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s based on the same short story as the original, but this should be rather different from the original film e.g. it&#39;s not a musical.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaCloset full of skateboard mags at the beginning...
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s a remake. Same story, same name.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaSort of a Forest Gump-ish feel to it.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see it
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaI hope there&#39;s a trailer review of this.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitais this a remake of the original or just inspired by it?
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitais the unofficial movie michel Gondry?
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshita-___- is this a comedy??? a drama??? an action movie??? i dont even think the movie knows what it is! smh, i dont even think Ben Stiller knows what hes doing being he hasnt made a good movie in YEARS! ill pass. 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaumm... yeah, that was totally unexpected. 
hope it&#39;s good
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitacan not stop watching this trailer, everything about it just feels so right. 
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaThanks dude
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaNice and the short story 1939 and the other film from 47 were good also most likely check this out
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks FANTASTIC.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaNo one will see it.
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaIt actually looks pretty good !
QD6cy4PBQPIdelimeterByIshitaWow looks great

JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitathis actually looks good
JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitaWhy bad things only happen to Liam Neeson?

JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitaFIRST!
JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitaLooks a lot better than the 2nd one, but that&#39;s a pretty low bar.  And unfortunately the director of the 2nd one is returning.

JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitaOh damn I hope it&#39;s not as awful as the previous one. The first movie was badass, the second one was just garbage.
JuU0M2xBascdelimeterByIshitaFirst!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaPerfect. Except for when prim said: katniss.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaJ. Lawrence is fuck amazing

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitano it&#39;s not!

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait :-D
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitawow.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaFinally!!!!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaagreed 
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaCool
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitajennifer lawrence is very fuckable.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaYou haven&#39;t read the books... have you? :L
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshita2:20 Is that an IMAX sequence? :P
Seems like this movie will alternate between 2.39:1 and 1.78:1 (for IMAX scenes) like The Dark Knight :P
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaguh?
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitai really cant wate :O

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t spoil it for the people who haven&#39;t read it :P

Have they missed out on an epic book? Yes..
Should they have read it? Yep..
Should you still spoil it for them? No...
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaJSKDJASKDJASKDJAKSJDASKKDASKDKASD
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t Cecelia on the pedestal with all of the other tributes on 1:47?
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitacool, comes out on my bday.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaOMFG OMFG OMFG FANGIRLING
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaTHAD!!!!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaA bit unfamilar scenes from the book
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitayou have issues. and obviously didnt read the book. its not an ocean, its the setting for the 75th hunger games and the quarter quell. its a lake. actually a clock, because looking from a aerial view, its put into sections like a clock, with the lake in the center.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaanyone noticed that the black bars went up when she jumped in the water
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be waay better than the first one
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaJust seeing Finnick, Enobaria, Johanna and even Gloss gave me chills...
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitalets hope it&#39;s not bad as the first one
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitathinking about it now, i wouldnt win but id still manage to make it somewhere near the end, swim and drown people
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitayes love hunger games cause of Jennifer Lawrence
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitano if you read the books, not to insult, its says that this hunger games tributes are previous victors
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is freakin awesome .
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaDid I just see Thad Castle?
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaOHMYGOD I CANT WAIT

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaLove the camera shot when they get ready to fight when it expands!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitathat was for spongebob28
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI sure hope it is because the Second Book was AMAZEBALZ!!! 
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaNo, since Katniss AND Peeta won the year before instead of one victor, the quater quell came up (speciality every 25 years) and the speciality was that people who have won in the past are going back in (but only some, not every winner). Prim was never actually in any of the games so she never could have been picked again.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaohhh SHE JUMPED TO THE SEA WOW SO EPIC -_-
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaim so pumped
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitano dumbass its the existing victors they even stated it in the trailer
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaHopefully i like this one
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHHH!!!!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaWait shes joining the game again man wtf.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaThe first one was shit, but this could be freakin AWSOME.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaGot nothin on the books
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaOh yeah, but I mean another one..no way people would put up with over 70 Hunger Games. If I was a tribute I would&#39;ve gotten close to the president and assassinated him or something.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaIf i was in this one it&#39;d be screwed from the start, i haven&#39;t swam in ages XD
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaDid prim get picked again?
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitawe as a people need to stop worrying about whether or not a movie based on a book is going to follow that book because let&#39;s be honest...its NEVER GOING TO FOLLOW THE FUCKING BOOK GET OVER IT. so if a movie based on ur favorite book is being made don&#39;t watch it or watch and don&#39;t complain please
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitathere was.... have you read the books????
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaomg this looks amazing.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaWant a sugar cube? ^^
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaOMFG
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaNOPE NOPE NOPE NOT WAITING I WANT THIS MOVIE NOW 
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaOmfg
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI think if this happened in real life their would&#39;ve been a revolution much sooner.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaWant a sugar cube? ^^
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI got to admit, at first I thought the movie was going to a bit of a let down, but after seeing this trailer it looks really good.
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaPrim&#39;s screaming wasn&#39;t as epic as last year lol
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitatrailer showed way to much but looks LEGIT

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaI love the books and the movie!! And this Trailer is Very awesome!!!
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitathis looks better than the first one that was kinda disappointing compared to the book
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaFinally,the trailer on HD quality! =))

EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshita2nd comment
EAzGXqJSDJ8delimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer!!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitabetter be a 3 tittied bitch in this lmao

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaHis reference was from the original Total Recall.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaGet your ass to mars.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitai like the trailer it will be awesome 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaSo will I, it looks good. 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI feel so sorry for the 12 year olds who are gonna waste their time with this &quot;Total Bullshit&quot; of a remake instead of watching the great 90s version.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaOPEN YOUR MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitawhy no more turtle in video these days...
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaquuaaaaaid....start the reactor
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitasame movie different people booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaSo no Mars? wtf

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaIt has nothing to do with not reading, people expect movies to be made from popular novels by the same name, not short stories or novellas released only in collections with vastly different titles. Even if someone knew Total Recall was based on &#39;We Can Remember it for You Wholesale&#39; there is only one collection including it with that title.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaAnd the idea of implanting memories and flying cars is soooo realistic...
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think its a remake, its an adaptation of We can Remember it for you Wholesale, its just the fact that Total Recall is more marketable.  Don&#39;t blame the movie blame the producers.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a shame he wont get his ass to mars
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaeh....
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaBOOOOOOO
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaAt the party.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI will go see it.

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaMost? As if this is the first absolutely unoriginal screenplay. Hollywood is infested with them. Nothing but remakes and half-ass books to movie.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaSeeing it cause Kate Beckinsale

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaTotal Bullshit
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitai think i just jizzed in my pants
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible because their is no arnold schwarzenegger
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaGET YOUR ASS TO MARS!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck? this better still be about creating an atmosphere on mars with alien technology or Ima be fucking PISSED
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitapeople are acting like there not gonna see this, when august arrives they&#39;ll be in line because this probably the best release in that month hands down
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitamost people these days don&#39;t know that Phillip K Dick wrote the original!  especially since it was written way back in 1966! kids tend not to read any more sadly  lol  ;)
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale AND Jessica Biel in one movie? You have my money
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitawow that fight scene looked really fake...
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale - Worth the price of admission, and where&#39;s Richter!?
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaWhy has no one read We Can Remember It for You Wholesale?!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;ve never read &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; have you? Derp Herp.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitai would say its a reboot this looks nothing like the old one!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaWhy is everyone on youtube a whiny little bitch. Shut up and watch the trailer. Your going to watch the movie, you know you will. 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaCohaagen you got what you want. Give these people air!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty cool.

If this gets good reviews, I may see it when it comes out.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaWHY YOU TRYING TO KILL MEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaWhy must every sci-fi/action movie trailer have Transformers garble sounds?
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNope.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI think Colin will be better than Arnie.

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to this 110%!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaBad arse, strictly bad arse!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNo 3 tits no good

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaDo they even go 
to Mars in this?

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaso basically...longest spoiler trailer ever, only to show that they&#39;ve copied the other total recall scene for scene
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m already calling the ending. 
All of that is just a fake memory

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaThey took a movie that was already totally amazing and made it more amazing visually.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaanother shitty remake??
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit. I&#39;m so going to see this. ^^
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNope.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshita&quot;original film&quot; lol
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think you realize how stupid you just made yourself look.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitajust goes to show the staying power of Phillip K Dicks amazing writing!  written in 1966, the man was ahead of his time, literally! 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitai&#39;m pretty sure i just watched the whole movie
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaIdk about this. I hope it doesn&#39;t go overboard with the cgi and keeps the signature Paul Verhoeven gory over the top violence that the original had. Still looks good though.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaOr how to go from &quot;I don&#39;t give a shit&quot; to &quot;oh god I can&#39;t wait to see this&quot; in two minutes and twenty seven seconds.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaarnold cameo?
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaonly seeing this for Jessica Biel. Other than that, looks pretty predictable.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitathis is a remake of the original
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaI miss arnold. 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaYOU!!! BLEWHH!!!! MA!!! COVA!!!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNoooo shhhitttt Really you don&#39;t say 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitawasnt there another total recall with arnold in it 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitacmon cohagen.... give these people back their arnie!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s got Kate Beckinsale, right off the bat it&#39;s got my vote. Plus I&#39;ve always liked Colin Ferrell, sure in real life he&#39;s an asshole drug user (or was anyway) but he&#39;s a decent actor and generally plays the roles he&#39;s cast very well. 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaif its rated pg-13 ill be so pissed
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaGET YOUR ASS TO MARS!!!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaawesome.. Outstanding...
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNothing is as brutal without Ahhnold!

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaOk, this is a little bit better on the random capitalization, but there&#39;s still room for improvement. You can do it, I believe in you!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaTWO WEEKS!
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaPlease, just stop posting. Just stop. 
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitahonestly this is going to suck you did a copy of the original conan and it was horrible now its total recall if you want it to be good get arnold and if terminator or commandos next then we could already predict what the worlds movie future will be and its not a good one
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaLooks only &quot;ok&quot;
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshita@theylive1984rm Hey Guess what?... Nobody cares. :)

GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaWow, I could be a tree.
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaOnce again, looks pretty far off from the book that inspired it
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitawheres 3 boobies lady
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitakate bekinsales a babe
GljhR5rk5eYdelimeterByIshitaNot a fan of Colin Ferell, but I&#39;&#39; watch it to compare it to the Arnold film.
