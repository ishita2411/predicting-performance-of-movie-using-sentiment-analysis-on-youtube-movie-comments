Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaI dont like it...i fucking love it! One of my favorite movies! Pura poes√≠aüëç
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaAcabo de ver esta pel√≠cula, creo que algo anda mal conmigo puesto que tuve enormes arranques de placer durante todo su rodaje.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaHow to get angry an Argentine? Telling him he is Brazilian.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitakheeee? no es Brazil pelotudo es argentina
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaGreat movie, brilliant, and really funny and violent
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil... Epic fail! lol
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaActors speak Spanish; no way it could be Brazilian then...
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaWhat a brilliant trailer üëç
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitawait a minute... is it brazil or argentina now... i‚Äôm not so shure now anymore having read the comments... hahaha
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaWhat a great movie
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaüîëüîëüîëüåü
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBought this from my local second hand dvd shop for ¬£4, totally totally brilliant...!!!  (spent ¬£21 at my local Vue to watch The Snowman and its awful) Six short movies about revenge, anger and getting your own back, loved it from start to finish, especially the road rage film, i was laughing so hard, its sooo funny and total black humour, lose your inhibitions about sub-titles and watch these films somehow or other, then spread the word
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitacan all of you chill the hell out! okay its from Argentine now can you tell us if its a good movie?
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaTruly a masterpiece of Brazilian cinema, even better than City of God and Elite Squad.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrasil?? Esta peli es de Argentina gringo boludo!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshita·Éî·É° ·Éê·É†·Éò·É° ·É§·Éò·Éö·Éõ·Éò
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaReminds me of Cloud Atlas.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitathis is my first and best Spanish movie in my life
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitai highly highly recommend you watch this movie. you won&#39;t regret it.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshita&quot;BRAZIL&quot; ANTHOLOGY? <br>it&#39;s argentine wtffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil? WTF
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrilliant Film with interesting plots üòé
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThe film is from Argentina. The film is in Spanish. In BRAZIL they speak PORTUGUESE! In ARGENTINA they speak SPANISH!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrasil? Jaja no entienden nada de idiomas en Brasil es el portugu√©s y ac√° es el espa√±ol castellano
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThis channel should be banned for divulging wrong information in the videos. If you want to load a trailer you should first check about what country is the movie from. The man behind this channel must be an uncultured person. This movie is from Argentina, not Brazil, and everyone knows that. In what part of the movie can you see  someone speaking in portuguese? So thumbs down for the vid and a denunce for this channel.<br>Seriusly, this is like saying that the Eiffel tower is located in Greece, or that the river Thames is in Burma.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitauhg, america. this is argentina, not brazil.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil ? WTF. It&#39;s from Argentina
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThis is an Argentine movie,just Saying...
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaMy favourite story was the man with an ungrateful wife and the tow-trucks constantly at him! His reaction would&#39;ve been mine for suureeee!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshita<b>BRAZIL!?! FUCKING JERK. ARGENTINA!!!</b><br><b>ARGENTINA GODDAMN</b>
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBuen√≠sima cinta la acabo de ver   Ojal√° en <br>Hollywood  hicieran algo al menos un poco parecido.

Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaArgentina!!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThis is not Brazilian. We DO NOT speak spanish in Brazil. Cheez, when are you Americans gonna learn that
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaPlease Sountrack!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThat last tale was pretty fucked up. What a crazy wedding. Excellent film.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaI LOVED this movie so much. I nearly fell off my chair from laughter during that road rage scene.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaWe smart<br>We loyal<br>We friendly<br>We&#39;re from Brazil.<br><br><br><br>Brazil is such a great country that Argentine = Brazil<br>Kappa
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaI highly recommend this movie
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitathis was an absolutely BRILLIANT movie
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrilliant movie!!! Just watch it.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil? JAJAJAJAJAJA que imB√©cil dir√≠a Carla Lucero..
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaOne of the greatest movies
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil?
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite foreign movies of 2014 especially &quot;Leviathan&quot;.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaIf you like The Twilight Zone, Tales From The Crypt and shows like that then check this one out for sure. Six short, dark, well written stories. One of them in particular made me laugh for an entire 20 minutes. 5 stars.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBest !!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil?üòë
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitathe hungarian rapsody?????
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitawhat??? it&#39;s an Argentine film. Not Brazil. ARGENTINA, for God sake. correct that. The actors don&#39;t even speak portuguese
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThe Movie is from ARGENTINA asshole!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaSUBLIME!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaGuys I watched this movie and it&#39;s the best, trust me. It&#39;s funny, sad and really really interesting at the same time. I have never watched the movie like this one, and I recommend you to watch it!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshita¬øQu√©? Brasil!! jajajaja
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil??
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaGreat movie. Watch it now... Six tales <br><br>fuckk
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaI love the ending of the last story. So sweet! MAKE-UP SEX lol.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaPeruana? seguro lo es!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitathis is a good movie,but really not a Funny movie,i don&#39;t feel want to laugh.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaGreat movie!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaClaro, porque en Brasil hablan espa√±ol, muy l√≥gico...
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaAwesome movie! Don¬¥t miss this.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaf*ck. hate movies where you have to read everything. 1.5/5
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThe movie has a great sense of the absurd and how close we tread to it every day.¬†It kind of makes me wonder at the Argentine mindset. I mean how many other countries would invade a British territory with no real value besides national pride? (The Falklands).
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best movies that I&#39;ve seen in the last ten years, maybe ever. And I&#39;m 52. Funny as hell in a dark way and poignant as well. I don&#39;t speak Spanish, so English speakers shouldn&#39;t let the subtitles scare them off.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaEs de Argentina
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaOf all the countries you could&#39;ve mistaken, you pick Brazil for an Argentina&#39;s movie, some men just want to watch the world burn.<br><br>Jokes aside, the movie is amazing, i&#39;m brazilian, and apparently the Argentinian cinema is way ahead of ours.
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitathis movie is unbelievable 
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaquiero verla, pero el cine mas cercano a mi casa esta a 50 millas, valdr√° la pena!?
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaAll bellow comments honor this excellent argentinean movie, all comments are very good representation of it and of us jajaja. i laught with the reactions as with the movie!! We are all bombita Jajajja
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaARGENTINAA
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaArgentina stupid!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this movie from Argentina?
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s an Argentinian movie not Brazilian..  
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaWTF???!!!! BRAZIL???!!!! IT¬¥S FROM ARGENTINA!!!!!
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaEs sabido, obvio en Argentina, por encuestas hecha por corresponsales en la calle al comun del pueblo estadounidense, que en su incultura mas alla de &quot;saberse&quot; potencia dominante y cabeza de un imperio mundial, poco conocen al mundo que &quot;controlan&quot; y han llegado a responder que mi pais La Republica Argentina, es la capital de Brasil. Pensar que en la escuela primaria me tuve que estudiar capitales, rios, monta√±as, tipo de climas de todos los continentes...mas que un error pareciera que esto esta hecho a drede, pero bueh, asi estamos...pensando en la pelicula, en &quot;bombita&quot; vio, jajaja
Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaBrazil? TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

Utq0aDEp084delimeterByIshitaWild Tales Official Trailer 1 (2014) - Oscar-Nominated Brazil (?) Anthology HD<br><br>The movie is from Argentina.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaKatherine H complained about this movie apparently saying in was insulting to women, but personally I think it went both ways . It made the men look like goofs too . But in saying that, as a woman,  I <b>love</b>  this movie!!  . Its one of my top 10 faves . Theres so much energy in this . The acting is awesome . The characters are all adorable in their own way.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s be realistic: The only way a guy like that gets a woman like her is in a Hollywood romcom or perhaps if he&#39;s rolling in money. An out-of-shape average guy with an average job has no chance in hell. Not even with a scopolamine-spiked mojito.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI liked a lot this movie !!
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaAll my favourite actors and actress though
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv01Mcdf8rI&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a> I didn&#39;t know James Charles was in this movie
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitawhYY is Martin Starr not included in the trailer
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaRIP Harold Ramis <br>RIP Katherine Heigel&#39;s career
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not called knocked up when the people are in there late 20&#39;s, its just called getting pregnant. Teenagers get knocked up not adults.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaevery movie seth rogen is in is always FCKED up its hillarious ,just watched this is the end with Franco and Jonah Hill. Legend.. wait for it...... ary. Lgendary
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaDont mix shrooms and chairs.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI could only HOPE to get Katherine Heigl knocked up. <br><br>But for the life of me, I do not understand why every other starring male actor is in the description, except for her name.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaUninterested.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaAnybody here from David dobrik?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaOh fetus Iris...
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitagreat film
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaThat jewish never makes me laugh
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaRarely do men ever stay
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaNo...no way unless it&#39;s in a movie.  The guy is funny, but he&#39;s out of shape and not very good looking.  Apatow kind of likes to put ugly guys together with great looking women.  Hey, it&#39;s Nerds day at an Apatow film.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathis movie is indeed sexist and stupid
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s fat and ugly and worst of all, a loser. Of course a successful (and good looking) woman wouldn&#39;t have him
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaseth rogen overrated.<br><br>his jokes just plain stupid.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaGuys I like rom-coms like Friends with Benefits. Can you write below some movies like this plz???
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitadr ken in da house
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaLast good role and film Katherine Heigl played.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitan
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M a huge fan of Seth rogen he&#39;s the Bomb Diggity
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathis movie made me more repulsed about the idea of marrying...i hate girls like these..so full of themselves so high on their horses so worthless and shitty and ridiculous...not real not fun just boring stupid shitty...this movie made me hate these shallow women more than ever..why can&#39;t all girls be humble, deep, fun, lil more submissive and give up their feminist ugly worthless characteristics that makes them basically shit? oh well guess that won&#39;t happen coz that stupid triggered bitch reading my comment won&#39;t accept it even though it&#39;s real and it&#39;s shoved up her ass
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitawhy does that actress whats-her-name plays &quot;the lead role&#39;s sister&quot; in every movie she&#39;s in?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitawhy does that actress whats-her-name plays &quot;the lead role&#39;s sister&quot; in every movie she&#39;s in?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathis was one of them trailers where i just pause and go watch the movie already before something in that spoils the fun for me haha
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaclassic movie
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitai hate it so much musa is gay
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI remember when this movie came out.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaThis was the movie I found Jay cute tbh
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitanot the best 7.5/10
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaplan b?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitais it funny?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaWhy are Paul Rudd and Lesley Mann always a couples in these movies? :p
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaso that&#39;s what happened to izzie stevens after she left seattle grace
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathe girl -i am pregnant<br>the guy -with a baby <br>lollll
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaOh fuck me seth rogan is so damn sexy gosh come to me
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaWu Tang Clan - Shame on a Nigga<br>36 Chambers 4 ever
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaLets be honest guys....... there is no way a girl like her would go out with a guy like that
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitawhy is senor chang delivering babies???
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshita&quot;I should not have gone in there&quot; hahahahahaha!! That face!
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI laugh my ass off at all these comedy snobs, you are the worst kind of people.. taking comedy seriously.¬†
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaSong at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv01Mcdf8rI&amp;t=00m16s">00:16</a> ?
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathey gave it all away
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaThat dude at the end looks like an American version of Sam Pepperüò≥
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaI found it to be a mind numbingly bullshit boring movie. No intelligent comedy just crude for crudes sake, most of the characters are not likeable and felt fake. She would never get with Seth Rogan in a club (ok maybe if she met him when she was completely drunk but she is sober when they meet). This was shit but I thought &quot;This is 40&quot; was even worse so maybe I just hate Apatow movies.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitathe only bad seth rogen movie.....not his fault thogh.....the dumb bitch ruined it......
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaOMG that baby at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv01Mcdf8rI&amp;t=1m34s">1:34</a> looks just like J.K. Simmons!
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaokay im so confused ¬†saw this is 40 first and what does this movie tell about ths is 40 like i dont understand
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaKen jeong O_O
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitai get so stressed up with this movie. I heard a lot of that F*** word and all but then, it put smile on me in the end, like a real smile. It was very a nice movie. Love it! ¬†
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitai spy ken jeong
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaOMG Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill! i need to see this movie.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitahahaahaha i really must see this movie

cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie actually looks good.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaThis must be an ironic comment, I hope it is.
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaHow come you make a love story and don&#39;t end it with a real passionate kiss? In the end I was just staring at my laptop to see the last kiss, but it didn&#39;t happen. Motherfuckers, you make a real nice story and you don&#39;t show the love part at the end? Go fuck yourshelves..
cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitaDo tell.

cv01Mcdf8rIdelimeterByIshitayes,  a great movie you all need to watch.okay.

QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshita&quot;you are looking at that all the time yeah, you have eyes on it the whole time...&quot;<br>&quot;yes chef&quot;<br>&quot;look at me.&quot;<br>I thought when she turned her face, she would enter a world of pain
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshita&quot;Bradley Cooper plays a man unable to stop throwing stuff&quot;
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaSo when does he become the Orioles CF?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaBut, he forgot about jennifer lawrence, there is no bradley cooper movie without her.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitagood looking guy and knows how to cook? oh yummy I want one please
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThe stress, pressure and adrenaline you feel when you&#39;re cooking ¬†for hundreds of people in just 2 hours of a maybe 10 hour daily work. The chef getting mad, yelling and throwing plates around !! You will feel delusional sometimes but it makes you feel alive. A+
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaSo, he can only make movies with Sienna Miller and JLaw now? Ugh...
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaAmerican Sniper 2: Chef Edition
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaLooks like ok role for sienna
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaSo Bradley Cooper is an Academy award winner but not Leo Dicaprio. well done Merica!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaSo Bradley Cooper is an Academy award winner but not Leo Dicaprio. well done Merica!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitawhen is somone going to shoot¬† G O R D O N the movie lol
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThat looks awful. Like, really, why in the name of Christ, Moses and Mohammed did they think that wasn&#39;t a shit idea? It&#39;s gonna make that guff Rocket Raccoon made about being an author look like The Godfather II.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaBurnt:Boring.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitayeah~~ Kitchen Confidential is back!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaNo Jennifer Lawrence?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWaiting for actually good comments, as I can&#39;t figure out one myself :c
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaOmar Sy?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaI wanna see a biopic of Marco Pierre!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaI want to watch this now, I just can&#39;t wait!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaDoes he kill children and women in this movie too?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m eating taco bell while watching this.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWhat happened with Jamie Dornan?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaIf Bradley Cooper is in it then I&#39;m going to watch it üëåüòÅ
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaBradly is Gordon?? (plot twist)
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaYes Chef!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaso a bitter live action ratatouille?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThere is going to be a shit load of broken plates at the end of this movie
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaok<br>..now am goin to cook some shit,cause I eat what I cook myself only:)p
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaCooper: What are you!?<br>chef: An idiot sandwich
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThat moment he starts talking, and you immediately notice very good acting... just sayin
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaanother movie making something heroic out of something completely ordinary
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaA French (the black guy we saw in Jurassik World) who happens to be a commis (junior cook) in a movie about a restaurant in Britain with an American Chef ... nothing wrong at all ^^
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitahim and sienna miller again?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know, man.. I loved the movie &quot;Chef&quot; because it&#39;s fun and heart-warming and I&#39;m not sure if I want to watch another chef movie that&#39;s so serious and intense. I&#39;m going to watch it though, but I don&#39;t know if I would like it.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaOscar Bait
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaAnd then he had a brilliant idea for a T.V. show, and he called it &quot;Hell&#39;s Kitchen&quot;.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaBradley Coopee should fire his agent. He&#39;s a talented actor who plays in clich√©d generic crap mostly
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitathe last scene &#39;&#39;Yes chef ...yeah!! look at me...&#39;&#39; its Gordan Ramsay written all over!! looking forward for this movie!!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaDamn, seems everyone wants that Oscar‚Ä¶ Leonardo, Del Toro and Cooper to name a few
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert <br>He gets a restaurant
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitamaster chef hardcore
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaI was cringing too much to laugh.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshita&quot;If you try to open a new restaurant at least a dozen people will try to have you killed&quot;, am I the only one who burst out laughing? Leave it to Hollywood to try and make a movie about cooking a suspenseful thriller by using a bunch of edgy buzzwords in the trailer with dramatic music/undertones. Absolutely hilarious, poor Bradley Cooper, he deserves better.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaBooooring!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitacant be better than cooking master boy
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThe Great British Bake Off on crack.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaA movie with Bradley - it&#39;s always good.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the lamb sauce?!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitabollocks
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThe REAL Ratatouille
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaThink of Whiplash, in the eyes of J.K. Simmons and a little bit more milder. Thats this movie.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWow there&#39;s so much Oscar bait this year.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitawhere is Jennifer Lawrence??
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitalol noooooo
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaintense.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitahe`s talking like he`s crying
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaPlease go on my channel and check out my short film and tell me what you think this the first short film I&#39;ve ever made and would really appreciate the criticism
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWait a movie with Bradley Cooper without Jennifer Lawrence!?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaYooo I&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer for too long. FINALLY
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S ROTTEN!!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaso he left school when he was 16 to Paris so it is clearly set in France but he looks 35 and still speaks with a fluent American accent and no one in this trailer has a French accent and there was even a woman with an English accent
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaShokugeki No Suma
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaMeanwhile, I&#39;m satisfied going down to the local for parma and beer.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaPossibly going to be good?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitawtf is he doing in France? the best restaurant in the world is in Denmark...
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitawhat about Jamie dornan I heard that he was joined to this movie
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S F*CKING RAW!!!!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaGordon Ramsay : Thats my boy.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitagorden ramsey over here
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaCooking with the kock: De Movie
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaLooks good. Brad&#39;s a solid actor. I wish he&#39;d stop repeatedly working with all the same lead actresses though. Pair him up with someone more challenging, maybe not so girly and perfect all the time. I want to see him acting chops grow!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaHopefully this movie redeems him from that forgettable movie Aloha
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaLooking forward to watching that! Super chief! Looks good!
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitashokugeki! :P
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaOMAR SY!

QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t Bradley Cooper already do something similar to this movie but in TV version many years back? Kitchen Confidential?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaJamie Dornan is on the movie?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaim hungry now.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaWow I can&#39;t wait to not see this.
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsyzkkI_g14&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> - i wish all girls would think that way. sorry :D
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaApparently Leonardo is not the only one desperate for an Oscar...
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitaAnybody else eating when they watched this?
QsyzkkI_g14delimeterByIshitacook me a dinner please and don&#39;t be a drama queen :)

pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song in the background from 0:00 - 0:28?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaone actor is an American who is famous for doing characters with English accent...and the other is an Englishman who is famous for doing characters with an American accent
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaGood, we are having a recession, so, it the future isn&#39;t really shining bright.

Not blaming you.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaCheck out my channel for a nice live recording of Otis Taylor&#39;s &#39;Ten Million Slaves&#39;
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song playing at 1:16?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawhere is flavor flave
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitathis movie needed to be shot on film and not digitally. Im really sad michael mann jumped ships after Heat
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI do that too LOL 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaCan somebody tell me why those cars and outfits are some damn cool?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThe amount of bad ass-ery in this movie is outrageous! 

pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitadamn nice suits.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@LittleZ90 On one hand it&#39;s really weird that they filmed it that way... on the other hand it&#39;s interesting how it makes it easier to relate to that time period when watching it.. kinda snatches you from modern time and combines it with back then.. 

Not sure if that makes sense, I&#39;m but not really sure how to explain it.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie spoiled by HD cinematography... Less detail would have made it more enjoyable
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaLoved this movie
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@sugejr06 Especially in suits, now thats classic.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@joniwone A good one, unlike baby face nelson, count me in!!!!!!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@joniwone Yea this generation blows far as gangsta movies like public enemies..I would ride with John Dillinger all day lol
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@UnderGroundNaples89 No doubt
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@joniwone Hey I&#39;m with you all the way
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@sugejr06 I agree with you, especially with the thompson guns
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThis makes you wanna be an Outlaw...love this movie and i have it on Blu-Ray
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitathe trailer makes this movie to be something totally better...i saw it and was dissapointed... slow and dull script. no exploration of character or melvin purvis&#39;s role.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@barcodeproductions11  it&#39;s by Otis Taylor and it&#39;s called &quot;Ten Million Slaves&quot; 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@KarthXLR i agree.. but The HD ruined this movie for me. it was like watching people dress up and act in a play. 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaHow does such an awesome trailer exist for such a mediocre movie? Makes you wonder.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaAm I the only person that thinks this movie was terrible? Flat script and characters, bad cinematography the only thing that was good were the action scenes and the acting and both of those were slightly above mediocre at best. Serioslu just watch the movie dillinger from the 70&#39;s, its so much better 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@barcodeproductions11 otis taylor - ten million slaves
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawhat is the song at 1:16?

pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThe ending is so tragic! I ‚ô• you Johnny!!!!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaAmazing story, amazing people, amazing movie, amazing actors..

And a amazing trailer! :D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@SamDillinger1 Blow Wind Blow by The Rairbirds. That particular part is about 2-3 minutes into the song.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaLMAO@I have absolutely nothing I wanna do in Indiana
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaA story, about a time where hero&#39;s were forgotten. A story, about a brilliant and fascinating man. And when it&#39;s portraited by the greatest, most carasmatic, and most talented actor of our time, it&#39;s simply a perfect movie..

Personally, i love &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson :D In this movie, too! 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@biglebowski123 Well, I never intended on watching this movie anyway, so I decided to check out the trailer.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita@CainmosniMirrored then why did you watch this video? it says public enemies trailer, not public enemies the movie you idiot. 
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitafUCK Yeah
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThey basically just told us the entire plot of the movie and showed us the best parts in this trailer. Now I don&#39;t need to watch it. I prefer to know nothing at all about a film before I watch it. Trailers always spoil  the movie.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitathis movie was amazing
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaAwsome movie!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaso many fucking spammers,
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the song on the first 26seconds of this vid?can we find it here on youtube?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI honestly have to say this is one of my favorite movies because of the cinematography, soundtrack, and performances and the fact it has Michael Mann&#39;s style of directing involved. I am sure this will be a cult favorite in time, this has happened with most of Michael Mann&#39;s films. Take Heat for example, similar to Public Enemies, it was only a moderate success when it was released but now it is held to a much higher regard than it was in previous years.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita100% perfect movie, cant wait till it hits blu ray
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the first song on the vid? :D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitadude ur taste in movies suck, this was a really bad movie, never should of been made
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitafuck all u bitchs, this movie blew a herpies infested dick
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaIt was a pretty good movie. Marion Cotillard is so damn cute! Well, of course same goes to Depp.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaworst movie of the year
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitadont
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp is my hero!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaBEST-FILM-OF-THE-YEAR
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitadoes anyone know when this is coming out to dvd???
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaGood old Johnny!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaActually, John Dillinger only ever killed one person and it was a cop who happened to be at the wrong place and the wrong time.

Now Baby Face Nelson, That&#39;s a whole different story!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaMann and Johnny... Nothing can go wrong with that! And of course Bale is good too.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitatrash
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sure this is going to be a good one. Johnny Depp is my fav actor :D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitathis looks like a great movie
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaNo, not Black and White but FILM, color film is just richer and better than HD video for this type of a movie Teenage comedy ok, shoot Video, rich history FILM!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitabonnie &amp; clyde??
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaMilwauke 261 on 1:45

pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaOHH...THIS IS MY MOVIE...GREAT
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaJEAAAAAAHHHH!!!!! :D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is ACTION PACKED! Johnny Depp did a good job for this movie. I can&#39;t wait for it to come out on dvd
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI saw this. I really liked it. :D

Johnny Depp was a freaking hot villain, and the action and guns were off the hook.
:)

oh yeaaahh.
Go watch it.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitajohny depp so different here than at pirates of carribean
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaCan anybody please tell me the song they play at 1:21  !!!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI have to admit that&#39;s kind of true. Not for every single one of his movies, but a good part of most of them it&#39;s minimal facial expression.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawell he&#39;s always playing some character who never shows emotion.  never smiles.  never changes expression.  Also in 3:10 to yuma and the FBI agent.  The only thing that changes is accent.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitalooks sick. im seein it tonight
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita&quot;Mr. Dillinger,  why do you rob banks?&quot;

&quot;Cause thats where people put money...&quot;
-John Dillinger
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaCan you please to go a forum or something with your spoiler comments? I have read like 3 comments so far telling me what happened!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaHe shot himself accidentally while trying to clear a jammed tracer bullet.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI luv this film
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI saw it yesterday ... the movie was really good :)
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshita2 &amp; 1/2 hours, it was a really good movie, but not for the movie theater, i would say wait until it comes out on dvd and enjoy it at home. and don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s really good acting, depp steals the show (once again) and C. Bale has a limited part, they could place anyone else in his place and it wouldn&#39;t make the movie better or worst cause his character is kind of secondary
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaPatrick Bateman and Batman? How do you figure?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitait actually was homosexual
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who hates Christian Bale?  He plays only one character.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaI want to see it but I have been sick. On the web the reviews are not that good.  I think people are just envious of Depp&#39;s talent.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaWhat was it that you didn&#39;t like about Public Enemies?  I have not seen it yet but am looking forward to it.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaDonnie Brasco is ten times better.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie was amazing. Johnny Depp does a terrific job as John Dillinger. MIchael Mann has made yet another masterpiece. It might not be the movie for some people, but if you enjoy Depp doing what he does best and a lot of action, you will like this movie. It does have serious moments of conversating, but its great. Bank jobs, prison breaks, tommyguns and Depp being one bad mofo. Gotta love it!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitai think this is one of just a few movies where johnny depp is not wearing make up ... finally a chance to see his beautiful face
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaAmazing movie &lt;3 John Dillinger is the shit :D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThank you so much!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me the song at 1:15 and  1:57? I think it&#39;s fantastic :)
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitayes there are dirty scenes! lmao. they have sex on his bed! and you even see in the trailer how she&#39;s in the bath
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitadepp is stunning and his performance in this was amazing. he&#39;s a fantastic actor :) i loved this movie! can&#39;t wait until it comes out on dvd.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitatrust me mate this movie is the best fuckin movie of this year
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitawhat the fuck you think the movie sucked well if u think that u dont no what a good movie is dont forget its a ture story mate u wouldnt even serived back then in thos times
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie was EXCELLENT!! &amp; The Cast was TOP NOTCH!!
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitayou have to understand who john dillinger was to really appreciate this movie. Michael Mann did an absolute brilliant job. For those of you who think this sucked, im sorry you have poor taste in movies.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaFFS I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE ;D
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaThis movie was  bad. I am a Johnny Depp fan, but this movie is bad.
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaanybody know the song at the end?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaReally?
pv0DMzFwEW4delimeterByIshitaJohnny Depp!!! XD
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaThis is a silly movie‚Äî very overwrought. Surprising to see Viggo Mortensen Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl here, but I suppose they were drawn by Cronenberg‚Ä¶ who is clearly off his game. The main problem is the script‚Äî it‚Äôs like a bad cartoon.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshita√áa lui va pas de jouer le r√¥le d&#39;un mafieux russe...il a pas la gueule de l&#39;emploi. Il est fran√ßais le gars
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaOne of those movies that still hv an effect on me after all these years without rewatching it.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaThe suspense is intense the feel look is intriguing
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaMost finest movie i ever seen Viggo Mortensen hypnotized me with his actions, acting and specially his seductive voice
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaIs good, no
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaHow come it shows up on my phone but ive never seen it ,bro
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaESTE VIGO MARTENSE ES UN HOMBRE BELLISIMO Y EXCELENTE ACTOR, ME ENCANTA ESE PELO RUBIO Y ESA ROPA NEGRA, MARAVILLOZO!
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaMesserine was a great movie too
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaStupid fucking movie
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaYou know you&#39;re a top notch actor if Cronenberg works with you.

ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaamerican film where some man say &#39;Novokuznetsk&#39; (so rarely in american films)
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaVincent Cassel est dans un de ses meilleures r√¥les
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaAlso watch Payback 2021 film about 90s Russian mafia in US
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaI hate trailers like these they show way to much and portrays the film like it‚Äôs an action thriller but in reality it‚Äôs so much greater then that.

ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaTrailer flashes too much
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely a must see.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaViggo Mortensen looks like Michael Fassbender here.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaGreat film I wish I could see more similar to this.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaSimply outstanding . As good as any crime film ever made.  Hugely underrated by everyone apart from those that have seen it.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaFocus Features:<br><br>Thank you very much!
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaGreat, classic movie. Not for everyone though. It&#39;s quite graphic.
ifilHp3_dWQdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie but why a new trailer for this?
5X2aYYDlVSUdelimeterByIshitaHave she survived?
5X2aYYDlVSUdelimeterByIshitaThe last 10 minutes were very emotional. That poor girl, i just wanted to hug her. I don&#39;t know how you can love a child all this time then reject her so quickly. He should have fought for her
5X2aYYDlVSUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie But very sad at the end
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaAlmost 10yrs!

BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie in my opinion it&#39;s better than the Herald and Kumar trilogy because it actually shows the consequences for marijuana addiction meanwhile the Harold and Kumar films just to make marijuana look good and funny instead of showing the consequences.
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the title of the song in the trailer?
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaaddicted to love

BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was a trip. Why don&#39;t they make a sequel?
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaso.. this is the worst movie ever - super predictable, lousy wannabe jokes, very bad acting, and throughout whole movie you just wait for something interesting to happen. I didn&#39;t laugh even once, probably because movie is made for super stoned people who can be on that certain level to find this funny and amusing.... I want 2 hours of my life back.
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaWats the song guyzzz???
BWZt4v6b1hIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the funniest movies ever!!!

Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshita.
Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshitaWhere can i watch this?
Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally my favorite movie ever and I am absolutely proud of it.
Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshitaYes this movie can be really cheesy, however, it&#39;s one of the best modern movies about being an awkward teen and exploring sex for the first time. Plus Dylan&#39;s beautiful face doesn&#39;t hurt
Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshitaDylanüëèIsüëèHotüëè
Pa5963ftpDcdelimeterByIshitahahahah
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that 2016 is 7 years apart üòÆ
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaYou know when Morgan freeman is in a movie you know the movie is gonna be good!!‚ù§Ô∏è
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a movie!! But ending was not like what I wanted
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaSo he did what was right according the law...But was it right what he did....
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaHe is lame for calling the cops on Morgan freeman

Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaIt‚Äôs a very, very good done movie! Bravo Ben Affleck!
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaVery much like  Madeleine Mcanns  story
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaStill my favorite movie Ben Affleck has directed.
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaIf you guys liked this movie check out Manchester By The Sea
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaGood movie
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is about HAARP
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie hit me in ways I&#39;ve never been hit before ü•∫üòû
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitamy review will be strictly based on movie.  People may disagree with me but I decided to watch such movie thinking to have a great typical good ending which I definitely wanted, instead the ending ruined the entire movie for me. I want to repeat a very nice statement from the movie, &quot;people, they don&#39;t change&quot;.
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThis is the way to make a movie trailer. Create 100 questions without an answer. That makes you want to see the film.
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie.....it&#39;s really a mystery drama.
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitanice osm movi
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaA real masterpiece üòòüòò
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaMagnifique film !!! Le suspens jusqu&#39;√† la fin et le jeu des acteurs sublime !
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitathis looks bad. Is this trailer accurately representative ?
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôm from Boston, and I hate when actors try and do our accents. Affleck does it well. He is a Boston boy after all‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThe movie great because Ben Affleck directed it<br><br>The one scene give away what happened. Where the lady said are you shure
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaHow? How can one brother be so much more handsome than the other? ü§î I&#39;M PERPLEXED! I do not know. Casey Affleck, who has an unfortunate abbreviation is so much more handsome than his other brother Ben. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Tragic">#Tragic</a> really. üëÄ‚òï
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaAfter seeing this movie 11 years later,  the conclusion that a child should stay with a woman that birthed her versus a woman that can be a mother, is flawed.<br><br>I would have turned around and walked away and let the child have a good life. The way her mum was going, her career goals would be limited to bartender and prostitute
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThis was a FANTASTIC movie!!!  Great story, well cast, well acted.  I give it 9 out of 10 stars.
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaI Love Casey Affleck! Really good actor and I wish he did more movies!
Wzh4Q88sthYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie should have been nominated as best picture.

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaI found this because Sandra B said she likes a good penis. I love the internet.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaLooks juvenile. Not sure why two A-listers would appear in this. The dumbing down of America continues. 
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here cuz of spoken reasons

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaI too am looking for the first comment, I like the Ulthea person a lot.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaDay 14: Most of the crew has given up. They do not believe we can find the source of this argument. I still think we can find the first comment; the spark that set all these replies. Lets us all hope to god we can find it before we all go crazy searching

And for the record, I was actually being playful in half of my comments, especially when I saw you were a big cuddly friendly looking fella. I understand this is hard to convey in a written comment, but you really should work on not taking everything so seriously.


1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&quot; most pointlessly rude people&quot;

You must be new here. It would be a lie to say that you have the worst double standard I have encountered on the net, but you certainly are up there.

Pointless? Only if you don&#39;t see the irony of bagging sexism on the one channel while being subscribed to sexism on another.

My first comment was rather polite, you have not exactly been a pleasure to deal with. It&#39;s funny when people write arrogant comments then whine when they get a response.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re one of the most pointlessly rude people I&#39;ve ever encountered.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaLMAO 1:21 !!!! it&#39;s d from its always sunny in Philadelphia 
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaWell no, I copy and pasted your comment which happened to be exactly the same as mine. But it was yours nonetheless. Stick to moving your eyes independently, you&#39;re at least good at that. This debate thing? Not so much.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaNo, what&#39;s hilarious is that you just replied to one of your own quotes from earlier in this conversation.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita(comment # 2)

&quot;over-exaggerating the significance of that quote and trying to make it political, and I find that a bit silly.&quot;

Awww, you got caught being a hypocrite and don&#39;t know what to say...how cute! I was just pointing out that you say one thing while supporting a contradiction of that thing. Its hilarious.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaEach to their own, but you seem to be over-exaggerating the significance of that quote and trying to make it political, and I find that a bit silly.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita(comment # 3)

(his comments) Are the reason I find it amusing that you are so &quot;butt-hurt&quot; over this movie. You&#39;re not just having a simple &quot;I don&#39;t like this sorta crap&quot; opinion, you made it much greater than that. 
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita(comment # 2)

&quot;Watch his &quot;1984 vs. 2013&quot; video; see if you still think that.&quot;

Just like &quot;God&quot;, I don&#39;t care if he has done good, he has been a dick many times in the past. Comments like &quot;Rape isn&#39;t fatal. So imagine my indignation when I saw a chatroom called &quot;Rape Survivors.&quot; Is this supposed to impress me? Someone fucked you when you didn&#39;t want to be fucked and you&#39;re amazed that you survived? Unless he used a chainsaw instead of his dick, what&#39;s the big deal? .&quot;


1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&gt;a fact which Hollywood uses to garner a laugh from their audiences

Yes. A cheap laugh that relies on overused gender stereotypes. I think it&#39;s lazy, mean and unfunny. 

&gt;and I understand that each person has different tastes.

Right. So why can&#39;t you just ignore mine?

&gt;TAA - one of the most arrogant and rude fuck-tards

Watch his &quot;1984 vs. 2013&quot; video; see if you still think that.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita(comment # 2)



&quot;Why does my opinion make you want to talk me out of it? &quot;

Not trying to talk you out of it, just letting you know that your logic is unsound, and you are behaving here in a simple-minded way. Now go wash that sand out of your vagina....oh-oh, I used stereo-typical humour...I&#39;ll go apologize to the women of Africa who do have sand in their vaginas.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&quot;I got your point. ...&quot;

No, you didn&#39;t. I was simply stating a fact which Hollywood uses to garner a laugh from their audiences, your response was way off.

&quot;Why do so many people..?&quot;

Because it&#39;s a fucking movie. I don&#39;t entirely like Family guy humour but I don&#39;t throw a hissy fit about it existing, and I understand that each person has different tastes. And coming from someone who likes TAA - one of the most arrogant and rude fuck-tards on the net? Hilarious.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaOMG  that guy he is funny
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&gt;Way to miss the point.

I got your point. And I thought it was shallow.

&gt;Of course, there is always some idiot who likes to take offence.

What I can&#39;t understand is *your* motive. Why do so many people leap to the defense of lazy, mean-spirited, stereotype-filled comedy? I saw people do this with all the Transformers films. Why does my opinion make you want to talk me out of it? If you love the movie so much, go see it. It&#39;s not a person whose feelings will be hurt by my dislike of it.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaThank you for continuing a pattern I&#39;ve noticed time and time again: No one who uses the term &#39;butthurt&#39; unironically ever has anything intelligent to say.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&quot;And that&#39;s why there&#39;s never any protests against female circumcision in Africa? &quot;

Way to miss the point. 

&quot;Because I don&#39;t think sexual violence against men is funny, and too many movies/shows use it for a cheap laugh.&quot;

Did your wife beat you? Look I don&#39;t support violence against anyone, but this movie is not meant to be instructional or serious. Of course, there is always some idiot who likes to take offence. Why did you even watch this trailer, snowflake?
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaits a joke stop being so butt hurt 
btw he said Women are not stereotypically attached to their bits like a man is not that a women is not attached to their bits 
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&gt;Women are not stereotypically attached to their bits like a man is

And that&#39;s why there&#39;s never any protests against female circumcision in Africa? (sarcasm)

&gt;but you seem to be over-exaggerating the significance of that scene and trying to make it political, and I find that a bit silly.

So?

&gt;but why make it a sexism thing?

Because I don&#39;t think sexual violence against men is funny, and too many movies/shows use it for a cheap laugh.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaYeah, i saw the video too.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaWith two law enforcement officers like this (in each country), all our problems will be gone, gone, gone. jar
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaCon dos oficiales de la ley como estas (en cada pa√≠s), todos, todos, absolutamente todos nuestros problemas desaparecer√≠an. jar
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaHey Fox!

You know the clip you gave TheAmazingAtheist? The one where a lady cop threatens a suspect by holding a gun to his penis? Would that scene be funny if it was a male cop threatening to blow a woman&#39;s pussy to smithereens for being uncooperative? No? Well, I don&#39;t find it funny either.

It doesn&#39;t make me wanna picket the film&#39;s opening or write protest letters. But it does make me want to never see the film. Also, it&#39;s not funny. Sandra Bullock especially.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitahe&#39;d been acting years before that video . He just uploaded that as an extra video on his channel @spokenreasonstv

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita*clink* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaFUCK OUT THE WAYYYYYY!!!!!
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t supposed to comment here, but i just wanted to send a shoutout to my Homie, Spoken Reasons! Haiti Stand Up!

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaFound it! &quot;Bad Girls&quot; by M.I.A.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaWhat song is that? I can&#39;t seem to find it :\
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaIn the movie &quot;Identity Thief&quot; also with Melissa McCarthy, the same song plays in this trailer in the beginning of the movie.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaIm just here because i was searching for Will Smiths double decker movie set trailer, which is also nicknamed, the heat
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitacongrats on the movie spoken reasons!!!!! Can&#39;ta wait to see it!!¬®
these episodes are great was well, keep them coming!!!
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaI saw an advanced screening of this last night... It is SOOOO funny, GO SEE IT! In theaters June 28th! :)
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitalmao this is gonna be a big hit movie 

1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaHahaaaa!!! Can&#39;t wait to see this! So glad I was told to look this up!
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaWhen is her (not Sandra) 15 minutes up?!?!?!
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitai hate this
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitai hate this
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitamest up i hate this
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitamest up i hate this
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaHollywood is going to be all over him now because having a movie under his belt shows he is willing to continually show up on time and follow instructions.  It&#39;s a big transition going from director- always calling the shots to always being obedient.  That&#39;s probably one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest concerns hiring Youtube stars.
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshita&quot;I&#39;m going to bend you over, reach up into your pocket, get the keys to your house, and stab you with your own badge.....that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do.&quot;
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaLove both of these actress. Would love to see this film


1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaSpoken Reasons! 
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaAwesome
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitamelissa mcCarthy, seriously?
1O3iRdiplB0delimeterByIshitaLooks funny
DtD9Gqy79vEdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the music piece at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtD9Gqy79vE&amp;t=0m55s">0:55</a>?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI cannot wait to see this.. bummed I can&#39;t go see it right now.. Aug 8th for us in Columbus Ohio..  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boyhoodmovie">#boyhoodmovie</a> ¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is super confucing if you get in the half of the movie 
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita12 years boiled down to 2 hours. I wonder how they all felt at the end. 
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaTracy Vanity<br>While, yes, I totally agree with you that there should be WAY WAY WAY less white washing in Hollywood, this isn&#39;t the place to do it! Plus, there are other problems... example, the absolute lack of female-based film this summer, and near absence of good, smart female-based film. While I love Boyhood, and the Way Way Way Back,¬† (one of my favourite films) I think that I&#39;ve seen one too many white teenage boy coming-of-age films. Upon that, (wow I&#39;m making the sub sandwich of comments) the absolute lack of mental challenges is present in Hollywood, save for the stereotypes. So in summation: you&#39;ve got the right idea. But there are even more (better) places to say it then a good film trailer&#39;s youtube comment page.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaFake!!!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaAgain to Tracy vanity. African Americans have taken over Basketball, Football, have their own networks, Hispanics have their own magazines, channels and everything else that African Americans enjoy. What else can we do for everyone else before people stop talking about inequality. And by the way I&#39;m Hispanic. Time to go whine about what I&#39;m not receiving!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaHe may just be the most gorgeous boy I have ever laid eyes on. Especially that smile at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oX0xiwOv8&amp;t=1m18s">1:18</a>. I&#39;m swooning. 
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaTo the Idiot Tracy Vanity. Have you seen a Tyler Perry movie lately? Or anything thats Latham, or how about BET..Or maybe Jet Magazine or Ebony, or King.. All Black!! You wan&#39;t equality only when it plays to your advantage..
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaSimply AMAZING! :)
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaSaw this movie earlier today!! Watching it felt like watching a masterpiece unfold before your eyes! Best film I have seen in quite a while!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaTracy Morgan¬† Tracy Vanity¬† tracy i do not know how to respond to you??? how does it work? white [priovaleg? maybe? but guess what!!! mila kunis is hispanic. u know what else? if were on that topic of that 70s show. yeah? ever seen it? fez. thats all i gotrta say. also, where are teh whites in bollywoo. where are the whites??? HOW ABOUT SOME CUBAS IN ASIAN FILMS. none. so stop it tracy. tyler perry? you heard it here first. my friend natalie is from cuba and the anary isaldsna and she has a black step father. u dont hear her complsin. you know why? tyler perry. thats all i gotta say.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/Y0oX0xiwOv8?t=0m45s">0:45</a> Minute Maid Park in Houston!!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWho cares that this was filmed over 12 years?¬† Does that matter?¬† Does that make it better?¬† Whats the point?¬† This trailer doesn&#39;t look any different from any &quot;other&quot; film.¬† Whats so special?¬† Congrats, you filmed this kid over 12 years.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaTracy Vanity, you are such a clown. Part of being American is being able to have the free will to make any movie you want to make. With that said it seems that this director wanted to make a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; movie about a white family. If I do say so myself it looks like a pretty damn good movie. If you would like to change this. Go to film school, get funding and make your own movie. Dummy!! 
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaIf you like the idea for this film then you should check out the UP Series.¬† It is a a documentary filmed every 7 years.¬† It started in the 60s with a group of 7 year olds in Britain of varying races and backgrounds and films them every 7 years.¬† The last film in the series was called 56 Up!¬† It is a great series and it is amazing to see how their lives evolve. The first in the series, Seven Up, is on Netflix streaming.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawhich song is this ?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWhat an amazing movie! Check out my review on my channel!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWait, wait, wait!!!¬† Something original?¬† No.¬† No, no, no. Please get some Hollywood producer to mess it up please.¬† :)
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaTracy Vanity didn&#39;t 12 Years A Slave just win 3 Oscars ? To say that people of color do not receive enough recognition in this day in age is insane because they do. This is just one movie out of hundreds which have multi racial casts , also don&#39;t judge the movie if you haven&#39;t seen it yet , it might actually be very good.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWOW THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE SO GUD HOORAY!11 YAY
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWow, they censored the word &quot;drinking&quot; from the international trailer? Come on US, this is how you cripple the advancement of social and cultural maturity.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaDid he say &quot;welcome to the suck&quot;?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaAMAZING, I HOPE IT WINS EVERYTHING.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaCant wait to see it
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitadisregard the 12 years filming idea, and this will still be a great film because of its story and Linklater&#39;s storytelling
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaOne of a kind for sure! Love it.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThey have had quality like this in 2002 and haven&#39;t said a word? What the fuck? Answer that. Answer the question, &quot;what the fuck?&quot;
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaBeen reading up on this one and super excited for it for almost a year now. ¬†Just found out it won&#39;t be showing anywhere near me on it&#39;s release tomorrow. ¬†Super bummed. ¬†:(
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWhat does it do to someone&#39;s life to be recorded in this way? I don&#39;t know whether Linklater should be praised or condemned for this.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Could this be the next &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWOW
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis director brought us Dazed and Confused. Can&#39;t wait!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis one is definitely on my Must See list!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWhite people in white America doing white things. ¬† More at 11.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI need to see this already! Looks brilliant! :D
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawhy is it rated R? I was an extra in this movie so hopefully when I see I will get to see myself. I was wondering when this was coming out
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawelcome to the suck LOL
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitagenius
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawhere can i watch the film though
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis better win every award out there
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve just seen the movie. I highly recommend it! You should probably do not watch it with your kids, if you haven&#39;t had &quot;the talk&quot; with them yet, but still, a very awesome movie. Full of laughters, sad emotions and heartwarming moments.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definetely going to watch it as I&#39;m a fan of Patricia for years. I&#39;m really looking forward to! :-)
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitasounded like the movie that Herbert The Pervert would pay to see, just kidding. ¬†I bet the movie would be O.K. to watch, but it&#39;s TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Looooonnnnnnggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitamusic?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI personally know Ellar Coltrane ;) went to school with him and everything. Such an awesome guy! I hope this limelight doesn&#39;t change him haha
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawow can&#39;t wait. As a future filmmaker, i&#39;m so glad there are still directors that are not afraid to try something new. The chemistry between the actors must be incredible, I can&#39;t even imagine.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaOjal√° est√© bien sustentada y no sea el tiempo el que tenga el rol principal.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaMUSIC???
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaSo very excited for this film. Looks beautifully done!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita12 years??? how much salary are they getting?? XD
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaBut Americans do not make film of Ukraine or Syria...
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaAt the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oX0xiwOv8&amp;t=0m40s">0:40</a> mark---that classroom was in Kramer Hall at Concordia University Texas&#39; original campus. ¬†I have fond memories of the fire extinguisher in the hallway. ¬†I sat with a girl on the floor under that fire extinguisher as we were waiting for our next classes. ¬†I asked her out one day, and now she&#39;s my wife.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaIm actually and extra in this movie So excited its finally coming out!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis looks really interesting. The song choice for the trailer is great too. Hero by Family of the Year is one of my favorite songs.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWow this movie was started when I was 12 years old. Life has changed so much for me, I can&#39;t wait to see how life changes in 12 years for this actor.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI can not wait for this movie!! Ahhh!!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitathis looks sad !
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the guy in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oX0xiwOv8&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a>-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oX0xiwOv8&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a> ???
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitait&#39;s amazing how they used the same cast for the past 12 years i&#39;d watch this movie
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI honestly feel bad for this kid.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this! 
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitathis looks boooooooring
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is more powerful than 90% of the movies I&#39;ve seen. Glad I didn&#39;t hear about this movie until last year otherwise I would&#39;ve been driving myself crazy waiting for it!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitawho can tell me the name of the song
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWhen is this opening in the UK? I am already a little teary-eyed.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI just can&#39;t wait to watch this, this is amazing!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita„Åù„Çå„Åß„ÅÑ„Å§ÂΩº„Å´ÔºàÊú¨ÂΩì„ÅÆÔºâÊíÆÂΩ±„ÇÇÁµÇ„Çè„Å£„Åü„Çà„Å®Êïô„Åà„Çã„ÅÆÔºü
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThat seems like a real tear jerker
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaSo in 2002, was 1080p even around?¬† So the quality of the film is going to look crap in the beginning of the movie and gradually get better.¬† That‚Äôs annoying/distracting.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaKidBehindACamera bright me here!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitait was either genius casting or incredibly lucky that he actually grew up to look like ethan and patricia..
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the name of the song?¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaso.... basically the trueman show?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaBegins in 240p<br>Ends in 4k.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing :3
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaCe film √† l&#39;air tout simplement incroyable, vraiment h√¢te de le d√©couvrir. Je pense qu&#39;il est d√©j√† un s√©rieux candidat aux Oscars 2015 ( voir m√™me le futur vainqueur ? )
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI want to see this so bad
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThis is coming out July 11, 2014, and I want to see it so bad.  I hope it will receive and win numerous Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, and Original Screenplay.  I love Richard Linklater, and I want to him to finally win an Oscar.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThe song is &#39;Hero&#39; by &#39;Family of the Year&#39;. Thank you Shazam!¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWow. All the Oscars. Every Oscar. Jesus. Just take my money already, WHEN IS THIS COMING OUT?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWell the Harry Potter saga dealt with the quite same concept.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie in cinema&#39;s history is coming.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaUn concept hors du commun, h√¢te de sa sortie!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshita√âpoustouflant j&#39;ai h√¢te !
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI saw it at SXSW. It&#39;s almost impossible to describe. It&#39;s beautiful and funny and moving. This kid becomes your kid and he also becomes you, growing up. Linklater is incapable of dishonesty, of being contrived. He is the most underrated great American auteur.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaGiven the length of the shooting, telling a lot about the involvement of the crew and actors, and the theme (the simplest, the most demanding), that damn movie has better be a masterpiece.¬†
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaI wonder if other filmmakers will follow Linkater&#39;s footsteps in making a timelapse movie like this?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitadirected by richard linklater who did dazed and confused, waking life and many other greats...this is a must see for me
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaIs it a movie about a movie or something?  Just seems like a regular coming of ave movie..
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitathis guy is soooooo hooot <b>_</b>
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaFinally a coming of age movie by one of the best directors who happens to be the same from the best teenager film ever. Plus, the movie is incredibly done.
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaIncredible. Breath-taking idea!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitagood idea!!!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaLooks like they put so much effort making this movie, but I don&#39;t like teen movies about boys So I don&#39;t know what to think
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this!! Have heard about it for awhile now and it is finally being released!! :)
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitasong is Hero by Family of the Year
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaWho does that song?
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitafinally someone did this movie. i always had this concept from seeing movies where people grow up and they just re-cast another person looking nothing like their younger self. so i thought, why dont they make a movie with the same actor for lots of years, that could be interesting. just never really knew about what. guess this is one of those &quot;oh man, wish i couldve patented that idea before him&quot; just like with many other products/stuff. Looks great btw!
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaLinklater deserves an Academy Award Nomination for this...
Y0oX0xiwOv8delimeterByIshitaThat trailer was chilling.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitabuul shit  the make a THIS MOVIE KOMERSIAL  STUPIT KEIRA KNIGHTLEY 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaTwo Steps from hell ftw :P
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI just want to watch this because it has Jude Law. :D
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaOh come on, Aaron johnson? Why the mustache ... ugh.. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaKeira Knightley in a period dress, the world is right again.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m terribly sorry, but the appearance of this Vronsky  provokes associations with smth of a swain or a ploughboy, with his sweet curly hair &amp; so on...Judging by this trailer, Nothing in his sickly-sweet appearance (even humourous) ,  eyes &amp; personality would make a woman to commit such a Step....(IMHO))  &quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot;   V. Lanovoi was better &amp; probably Jude Law himself in his youth  &amp; even nowadays (remembering him in &quot;Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;) would fit  better...Sorry for my English ;) 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitawell if they were speaking English they would have British accents, anybody in Europe learns British English. And it is possible to overcome their first accent, Russian, if they were taught at an early age. But im just being nit picky.

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never understood why accent is so important. If it&#39;s meant to be authentic, then actors should speak Russian. If the film is in English, then what&#39;s wrong with an English accent?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve red the novel in frensh and i&#39;m sooooooooo happy they mad it as a movie with Keira as Anna i&#39;m soooo happy OMG i can&#39;t believe it, it&#39;s a dream come true :&#39;(
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitashe&#39;s the best actress of all times, what a talent she has !
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshita@Sunnysuite Exactly!!!!!!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaAs
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaThe thing is that the Russian nobility and rich people very rarely spoke Russian, instead most of them preferred to communicate with each other in French, English or German. Russian was seen as the language of the commoners until the fall of the Russian Empire. Even the last Tsar, Nicholas II, wrote most of his memoirs in English.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re right. I thought he was wrong because I was thinking Elizabeth Turner.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaor not...
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaactually i&#39;m a girl :) and i really liked her in the POTC 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI love her, I love her voice and way how she act, she has something special!!! And I&#39;m just a girl:)
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s an embarrassingly bad actress, it&#39;s like watching someone who&#39;s got a mirror in front of them the whole time. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaUmm.. wrong actress buddy. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaThis was so beautiful. It brought me to tears xP
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitathis could be soooo good to parody
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaHow long is this movie, because anyone who&#39;s read the book knows that the book is super long and the black and white movie was also very long...I hate when they remake classics(and especially ones based on books) like this and The Great Gatsby...well they might as well remake War and Peace and let her play the main female in that too.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitai prefer her as elizabeth swan
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaKeira Knightley is hot
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaBitch he is married to Keira Knightley, What else could HE want?!!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaSad generacije mogu da gledaju Keiru Knightley umesto da citaju knjigu :D

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitajust shut the fuck up you sound so stupid!!

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S BILL WEASLEY AT 1:32
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m excited to see this! It has a very surreal, Baz Luhrmann feel to it.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaLove these period movies! Totally want to see this!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaHa! Excellent!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitasorry.....but i aint white chica!!!! i am polynesian!!! sorry so i didnt kill any native americans!!!...those were the white people!!!....
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaPlenty of US born citizens don&#39;t have an ounce of British blood, and you&#39;re being just as cranky and ignorant as there person who posted before you. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaNeat interpretation, but I think I&#39;m still going to like the 1997 film much better than this one. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t be long and exhausting like the book.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaBook&#39;s author - Leo Tolstoy
Movie&#39;s director - Joe Wright
Protagonist - Keira Knighley
SO. EXCITED.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaits from the book by Leo Tolstoy

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaReading the book right now, not far in but I am enjoying it quite a bit despite how long it&#39;s seeming to be. However, while the movie may not fail to do justice to the book, I find that when reading (for me this is) being able to picture the characters makes it often easier.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitakick ass!! 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaits like the duchess all over again
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is nothing without Two Steps From Hell.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaah... fembot irrationality propaganda + revisionist history = shit. you go girl! you can have it all.  
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaOmg Two Steps From Hell&#39;s Nero is beautiful in this trailer.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry, but since when did Russians have British accents?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YOU HAHAHAHAH! DUDE omg.... now i dont need to watch it.. fuck this shit im out of here lol
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaA hundred-year-old spoiler. Daring.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to this movie and to Les Mis√©rables.  
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaMy jaw was open the entire time, amazing trailer !

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaThat awkward moment when Elizabeth Swann can&#39;t decide between Watson and Kick-Ass...
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitajoe wright aint american!! he british!!! so shut the hell up and if you really have something against america then dont go on the internet because that was made by americans!!! bitch
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaIs there going to be any badass epic fight scenes in this movie or what?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaAcademy Award for Best Costumes, check.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI took time to realize that was Aaron Johnson, OMG, Aaron and Jude in the same movie, this is perfection! 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaat least they all have the same british accent, 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitabetter to the Russian to remake this...
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaaaron johnson is so cute!!!!!

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaDammit Joe Wright. You and your historical romance films. Just take my money already.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI know they have to have some accent, and English appears to be the default one, but I do wish this was more Russian.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaWow. I hope nobody spoils the ending for me. 

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI love Dostoevsky. My comment was half tongue in cheek. Maybe you didn&#39;t get that. ;) Be nice.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaYou are wrong. Dostoevsky is pretty popular with the sofisticated musicians and actors. You just didn&#39;t get it.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaEveryone in the past had English accents. Didn&#39;t you know?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaLiterally one of the best trailers seen in a very long time. 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaDostoevsky is pretty popular with the average musician, comedian, and actor; Tolstoy is popular with the more intelligent musician, comedian, and actor. As long as America has it&#39;s subculture of depressed and starving artists, there will always be readers of Russian literature. I&#39;m sure most college writing courses cover them as well. All in all, I&#39;d say 1 out of 100 would be my estimate.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaAnother masterpiece from Joe Wright with Keira Knightley. I love them both so I can&#39;t wait!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI smell Oscar.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting. And I have a question. How many americans read Dostoevskiy and Tolstoy? I&#39;m often seen books of those authors in american mults and cinema.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaVery dramatoc. I love it. See what I did there
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaHow can someone cheat on Jude Law? Just askin..
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshita0:31...is that Matthew MacFadyen...Mr Darcy??
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gonna be a great film&gt;.&lt;
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaNot interested. I like Aaron Johnson though. Looking forward to seeing how far he goes in his career. Very talented actor.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitais this going to be free for schools ?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaGonna see this ! For sho&#39;
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaAARON JOHNSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON &lt;3
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait :) Keira is made for that kind of movies !

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaSuch a shame I watched the old film the other day and know the end. GOD DAMMIT. &gt;.&lt; x 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be as epic as Atonement and Pride and Prejudice. Joe Wright and Keira Knightley belong together!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaFinally,  another Joe Wright film!! I cant wait to watch this. Some of my favourite actors are in here: Kiera Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Jude Law, Aaron Johnson... CAN NOT WAIT!!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitacos they are all british?? this movie aint made by russians
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaI MUST WATCH
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitawhy they are not speaking Russian ??/ :-/
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaHahaha Kickass in this kind of movie, is very unexpected. Very mature actor.
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshita@dragonter  damn!!!! lol thanks for telling
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaAaron Johnson, i love you!!!!!!!! i wish you wasn&#39;t married, you&#39;re soooooo young
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaguess it shows he&#39;s got the talent to be a great actor... this seems to be a 180 from kick-ass
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitafrom kick-ass to this?
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitashe kills herself at the end 
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to see this master piece

Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshitaPoor Tolstoi to see his work so artificially done.... it makes me sad!!!
Z-nyXX5zOLgdelimeterByIshita1st ka sa kabobohan
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaIs it me or Headmistress Kirova is the hottest of all? 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait. Literally! Been waiting for this for years! This should have been turned into a movie way before Twilight... 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaMmmm.... i know that Rose and Dimitri have 7 years of difference but to me honestly he looks like the father. Btw im still waiting the movie !
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThe books are the most amazing thing ever and this movie is gonna bring it down 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think I&#39;d like this movie... Should I still give the books a chance?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaAaaaaaaaaaaaa soooo good damm. im so excited !
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaDirect all the fan-hatred towards me upon the mention of that one word: Twilight.¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaTypical Rose :) I cannot wait for this movie :D I have waited so long for this :D
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer confused me so much
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaA film for the tweens.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThat punch at the end though... You gotta love Rose Hathaway! Zoey is the Perfect Rose! I can&#39;t think of a single actress who could play Rose better than Zoey! She brings Rose&#39;s sassiness and pixiness to a whole new level! You simply can&#39;t help but love her! 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSo many people are not happy with the direction this movie is going. But I love it! Rose is very sarcastic and humorous and I think they captured her personality perfectly. 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThere were scenes that at first I was like this wasn&#39;t in the movie but after of analyzing them I remembered them can&#39;t wait for this movie 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI loved the books, but this doesn&#39;t seem like it will live up to them.....WHY DOES DIMITRI LOOK LIKE A THIN JACK BLACK!!!!!??????
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaguys, just face it, the book WILL always be better than the movie, I mean if everyone could just get that, we&#39;ll live in a better world. I&#39;m just really happy because the book deserves a movie adaptation. and btw the trailer looks pretty awesome, go rose!¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaVampire...¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t freaking wait! 
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like Mean girls not like Vampire Academy! What the f*ck?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSorry but what is this? I mean, the books are so awesome but this just looks like a B movie and it isn&#39;t like the books at all?<br>I&#39;m so confused now...
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaTHAT WAS SO ADORABLE
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWTF is this Shit?!<br>Ps: I don&#39;t care who read the book...
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaFirst trailer looked like a bad Vampire Diarys clone, this looks like Joss Wheadon helped write it(ik, hes got nothing to do with it), much better, i might eventually rent it now.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaGreat more vampire crap this time ripping off harry potter. WHOOPIE
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaPeople just read the book first.OK?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ERrnYunBg&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> I wanna watch this movie just because of DAT scene and DAT body
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI love rose is the books but in the movie she&#39;s better! can&#39;t wait until februari
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaLissa&#39;s fangs seem too fake...¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaomgi loved the book and this looks hilarious i love rose
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaAfter falling in love with the books years ago I immediately dismissed this movie upon viewing the teaser trailer, but now...this looks AMAZING, so happy they kept the humour from the books and Rose seems brilliant. Wish this trailer had more dimitri though, want to hear the accent ¬†:-P
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT! LOOKS SO GOOD!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaLove it. Cant stop watching it
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitadiscount ellen page
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThis is 10x better than the original trailer.  Smart dialogue, witty and likable female lead, funny situations.  Now this is a trailer of an overlooked concept done right.  I&#39;m very interested now.  Only problem is the lead sounds, looks and acts exactly like Ellen Page do her career may not blossom.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaZoey is just the perfect Rose. Dimtri is friggin sexy (and his accent SMEXXY).¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s got a Juno vibe about her.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshita*loved.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSo many people are mad that this is funny because they say its not supposed to be a comedy. But it&#39;s not. If they really read the books they would know rose Hathaway has a very sarcastic personality. I lived this trailer so much though.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I dont like the Lissa accent is because I listened to all 6 audiobooks and I love the narrators accent so t me that is the true accent, but i will deal with it.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSome jokes i didnt like some i loved definately gonna have to see this one like 10 times in the theater. Not liking Mias hair though &gt;.&gt;
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThank god! The official trailer is so much better than the teaser trailer. I can&#39;t wait for the movie to come out!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this!!!!! Absolutely hilarious!!!!!!!! That ending lol¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI really wanted to hate that trailer, but it looks actually pretty fun. might check it out :)
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaReally really .... Again this stupid movies of vampires really
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaOMG! I really think that this is going to turn out great! But am i the only one who expected Mia Rinaldi to have blonde wavy hair tip her jaw bone?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the music featured in the trailer?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaFinally I have waited for ages for the full trailer. Literally ran home from school to watch it. It looks so good
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWooowwww!!!!! Super excited for this movie! Looks great!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaYayy Sarah Hayland ^_^
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaFinally! A vampire movie that actually looks like fun. Might be a nice reprieve from all the angsty drama shit that takes itself way too seriously. I&#39;ll definitely be keeping an eye on this one.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaDimirti could be a little more attractive..... In my opinion
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s that girl?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshita <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LetsMakeTonightOurBitch">#LetsMakeTonightOurBitch</a> ¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitamatangiiiiii
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at the end called???
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaAhhh gin wigmore song in the background
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThis film can`t be taken seriously... :// thought that VA was a serious vampire book.¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaCAN&#39;T WAIT!!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSo, its basically a sexed-up Harry Potter.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSo its Buffy and Harry Potter combined..... Boring!!¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitathere are a lot scenes i don&#39;t remember in the book and a lot of &#39;em that AREN&#39;T in the book, but i still love this :D i&#39;m freaking out, can&#39;t wait till the movie comes out ^^
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitawhat is the name of the song?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think I wanna watch another vamp movie... ever.¬† Thanks Hollywood.¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWho directed it?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaToo girly.. I dont like it!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitastill better than twilight
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaIf you haven&#39;t read the books you should! They&#39;re amazing! And the movie looks so good! Wish it had more dimitri action it it though!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWHEN
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaTRAILER SONG: MATANGI BY M.I.A
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaLooks good I must admit the last trailer made it look too much like a chick romantic comedy. I&#39;ve read the first book and it looks pretty good. They made necessary tweaks and at least it doesn&#39;t look cheap as hell. I think I will like it regardless.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitawhats the song playing for the trailer?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY a movie about teenage vampires!¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWaow!! This looks very very Bad!!!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaToo Buffy-ish.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT AWESOME!!!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaVampires popular culture has to die..
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI have not read the original books, but this looks to have much more life and energy in it than Twilight, or any of its knockoffs. Let&#39;s just hope that they didn&#39;t put all of the legitimately funny scenes in the trailer.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaprobably not gonna see it in theaters but if it keeps the Buffy/Joss Whedon vibe from this trailer I might check it out when its out
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI really look forward to those fights in there! The book was awesome!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWow, even vampires party in colleges now? What has the world become?¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitawell, at least this looks fun.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaYes so seeing this. Haven&#39;t read the series but this has me sold.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaolga kurylenko u sexy bitch!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaOh my goodness the end!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaEspero que essa doen√ßa seja melhor que crep√∫sculo.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitathe actors are all wrong... and I sure hope they stay true to the books and don&#39;t make this another twilight thing. Because then we fans will rage HARD!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s that girl from Zach and Cody Suit Life on Deck
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaLiterally just watched it for the girls
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaoh another one...
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaSong at the end please?
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaVampire will be soon in the endangered list of species, cause: testicules cancer for the males...;
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitastill better than twilight
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is this shit?!¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaNot really into the whole Vamp thing, but just for the comedy and fight scenes this looks like a winner. Should be a fun distraction from everyday bullshit for a few hours if nothing else, LOL.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaROMITRI &lt;3
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaOMG I WAS SO ANGRY WITH THE TEASER TRAILER BUT THIS!!!!!!! I FING LOVE IT AND CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE ITS SO PERFECT AND RIGHT AND THIS IS COMING FROM A FANGIRL OF THE BOOKS WHO CRIED SO MANY TIMES READING IT :D I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s it rated bcuz I wanna see it! :.
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaYolo only yolo
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitanah to girlish¬†
E1ERrnYunBgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for the movie!!! Zoey Deutch is perfect as Rose, no doubt at that. And haters gonna hate, I&#39;ve been waiting for a movie adaptation of the book for years! :)

acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaTim Burton‚Äôs last great movie.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitathis was incredible! great music!  first time johnny ever sang and he nailed it.  should&#39;ve gotten the oscar.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaAnyone else get a Series of Unfortunate Events vibe from this trailer?
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaOk so now Bellatrix is with Griendelwald. Even wormtail abandoned voldy üòÇ
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaMy gusion
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this the altimate Tim Burton movie
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaThis is not a &quot;classic&quot; anyting.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaJesus Christ loves you and He died for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaSweeney Potter
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaThis was a horror movie. I always thought it was a dark comedy.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaGusion skin the hair stylist üî•üòä
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaHalf the damn Harry Potter cast: <br><br><br>Bellatrix Lestrange: Helena Boham-Carter <br><br>Alan Rickman: Severus Snape and<br><br>Whoever plays Pettigrew
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaFun fact: in this movie there is Johnny Depp who portrait adult Grindelwald and Jamie Campbell who portrait young Grindelwald in Harry Potter.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaI love how they framed it for at least the first minute as a non-musical movie lol.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHBq_oZm-8&amp;t=0m32s">0:32</a> I think this trailer is epic and for the most part is beautifully crafted BUUUT Ive never been a fan of this section, the music plays over ship footage and sounds like Pirates of the caribbean which is not an image you want to think about whilst seeing Johnny Depp in a different role.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaKind of misleading. The movie is better than the trailer. Were they afraid to advertise a musical?
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHBq_oZm-8&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> This trailer was epic and using the song Epiphany was a nice touch üé∂
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaThe man is the skin of gusion in MLBB elite skin hairstylist
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaI loveeeee this movie and i loveeeee Johnny
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaFor all the people out there who walked out of the cinema and complained that it was a music and never advertised as such- here you go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acHBq_oZm-8&amp;t=1m05s">1:05</a>
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaOn a trailer nostalgia trip. One of my all time favourites and damn  they just don&#39;t make trailers like this anymore. I miss it. <br><br>Also love this film and johnny. ‚ù§
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaGod designed our world so that everything would exist in perfect harmony. He made humankind in His image, so that we had the capacity to worship Him and walk with Him. Because God created you, He loves you. You exist to glorify Him in a real relationship.Mankind has rebelled against God, choosing to live for ourselves instead of for Him. This rebellion, called sin, has come between us and God. This sin brings about brokenness in our personal lives, our relationships, and also our world. Not only has it separated us from Him and His perfect design, it also brings judgment and death.Because God loves us, He sent His only son Jesus to rescue us from our sins. The Bible says that ‚ÄúGod shows his love for us in that while we were sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8). Jesus lived a perfect life, died on the cross as payment for our sins, was buried, and rose again from the dead. His resurrection proves that God has accepted Jesus‚Äô sacrifice for our sins. Believe in Him and go to Jesus in faith and trust in Him and trust in Him for salvation and repent of your sins and He will hear from Heaven and forgive you of your sins and save you from all sin and from death and from the enemy and from the wrath of God that&#39;s against sin. (Romans 5,6,7,8, John 3:16, 1 John 1:9). I&#39;ll be praying for you to come to know the true God of all and experience His true love and Holy Spirit and salvation and i pray you&#39;ll go to Him and get saved Amen in Jesus name
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaI recently acquired this on dvd, I have not seen the movie in almost 10 years
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaI just found this after seeing the nard dog from the office!
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaClassic Burton <br>This is what he was infamous for. I wish he‚Äôd go back to this, gothic horror is what he‚Äôs best at
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitalooks like peter is still working for snape...
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaI cried üò¢seeing this....So beautiful
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaThis was such a unique concept of a movie, I would&#39;ve loved to have seen Depp win best actor!
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaThis is a masterpiece
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaOh! I see Bellatrix Lestrange there! Okay, she is a good friend of Grindelwald, OH! and I spot Severus Snape, who is also a fake death eater, which makes him a fake friend of Bellatrix. And.... OH my! is that Peter Pettigrew!!!!<br>My Brain: Next Target, FIND THE REMAINING MEMEBERS FROM THE CAST OF HARRY POTTER!

acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaLol they forgot to mention it‚Äôs a musical
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaIs it just me or does this kinda remind me of Freaky Fred from Courage the cowardly dog?
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshita...And so,  Johnny Depp and Jamie campbell both came to play &quot;Gellert Grindelwald&quot; later in Harry Potter.  This might as well be a whole alternate universe of the Harry Potter casts.
acHBq_oZm-8delimeterByIshitaNobody:<br><br>Tim burton: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE ARE MORE ACTORS? I ONLY KNOW JHONNY DEPP AND MY OWN WIFE

yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThis game can be related to Far Cry 2 in many ways, where its set, the diamonds, the wars and missions.
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaBeautiful movie I
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThis movie motivates me to work hard it makes me think how hard people living overseas.
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThe trailer was pretty good but I feel that it did not do the movie any justice.<br>This was such a powerful, raw movie with minimal amount of Hollywood destruction and really changed my whole mind. Now, whenever I walk past a jewelry store or hear that someone got engaged and has the most beautiful diamond engagement ring, I don&#39;t feel giddy or excited about some rock deprived from the Earth. Too much suffering could be caused by the diamonds the US sells shamelessly in huge amounts of quantities. I just hope more people can watch this amazing film and realize what others must sacrifice for one store that makes up mere pieces of jewelry.
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitacool. . .
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshita?
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaAwesome trailer for an amazingly great film.

yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is really good
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThis movie blow my mind
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaApparently, mining for diamonds is very dangerous. People captured to go and mine for diamonds face the maiming of their limbs if they refuse. Blood diamonds indeed. This film looks incredible. I am unsure about Leonardo&#39;s accent, but I want to see it for Djimon.

yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaAnd I wanna meet Danny Archer :-) :-)
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaThis is the best movie I¬¥ve ever seen. Stays on the same level as LOTR (Avatar can be there as well), but in the same moment, Blood Diamond cannot be compared with those two, because of their cathegory. Well, the best and saddest reality I¬¥ve ever seen in any movie. 
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a very dangerous job. many journalists died in war&#39;s like Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia (when Russia invaded ) and many more modern wars.
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitasup meh brewww, lol the way he says it!!!
By far one of my favorite movies of all time.

If Someone asks you something, you listen. and even if that guy does have a problem with indians, what the ***** your problem- you cant stop swearing
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitai dont know what are u talking about idiot...  Is there something wrong with ur head...??  And whats your problem with Indians idiot.... ?
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitathe scene in the end when he is on the phone looking around him and touches the red sand(probably remembering what the colonel told him) was so fkin epic!! great movie,i rate it 10
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitathe most touching &amp; meaningful movie i ever seen... 
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitathe best movie
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaOk i will delete my comment...and what are you going to do?? i have an idea, you dont watch this film, coz i spoiled the movie.. ok??? 
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaoh sorry i don&#39;t know what is a trailer, and thank you for letting me know what is a  trailer... :P
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshita(People that havent watched this movie yet, don&#39;t read this comment).

Amal, I know the movie was release long time ago. But this is the trailer. Yous said in your comment that leonardo di caprio died in this movie. You shouldn&#39;t do that in a movie trailer! Cant you understand that? Would you like me to tell you that one of the main actors in a movie you were very excited to watch died in the end? No, you wouldnt. That&#39;s all im saying. That&#39;s why I got angry. You said he died!
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaNow about the movie, thats also funny, how did i spoil the end?? You know  this film is not released yesterday, it was 6 years ago on december 8, 2006. And i dont even remember how many times i watched.... May be i will post the plot of the film here... If i spoiled the film then you dont need to watch... ok..?? 
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaHaha that&#39;s really funny... I can post anything about the movie here, thats my right.I am not using my words against any other people.. So you should mind ur language when talking against strange people..ok??  

yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaexactly.... thank you...
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaNo, i am NOT an idiot. You are. Why did you have to say that about Leo in your comment? That&#39;s the only reason I got angry. You SPOILED the end of the film! You shouldn&#39;t do that in a movie TRAILER. Cause most of the people that come watch the trailer haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, so DONT TELL THE END...... as simple as that. If you want me to mind my language, you mind what you say in ur comments....
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaAgree with Guilherme,  &#39;cuz only a person with humidity in the head post a coment of the end of the movie in the TRAILER you understand what is TRAILER !?
yknIZsvQjG4delimeterByIshitaAre you an idiot or something..?? It is very shame that you didn&#39;t watched it yet.. And i dont want you too watch this film, ok..??? Don&#39;t watch it...And  mind your language....

-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaPretty sure this is the movie where she shows nudity 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshita<b>sees emma Watson in thumbnail</b><br><br><br><br><br><br>OHHHH MAHHHH GADDDDDD @‚Ä¢@
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI bet he dies at the end. Ethan is becoming the new Sean Bean.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaBoobs
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaSeems like True Detective: The Movie.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI have no idea what&#39;s going on, this is a proper trailer!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaAll i have to say is, meh...
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaare we just gonna ignore the fact that professor lupin, hermione, and some death eaters are all in the same movie again?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaSomeone Obliviated Hermoine!!!! and now she is having nightmares of Death Eaters.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEven though fans have watched her grow up since she was 11, they still consider Emma Watson as a sex icon...
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaand the most boring trailer ever made goes to..
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaHer name is hermione
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaseems like shit
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEmma&lt;3
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Hermione and Lupin
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaOBLIVIATE........
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaSeems interesting enough.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaHermione and Lupin in the same movie &lt;3
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThis makes me think about True Detective, in a good way
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaIs Ethan Hawke always attending in horror films? 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaShe sounds awful in this, I&#39;m sorry. Like she can&#39;t act, not credible at all. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the accent... What happened?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEmma watson is secretly the killer.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEMMA!!!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaLooks good. :-)
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaProfessor Lupin and Hermione Granger are there, but where is Harry?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaseems interesting, will definitely be expecting quite a bit for this movie xx
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitafinal destination 6????
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEmma Watson&#39;s Illuminati ties come to kill her! That&#39;s the truth people! #911<br>lol jkjk<br><br>Finally a recent horror movie that doesn&#39;t look cliche as hell, surprised to see a scary movie that looks decent and original out of hollywood, ever since we got all our m. night shamylans, rings, horror remakes, and torture porn out ¬†there&#39;s been a massive drought of good scary movies (as far as i know). Horror movie scene is lookin up!!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitalooks good!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaOk ok... Something decent looking and a true trailer for once,  not giving it all up n all :)!!!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaDeatheaters wont leave remus and hermione alone! But seriously I am soooo pumped for this
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s a detective called Bruce. Hmm....
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting but i hope it&#39;s not one of those things where someone is a schizo and its all in their heads
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaWho recognised the phrase &quot;Clear your mind&quot; from HP3 and HP5 (Lupin and Snape) :) ¬†that is so weird ^^
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEmma&#39;s American accent is brilliant üòÇ 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaOmg David Thewlis and Emma Watson!!!!!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaMinnesota reppin :)
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThe overbearing ominous music blaring in the movie is to keep you awake in this silly &quot;twist at the end&quot; film.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaAnything Emma puts her hand on becomes gold
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEthan Hawke could&#39;ve been a great Batman
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaWhy do I feel like this will be a plot twist in the end that he was the crazy one the whole time lol
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaFeels like lamer and urban version of true detective 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaAt least her accent is getting better js
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaTrue Detective: The Movie
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaKinda bored me
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThis looks rather interesting.<br><br>Emma Watson. Wow. Such a hot lady. :D
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaShud be gud... than the stupid comments ....
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitashitty trailer
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEmma (Hot)son üëçüòç
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is 60 seconds too long.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshita2 Theories: Main guy is hallucinating, or Emma did it and is messing with all of them.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEyes wide shut with Emma Watson
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaTrue detective rip off
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaBruce Kenner
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaNice to see Emma Watson back on the big screen &amp; showing just how good an actress she really is.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitalooks good... Emma Watson
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t it reported that this will be her first topless roll? Thats the only hype factor everything else looks pretty &quot;meh&quot;.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaInception 2: The Shining
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaAmazing trailer ! I want to see this movie :)
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaHermoine could play with my wand any time LOL
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaLooks so goodüòç
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaGotta love Emma Watson!
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m getting a Shutter Island vibe
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThe doctor is one of them
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaSo what I&#39;m taking away from this Ethan Hawke&#39;s character investigates a town of people who are linked to The Occult and they almost killed Emma Watson&#39;s character but failed and the whole town is in in this conspiracy who are trying to sacrifice her.Ôªø
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitathis movie looks so intense and scary..
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI thought the death eaters were finished?!?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaRemus Lupin + Hermine in one movie
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaJust use¬†Legilimency..
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaWow... Who Obliviated her forgot to give her a new accent along with her new personality.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaEXPECTO PATRONUM!<br><br>Seriously, this looks pretty good actually
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaWOW...MOST CLICH√â TRAILER EVER...
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaBet he dies at the end. Ethan is becoming the new Sean Bean.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaCopy + paste scrip parts of  the most generic movies of 2008 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t you mean Caitlyn Kenner?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand all the love for her I don&#39;t find her attractive at all
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaShutter Island?
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaCue the Harry Potter jokes.<br><br>But seriously Hermione, stop putting on that silly American accent, and be cute and English again. Pick up a wand and a cup of tea and all will be right with the world. Just, please.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaemma in a horror movie? since when...
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshita69th like brah
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaIf only Emma could uncover her repressed memories of being a witch.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaIs Watson supposed to be speaking in an Northerner accent? Stands out like a sore thumb. 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaHermione and Lupin!! Wooo
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaIm not expert but Emma Watson doesn&#39;t looks to be acting as well as she use to.
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m interested
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaFirst
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshita360p?  Really? 
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaThe accent :o
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitahahahaha
-pBwIsVGaL4delimeterByIshitaLol
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitahes cute
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaits like a combination of groundhog day, matrix, speed/unstoppable and a bunch of other awesome movies...... this is gonna be good
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitadeja vu,being john malkovich,timecrimes,lots of similarities, but seeing that the director&#39;s first film was Moon ,which i loved,i&#39;ll have to see it to decide,but i have high hopes for it to be good,trailers are almost always (no good,no good),misleading in some ways..can&#39;t wait
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaNice!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitai remember when i was a kid i have played that i am able to cross over another guy and decide on his destiny :D:D:D, just like in this film, :D:D:D 
i cant wait to see this film
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaI think she&#39;s the Bomber.. very obvious..
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaQuantum leap meets Deja Vu. I can&#39;t wait to see this. I think it looks really good. The director did Moon, which is in my top 5 favorite sci-fi movies list.
Glad to see he&#39;s back at it with another movie, that will be (hopefully), great.
Great casting job as well.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaJake Gyllenhaal, one of the bests!!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@DOOMSayaar I think TV could use another derivative of Quantum Leap...I thought it was gonna be Journeyman but sadly that didn&#39;t turn out well. 
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaWTF?! Quantum Leap?!?!?!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@zbrack same question just popped up in my mind.
i rememmmberrrr...ahm...a...movie...called....ahm....&quot;deja vu&quot;.
which is a deja vu in itself... neo? stop messing with us.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else think that she&#39;ll end up being the bomber...?
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@zbrack so bloody true :D
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaI love Jake Gyllenhaal! He is wonderful!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitafuckn rip off of Dejavu
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitajesus fuck..
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaDeja vu of Deja vu.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitathat chick looks happy 24/7
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitacool
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaInception code, expect to have another ending of thst sort
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaSo vantage point mix with unstopable
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaWHEN THIS IS OUTTT??!?!??!?!?!?!????
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@manuel8200 ,and for the other 7 minutes???knitting!!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaepic
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaNice...probably would make a better Television series though
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@KingOfTheBeyond23 And Primer. 
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@manuel8200 Golly, that&#39;s fabulously ambiguous. 
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t 1:37 from the last airbender?
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaseems like a damn stupid movie!!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@KingOfTheBeyond23 Woah bro, that&#39;s too many movies.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitawill be one hella movie!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitamy first impression: quantum leap, second: inception, third: must see this movie!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaDoesnt look bad, but we will see!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitareminds me with &quot;DE JAVU&quot; movie...
Have the same idea...
Change the past for a different future...
good movie..^^

NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaof ive gotta see this one!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaThis feels like a cross between Deja Vu and ... Inception. Kinda. Kinda looks a bit meh.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaugh, not feelin the concept of this move
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@nongo Kinda like inception ;P
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaalmost like &quot;phonebooth&quot; in the low budget, one-set-for-the-entire-movie concept. love the crazy physics shot of him jumping straight off a moving train though.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaEvery 10 years some douchebag remakes &quot;La Jet√©e&quot; and pretends nobody will notice. Well, I do.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@rencrow 
That&#39;s the thing I can&#39;t remember the basic premise seems vaguely familiar I think I read a Philip K. Dick story like this. I was hoping someone out there in cyberspace might know. It could seem like a Philip K. Dick story because his plots have been copied so many times that it could be similar without the filmmakers knowledge.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s gonna be AWESOME!
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitano :(
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshita@Moshgfx  no
:(
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitain the end they get stuck in limbo.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaI bet he dies in his world, saves the lady and create their own world.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaGroundhog&#39;s day + The Matrix + De Ja Vu = Source Code
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaDeja Vu with a white lead...
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaI just stopped after 0:48. Probably gonna watch it anyway X)
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaIs this based on a Philip K. Dick short story? I swear this is like a Philip K Dick short story I read.
NkTrG-gpIzEdelimeterByIshitaHey Leute seht euch mal dieses coole Video an

zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was fucking brilliant. Especially the music. Great homage to classic, violin heavy horror films
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI like how the black and red demon looks like, not how it sounds
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWas this movie scary , should I watch it .. Please suggest really horror movies ..
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaTrailer [-5/10] Movie [1000000/10]
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWhat movie is better? Insidious or Sinister?
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWatch Spy with Rose Byrne lmao
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so fuckin boring n unoriginal
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitain part 3 the same joker comes in the end of the movie and wants to kill the old lady üòê
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThis is a pretty good trailer for Star Wars Episode 1
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaOman tanrem
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitai see the movie and i am 10 years old
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitathw third one was great
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaLOL
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaman its not the part were everything thats scary is moving fast that scares me its were it moves fast then it goes really slow then pops out thats when it scares me
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, I thought this movie was terrible. It started pretty good, but then it got really stupid. I found myself laughing at the &quot;ghosts&quot;, as well as all throughout the &quot;spirit world&quot;. But what I hate the most, is that whole movie felt scripted by a child. Just the way all everyone acted made it feel dumb.<br>Sorry for the rant.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaAfter everyone was saying how scary it was, i must say i was disappointed, nothing scary
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitascary im ganna whatch it
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThere is nothing scaarier than an old woman in a gown and singing to his old song
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitainsidious is insidious is is insidious
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;re going to pretend there&#39;s nothing on the left side of the screen at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuZnRUcoWos&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> right?
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitawhat is it going to say.........insidious is......what
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaOne question: HOW THE HELL IS THIS PG-13!?
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaLooks a lot like poltergeist lol (original is better)
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve had scarier shits than this film, it&#39;s little things that screw it up like being shot by a shotgun and having a tiny blood mark like you were shot by a pistol. It&#39;s this kind of lack of attention to detail that makes this film stink of low budget there&#39;s much better films out there.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitathe ending ghost was so bad.......
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitahorror movie . <br>i love film joseph beshara demon very scary
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitavery goioid yes
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitakill me shit im dead if ill see this movie...   ):
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitai love cast this film
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitathis trailer is boss, i just wish i was man enough to watch it :(
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaKick the kid out and he&#39;ll be outsidious
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitathis movie was a scare but I will say that I was pissed off at the demons or whatever they were. <br><br>i pretended to be the father and thought to myself that I wouldn&#39;t let no bitch take my son away.<br><br>SPOILER<br><br>there is a scene where you scene that vampire looking bitch and I just wanted to punch and beat the shit out of him.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaits bare scary though I nearly shit my pants that&#39;s how scary it is
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI watched 1 &amp; 2 on Netflix but I&#39;m gonna watch 3 when it comes
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaTbh I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It&#39;s a very good movie and one of the best horror ones I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;m just sick and tired of stupid movies that claim to be horror when really they&#39;re nothing but crapy. Whereas this one was actually good, especially the ending was epic! I can&#39;t wait to see chapter 2 and 3!!! 
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitasomeone should kick the ghost out, then it would be outsidious,  get it, huh? No, no,   ok I&#39;ll get my coat.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this. It was scary as shit
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitafromage.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaBryne ‚ô°
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaDamn! They made all 3 insidious trailers scary as hell! Literally! 
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaInsidious is the best film 
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI drink and drive on purpose.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitathese movies are ... idk confusing?? so, this ghost REAPPEARS in chapter 3, ... so actully, chapter 3 is the first THEN chapter 2 then chapter 1 WTF
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWatch the Insidious series from this order 2nd 3rd then 1st!!!
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaBEST MOVIE I&#39;VE EVER SEEN!!
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaTrash. Comatose. I didn&#39;t have bottle of Coke had I had fallen asleep. Brazenly Poltergeist was remade without paying royalties. Disgusting.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaElise is the star of the movie for me
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThis is the only movie that has scared me haha conjuring , devil inside, all those shit ones are nothing to this 
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThe thumbnail is terrifying enough damn
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitatrailers are here to make it look better than it is
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaNo bitch. The last part didn&#39;t scare me u.u
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaDalton in a coma I know, I know... Insidious
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaI have seen this movie when I was 9-10 years old alone and it was to scary to see so I cut it in half the and couldn&#39;t sleep for weeks
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaIs it saying that insidious is everywhere!? I have to watch this one before i watch the third in theaters
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaInsidious is what?
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThat demon has a pretty shitty taste in music, that&#39;s scary indeed.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaWho else felt really sorry for the baby at <a href="http://youtu.be/zuZnRUcoWos?t=0m58s">0:58</a> - <a href="http://youtu.be/zuZnRUcoWos?t=0m59s">0:59</a>??:(:(

zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaToo scary to watch
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThe trailers for all 3 chapters of these movies are scarier than the actual films. And it disappoints me how people are saying this movie was better than Sinister. Yeah, right. If you&#39;re saying this is the scariest film you&#39;ve ever seen, than you&#39;ve never seen a true horror movie. I&#39;d rather watch Annabelle on loop than sit through this movie. And I tried. So bored I fell asleep.
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThe old lady is on insidious 3
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so good, and by the trailers of the other 2, it&#39;s a lot better than the sequels as well

zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThe one time a family is sensible enough to move out of the house.....the house wasn&#39;t the problem
zuZnRUcoWosdelimeterByIshitaThere is a better version of this movie with more scarier scares - The Conjuring*

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaSo, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, and I think I saw Jason Clarke in there for a split second. Throw in Shia Labeouf and Guy Pearce and you&#39;ve got Lawless 2!
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaSeems like a great cast and possibly interesting story wasted by fake Russian-infused accents.¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaYes, they have focused specifically, for a small fraction of humor, you&#39;re so everything is tightened!<br>Pleased that Tom and Naomi again in a movie.<br>Nice to see Fares of &quot;Kvinden i buret¬†&quot;
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaOriginal setting for a change. Good actors, good setting, nice cinematography (at least it looks nice in the trailer). Looks like a good movie.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAnother uplifting movie about child killers ! ....LOL.. luv ya Mr. Hardy
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitatom hardy movie must-see movie.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshita<br>S P O I L E R   A L E R T :<br><br>most comments below are about <br>those stupid russian accents
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaWhat a lovely lovely voice 
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaWonder how long Gary Oldman in this movie.¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAtleast they&#39;re using russian accents
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaread the book both an ¬†amazing and disturbing story¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy my favorite Actor. &lt;3
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaBane and Gordon are pretty far away from Gotham City....
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s so bad about the accents...? jeez get over it and enjoy the movie for what it is... a MOVIE. having the accents (bad or not) makes a movie set in a place other than America seem a tad more realistic. I&#39;d rather they had the accents than have Russians sound American
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaThis is what Snape did before he taught at Hogwarts.¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaPeople are getting so worked up about the accent, that they don‚Äôt even realize that the book is loosely based on an actual Soviet serial killer named Andrei Chikatilo (The Butcher of Rostov) who, between 1978 to 1990 murdered over 52 women and children. He confessed to 56 murders, tried for 53, and was sentenced to death for 52 back in April 1990, he died Feb. 14, 1994. He grotesquely mutilated his victims to an higher than that of John Wayne Gacy, but a little bit less the Jack the Ripper, so I would only assume the the film may or may not show the mangled body of a child. And no, I have not read the book that takes from these murders.¬†<br><br>Pretty much to give some background and M.O. on Chikatilo,¬†<br><br>Background:<br>-He was verbally and physically abused by his mother<br>-Chronic bed wetter<br>-Shy, but very smart kid who was bullied throughout his childhood and adolescence<br>-Suffered from chronic impotence<br>-social awkwardness and self-hatred<br>-Didn‚Äôt get into University, as his grades were seen not good enough<br>-ended a relationship after 18 months because he couldn‚Äôt get it up<br>-tried to kill himself<br>-was married in 1963, and has to kids, girl Lyudmila, 1965, and boy Yuri, 1969<br>-Became an ineffective teacher who was mocked by his students<br>-1973, assaulted two teenage girls on different accounts and nothing was done about it except for him to find a new job<br>-by 1981 he had several child molestation complaints against him from both sexes<br>-became a supply clerk which allowed him to travel¬†<br><br>M.O.<br>-For his first murder someone else actual ends up getting blamed and executed<br>-by the second he upgraded to attempted, with strangulation, and mutilation<br>-striation marks to the eye socket<br>-by the third murder he didn‚Äôt fight his urges, one victim he stabbed her 50x, ripped on her chest, and took out her bowel and uterus, she was 10.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitai agree with the accents but this looks like a damn good movie
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaVERRRY bad russian accent, hope there is russian synchronisation
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI had never been mad at a trailer before, but this...omg. I don&#39;t want to sound like the asshole who&#39;s read the book (although I do sound like it) but this looks like complete nonsense compared to the intelligence of the source material. Really hoping to get surprised because that didn&#39;t look good
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitalol no accent in AC unity -&gt;rage...accent in child 44 -&gt; rage
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for this. Looks amazing, big fan of Hardy. I&#39;m hard for hardy.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy!!! This guy can do no wrong! In Tom Hardy I trust 
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaHorrible horrible trailer
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI usually like these actors, but this looks terrible.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaFUN FACT: they are actually speaking russian, but u ddnt know that u understand Russian which is why it seems like they are actually speaking english since english is your native tongue. MIND=BLOWN

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaHow stupid is this accent?!!!
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaGood looking movie. The trailer&#39;s cut like shit with the lame as, quick cutting, strobe like effect and lots of text making sure we know this movie is produced by people who made other movies we like.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaLoved the book..hopefully the movie will be the same..
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAll this epic, Mass Effect like music puts and end to all of the drama for me. Music and picture do not suit each other or rather compliment each other
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaOldman can just use his accent he did for Reznov in COD.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaWOW infamous &#39;&#39;hollywood russian accent&#39;&#39; dialogs sounding laughable, russians don&#39;t speak english like that
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaPretty sure the accent is supposed to reflect that point in time not now. Accent is valid.  Relax
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitalooks great¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaIt is pretty they take Swedish actors to do these roles. We are not Russia!!!
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaChild44, Mad Max, and The Revenant.. Hardy is going to have a great 2015!

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAbout the Author Tom Smith, I know the cast is stunning, ¬†do not think that the film will attract attention . And yet intrigued by what they took off .It is a pity that no direct relation to the project has no Andrey Zvyagintsev .
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy... Too good
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaGrace Randolph¬†This looks cool. Basic trailer set up, but still.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaMaybe this is just me, but I prefer the at least try to put on an accent. At least then I feel more immersed in the story. I always found films that have Europeans that sound either sound American or British (that aren&#39;t suppose to be from Britain) takes me out of the experience. Sure, it could use work, but its a step in the right direction to eventually having actual Russians play Russians :P¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI really hope they don&#39;t ruin the book but why do I feel from this trailer that they have. Looks too actionay!¬†
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaViktor Reznov is that you?
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaIt is so stupid that they play russians, who speak English in Russia but with &quot;the russian accent&quot;. Why not speak normally? I just don&#39;t get the logic.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy sexxxy!

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAhh yess, but the child of Ra&#39;s al Ghul is Child 45
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaIs this 4 movies now that Tom and Gary worked together?
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaSo sad to see that so much people don&#39;t like this really awesome idea to make the movie characters speak with a russian accent. I&#39;m russian, by the way.¬†

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaCome on! Stop doing that stupid Russian accent in films about Russia. For the Russian it sounds silly, because Russian speaking English better. This is a stupid stereotype ¬†created by Bond movies.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad about having the chance to watch a synchronized version ... The movie looks pretty good but I can&#39;t understand that accent madness. There is no point in pretending to have an accent if all the acting/speaking characters are Russians
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t tell if I saw Gary Oldman in this trailer¬†or not.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaDamn this looks good. Dat Cast just elevates it even more. Hardy and Oldman. Sweet.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaHardy et Rapace again? I say YES :)
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaReally? British and French actors doing a Russian accent? I think the accent is unnecessary. If they make the movie in English you don&#39;t need the accents it just sounds dumb. If you want it in Russian accent well do it in Russian.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitagood one
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaI wana see it reminds me of The movie &quot;Prisoners&quot; 
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaThis accent is hilarious, i could not even concentrate on the trailer. Why? WHY? It&#39;s pretty clear that if it happened in Russia, they were speak Russian. But they speak English,  so why they trying to make movie with that horrible &quot;Russian&quot; accent? –£—à–ª–µ–ø–∫–∏ –±–µ—Å–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaWhy the hell ruin a potentially interesting film by forcing them to speak ridiculous accents!? Why!?? Are they worried we&#39;ll forget they are Russians...?

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAlthough I love Tom Hardy&#39;s work, this is totally unnecessary. Why not just hire russian actor.

In what was then a Communist state, the police investigations were hampered by bureaucracy, incompetence and those in power. The story is told from the viewpoint of the detective in charge of the case.

Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaTom Hardy best actor of all time.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s one of most stupid thing. Make film about russians and make this disgusting accent. Or speak russian with subtittle or speak normal (as it be in real life). Same shit russain do in ussr era with americans in soviet films. looks stupid and sound same.
Uia6y9SRsj4delimeterByIshitaAnother part Tom will nail...such a talent. Gary, Noomi, how can this ever fail?!

AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaJust imagine that a country staged a terror attack like 9/11 or 7/7, and blamed the attack on a nation that was completely innocent. Then they could invade the country and lands of the innocent nation that was blamed, and the gullible masses would all be onboard with the invasion. Now, imagine being the innocent peoples of that country being invaded, and what it must feel like, watching your family, friends and neighbors being shot and killed everyday. That gives you the full outlay of Hurt Locker.

AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaIf not lead but i searched Guy Pearce movies and this poped out in google and i said that this was a good movie but i hadn&#39;t watched it.<br>So i decided to see it and guess what,That guy is dead in first 5 minutes....really?<br>Wtf ü§¶üòÖ

AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThey‚Äôre U.S government troops until become avengers üòÇ
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaIf you google hurt locker it is GI slang for severe injury.  I think the movie hurt locker is really named after the locker under his bed where he kept the un-detonated ordinance or triggers that he found and disabled. All of the hurt that he saved others from.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThis truly explain the backstory of Falcon and Hawkeye.

AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaBest technical film ever
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaI think the eib and airborne badge on the black sargeant is worn wrong.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaAbout a week ago week ago üòã
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaPainful to see how he went from this sort of acting to the sideshow rubbish he does as Hawkeye. Not that his wallet will complain though.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaAfter saving private ryan this is another gem in the league.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a terrible joke.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaFor some reason I always confused this movie with Hancock
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaJEREMY RENNER is the real OSCAR WINNER
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThe dead bomb tech who Hawkeye replaced was the bad guy in Iron Man 3. They all been Marvelised.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThe absolute worst military movie ever made
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaI finally watched it. It&#39;s great!  It doesn&#39;t preach any politics or morals. It just tells the story
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThis winning Best Picture makes up for Saving Private Ryan losing
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitakindly send me movie link
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitawhen you realized Avengers know how to act.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaSergeant pepper from American Dad
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaHawkeye, Falcon, Wasp, and Aldrich Killian before they were in the MCU.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaLove Jeremy Renner
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitatrailers honestly give away too much of the movie. the first time i saw this i had seen zero trailers. the film got a very small release and was never released globally it sucks that trailers tend to give you a taste of what to watch if you were open to more movies that you had no idea about it would make them twice as good watching.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIbFvqFYRT4&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> Well <b>Bleep</b>
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaVery good film recomend to watch
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaThey should make a movie of the book called Discovery Mode by Joseph Tait Miller!

AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitaAfter watching this movie you realize that Jeremy Renner is one of the most under utilized and underrated actors in Hollywood. It&#39;s a shame, no place for real talent.
AIbFvqFYRT4delimeterByIshitavery good movie.

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaRyan Reynolds for PRESIDENT!! Damn he is soo fine!! LOL
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawow ummm... it still is kinda weird they didn&#39;t cast a black guy as the green lantern...
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@emeric190 lol no
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@emeric190  no that was another green lantern there is more than one human GL

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawait.....isnt that the same purple dude from the old Power Rangers movie? It is!!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@emeric190 aye but there wer two green lanterns, Hal Jordan = white guy John Steward = black guy :) 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t the green lantern a black guy ...in the comics..
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitais it just me, or is that guy way too skinny

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaHow wonderful.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks kinda retarded....
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI love it that they decided to use Parallax as the villain!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t  green lantern black
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThe cgi makes this kinda look like Alice in Wonder Land. lol
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaDC &gt; MARVEL
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else think the villain looks INCREDIBLY lame?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI beware the power of green lantern‚Äôs light.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI hope Warner Bros. make The Flash and Wonder Woman movies and eventually a Justice League movie... Maybe an Aquaman movie and some other DC superheroes ones too...
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaDC &gt; MARVEL
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@EmsionProductions the only thing that looks bad is the gun and his suit but only a little bit but who cares as long as the movies good.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@Cyrunix Each Lantern have different power constructs because of their background. Yea, green lantern 49 is a good issue with John Stewart. He&#39;s the only lantern that took down the entire black lanterns on xanshi by himself :)
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@EmsionProductions i agree too
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaWho needs John Stewart when we have a black Kilowog!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaMark Strong as Sinestro is brilliant casting
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaMy name is Ryan Reynolds too.. mm.. I feel like I can use that to my advantage to pull girls :3 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitano... too much 3D
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawhy cant danzel washington be te green lantern 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@Cyrunix that&#39;s only because the guardians changed the book of oa to make it so. This is before blackest night.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitalooks a bit better then the first trailer, but i still doesn&#39;t look all that good 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve heard Amanda Waller is in this movie... I liked her in Smallville, her and Checkmate... But seeing this trailer I think that she is that young and silly woman. Is that possible?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThe ring turns thought into reality...it&#39;s limits are only what you can imagine....
EPIC
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitayah im kinda pumped for this
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitatheyve certainly improved the cgi much more, looks like its going to be a really good movie, cant wait
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@unfolder4u Hal jordan in the comics used machine guns, and other lanterns... look at green lantern 49 blackest night

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitablake lively 8)

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaLooks too campy.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaOu it looks fricking amazing!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@NDF211Gunner Because that&#39;s where the creators wanted it to land. Don&#39;t question it!  And the ring allows anyone who wears it to speak the language of the native peoples.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaJIZZ IN MY PANTS!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaGreen lanterns can&#39;t use lethal force. IDK why they gave him a damned mini gun.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@grifonclaws Actually, all of you people forgot about Alan Scott. He was the original human Green Lantern because he was created in the Golden Age of Comics while Hal was drawn in the Silver Age. Hal was only the first human Green Lantern to join the Green Lantern Corps as Alan had never even heard of the corps throughout the course of his superhero career until he started having crossovers with his Silver Age counterpart. However, many people view Hal as the greatest of the human lanterns.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitagoing just for the chain gun
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitadid u know samuel jackson is playing john stewart? lol. if only that were true...
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@JediRobotKira  yup ^_^
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@randombajan wait nevermind, i didnt know you were counting alan scott
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@randombajan actually he was the 3rd, kyle came after john, its hal, guy, john, then kyle
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitasolid superheroes movie; great casting too....
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaehh
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good. Heavy reliance on visuals though. 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitahahaha he has no dick hahaha 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know much about Green Lanterns lore, but I think I&#39;m gonna have to start learning.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaohhh no... looks bad ass...
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@fazawood81  John Stewart was black but he came after all of this. The movie is focusing on Hal Jordon who came first once Green Lantern was rebooted into a sci fi rather then just a super hero comic. If you watch most cartoons or movies that involve GL you will see that Hal Jordon is the most used though I guess the confusion is understandable since John Stewart was the GL used in the JL cartoon series.   
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaHoly Shit!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@lordseshomaru86 the &quot;debate&quot; will never die, during the justice league a new frontier, first flight, and probably the new green lantern animated movie and series people have been like why isnt he black or I hate when they make people white
no matter what, people will be idiots, bottom line
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitathe gossip girl bitch&#39;s acting kinda ruined it
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaAwww man they covered up the pink girl :( And something&#39;s bothering me about the mask. It makes his eyes looks so small. Maybe widen the space for his eyes a bit? And make it a bit darker or something I don&#39;t know.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitanow THAT looks much better. 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaWait, why is deadpool wearing the green Lantern&#39;s clothes?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@lordseshomaru86 what happens to hal jordam?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaHopefully it look even better after they make the cgi even better.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitai would watch this! looks legit 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitabored!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitadamn michael clark duncan plays the weird pig lookin guy now thats wats up lol

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@fazawood81 you need to read the comics. the black green lantern was the fourth human one. the first three was white, and the fifth.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitathe green m13 minigun he has shoots really slow lol.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThe End few seconds literally gave me chills. 
Or it was the door being opened behind me. Either way, This movie looks awesome.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@fazawood81 im pretty sure the first human green lantern was white, then when he was dying the ring chose a black guy
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@fazawood81 yes there was a black green lantern, theres been many human lanterns black and white (think mostly white though but i didnt really read the comics much).
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitafinally a DC movie with action that isnt batman
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaummm....question....are those the SAME guardians that intervened with the fantastic four when battling Galactus? or do i just have my shit mixed up?

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawasnt the green lantern black?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitai like it but idk i think they could have done better.. idk too much animation... bummed
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaMAKE A GREEN ARROW CROSSOVER
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawill the recruiting thingy be in this movie? like the avengers.... this for the justice league

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaAndy!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@lordseshomaru86 you are 100% right and jon stewart is also in the movie according to imdb and theres a pic of the guy who plays him with ryan reynolds

7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitai got dumber after watching this..nice idea, could be transferred to the big screen more sophisticated but then again its a comic?
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t Green Lantern black? (not being racist)
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaOk much better, now I do want to go see it!..
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@adit365 that&#39;s what she said 
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitamess!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaYou know how to spot a green lantern know-it-all?
Just see if his/her comment is about the original Green Lantern being african american.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitalookz kind of lame
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaseems a little silly
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThe End Was Too Fast...
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI want see MOGO
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThis will be the biggest popcorn film of the summer.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI love it can,t wait to see it (:
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitathat looks good may wait for Blue-ray
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT. F&#39;IN AWESOME!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitawow jimmy newtron plays in this movie
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitahell ya
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@TheDude9596 How is this debate not squashed yet? John Stewart wasn&#39;t the first Green Lantern. His predecessor Hal Jordan is the one this movie follows as it should since this is an origin movie
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThe effects look kinda cheesy
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitatoo sik
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaThis doesn&#39;t look all that great to me.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaI guess Warner Bros. is really trying hard to make this worthless movie look interesting.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitakilowag speaks!!!!!!!!
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshita@Gnomy94CAFC Really? You have no clue what you&#39;re talking about.
7-GO9fo9DtMdelimeterByIshitaSweet :o
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit, only pathetic no life losers will go watch it.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLet&#39;s all watch this on skype together, who&#39;s in?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaStupid... but i must see it
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaSo am i the only one who actually wants to see it?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t they basically just reveal who the last girl standing is? Ridiculous. They need to take a page out of Gone Girl&#39;s marketing team&#39;s book. Though this is more lowbrow than the latter that&#39;s for sure.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaAll those well known social media alert sounds in the trailer are driving me crazy lol.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/Lgj4GjqCFlY?t=0m46s">0:46</a> go to the url shown on that site. <br>
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see this movie now<br>
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s what happens when you do that to someone you know, they come back to life and get you
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis seems reallyyy good
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWow what a piece of shit this is going to be. Fucking hell, do film makers have no shame?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis. Looks. SO ¬†good. Omg...
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWell it makes for an interesting movie I&#39;ll say that
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing O.O
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell is wrong with the director? This is just a bit to far in the horror genre.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking retarded
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE FUCK
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t really understand the concept. Why are they getting revenged on if Laura was the one who was drunk at the party. Her mistake first
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaAll this trailer did for me was make some random Skype sounds that made me check mine
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI feel like this is more of a psychological horror. Of course, this is extreme and wouldn&#39;t happen, but it&#39;s sort of teaching a lesson (at least I imagine it does). Teaching a lesson that doing that kinda stuff (posting the video, going along with the bullying) can hurt you very badly down the road, as well as the others around you.<br><br>Also, I imagine they aren&#39;t just logging off or anything because they feel trapped by whatever or whoever is threatening them. Obviously they&#39;re pretty skeptical of the guy until shit starts happening that they can&#39;t explain, unless it&#39;s some elaborate, sick prank. Also, it&#39;s kinda scary because I feel like &quot;billie&quot;&#39;s motive is to get the person to admit what they&#39;ve done, and until they do, they have to watch their friends crumble in front of them. The billie guy is going to torture them until he gets the answer he wants, and none of them are owning up to it. The people who try to leave or cheat whatever is supposed to be happening to them, I believe that&#39;s where we start seeing some deaths.<br><br>I&#39;m not the best at explaining my point but I hope this is understandable, and it seems like it has a lot of potential to be good!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get why other people are to blame for her death. People holding up their phones is a pretty good clue that her actions are being filmed. So you partied hard on film and you&#39;re being judged. Oh well, build a bridge, get over it and move the fuck on. Who gives a fuck what people say. ¬†Wah wah wah slut shaming wah wah wah cyber bulling wah wah wah suicide. Goddammit, what a bunch of pussies. I can&#39;t see the logic in this movie or society for that matter.¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaUm this was the whole movie in the damn trailer
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaOMG cant wait!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaIs it a true story? Anyone know?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaOmg I wanna see that so freaking bad
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AWESOME!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaOkay by why was someone videotaping her shooting herself in the face?<br><br>I mean I know it was liveleak but still, you see a girl pull out a gun and your first instinct is to start filming? ¬†Oh wait I guess they just already happened to be filming because everyone is always filming random stuff at high school, amirite?<br><br>Can the whole found footage/horror genre just die already? ¬†It&#39;s always so unbelievable save maybe the first Paranormal Activity that it completely destroys any immersion it&#39;s able to create in the first place. ¬†This looks like it could be fun but I&#39;m willing to bet it&#39;s going to be 100% jump scares, no actual atmosphere that lasts more than a minute, and a couple high school drama and love plots thrown in there. ¬†Don&#39;t even get me started on how this idea has already been done quite a few times..
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so excited to see this, I have to say the originality here is like no other movie I have ever seen. I cant wait, im sure this is going to win an academy award, really this will probably be the best horror movie yet.

Horror movies is coming to shit. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgj4GjqCFlY&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> this movie will be shit.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/Lgj4GjqCFlY?t=2m10s">2:10</a>, let&#39;s hope most of the movie won&#39;t be like that
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitamalia haha¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitamaybe they will make unsubscribed, its based on this video, its about me unsubscribing because of the huge cliffhangers
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitadid anyone else try to look for the &#39;LAURA BARNS KILL URSELF&#39; video AND THIS MOVIE LOOKS AMAZINF
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitai just deactiviated all my facebook, instagram, and twitter account just in case u know..¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaeh
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m 12 I Sure I need to see this
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLOL what the hell!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI wanna watch this movie, it looks interesting. 
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaOMG! WTF IS THIS?!?! SO CREEPY!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA Which group of degenerates came up with this shit?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshita–î–∞ –î–ê –∏ –µ—â—ë —Ä–∞–∑ –º–∞—Ç—å –µ–≥–æ –î–ê!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaModern day version of SAW
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitashe can do all this magic ghost hacking of skype and shit but she can&#39;t figure out who posted the videos? you don&#39;t even have to see the movie to know that it&#39;s complete garbage.¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaYo the big dude is from BathBoys!!!! 
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWow they&#39;re connections suck for skype.¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaGod damnit I kept on checking my skype account...
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis is going to flop 
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaHoly fuck some horror movies are going way to far!!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else check their Skype when they heard the notification sound?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaGood luck Laura, I&#39;m behind 666 proxies!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who saw the title and the thumbnail and thought it was a joke?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks atrocious.¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ll never ever use skype again
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like this was partially a rip off of Serial Experiments: Lain. ¬†Congrats America. ¬†No one will ever know.<br>They will all boast about how &quot;original&quot; this is.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaHorror has come to this. If it&#39;s pg 13 then you get jumpscares . Rated r you get Gore. it was so simple back then
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is dumb, or at least the concept of it is. A girl commits suicide due to the fact that she got wasted at a part, passed out, and someone video taped her, and posted it online. Now she comes to find the person who posted the video? What the hell is that supposed to do? I&#39;m going to watch this just so I could make fun of it. Wow. lol todays society guys.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWhat if they killed the person who posted the video??
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitano.¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitawhat a great trailer it spoiled the whole movie now I don&#39;t have to watch it¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaI checked my skype like 10 times throughout this whole trailer
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWatched this trailer 4 times now. I really want to see the movie¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaDamn!¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitalooks stupid
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis I have to see. looks to be totally freaky.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaAnd the liveleak com address works, just pointing that out boy n girls
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;hand in the blender&quot; shot made me burst out laughing. Holy shit does this look bad.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLikes new conceptüëç
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting concept but I can&#39;t see myself sitting to watch people talk on a screen for more than thirty minutes LOL. I get that the &#39;ghost&#39; or whoever tells them someone tells or they die...but would people honestly believe it and stay on the computer? I&#39;d run my ass to the police station. 
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaSoooooo no one could just close the laptop when the person said &quot;or someone dies?&quot; like wtf lol
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaFiquei com medo, nunca vi esse estilo antes. Vou assisti com certeza menos n√£o sendo muito f√£ de terror.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaSo THIS is Jigsaws new gig...
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaUNFRIENDED!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis looks really really really really really really really BAD
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaNot really scary looking but I love the concept. Also some people were asking why don&#39;t they just turn off the computer but at one part someone says don&#39;t leave or she&#39;ll kill you, or something like that
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshita<b>Facepalm</b> Horror Gods, look at what hollywood is doing to your name.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLooks fucking awful.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitai need to see this
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting but why don&#39;t they just close their laptops and talk in real life you know xD no joke awesome and interesting at the same time!¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks retarded.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaHaha wow this looked so bad....
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitais laura barnes are real girl???? please tell me this is fake
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis made me laugh so hard. This is such a stupid movie xD
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaLol they said &quot;new genre&quot; :p
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaUniversal Pictures¬†Why have you wasted on this. Do better please. Sometimes you go way low. (my opinion, if you liked it I dont judge you)
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaIts amazing how everyone in catching up with technology<br>Even the ghost is using Skype<br>Its very nice
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaInteresting concept, but could fail as well. We will just have to see.
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaOh shit
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitawhat in the flying fuck has horror come to?!?!?! this looks like shit!!! Fuck this found footage bullshit!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis is like original never saw this befour looks cool :)))
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaThis looks scary as crap. But not at the same time 
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaA horror about cyber bullying.....well that&#39;s one way¬†to scare the crap out of the children¬†
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaWTF? Hahaha! I&#39;m definitely checking this movie out when it&#39;s in theaters!
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaDid they just show the entire film?
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitathis is stupid
Lgj4GjqCFlYdelimeterByIshitaActually looks interesting.

5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaI really want to see this movie so badly!! Looks really good 
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaafter watching this... then re-reading the book... then watching this again... the thought of the ephemeral nature of our lives just overwhelmed me; almost gave me a sort of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; vibe, but one that&#39;s just too sweet and too precious. Ugh, the tears.
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaToo many thoughts about this to even write but first things first: WHAT&#39;S THE SONG?
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitawant. to watch. this. so. bad.

5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaMusic?
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for all the hipster movie critics to lavish hate on this even though they secretly enjoyed every second of it.¬†
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitalilly &lt;3 &lt;3¬†
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaHmm.. another generic, predictable movie about two young, attractive caucasians falling in love.. alright then. And the list continues to grow lmao
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaDo you mind checking out my youtube
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaoh... is another movie I can&#39;t wait to see!!!!!!!¬†
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaIf only our American youth years are as British as this.<br><br>(PS: I&#39;m Malaysian...)
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaThe Friendzone is strong with this one. I¬†will watch¬†this just to have a rant and complain about my love life, while I&#39;m getting¬†drunk on apple juice
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaim crying im ready
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaAHHHHHH! I need to see this movie!!!<br> 
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaHoly mother of friendzone ...lets have a moment for our friend. ..
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaI need to watch this movie it looks amazing! Now I wanna read the book lol
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaCan you put more up please
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer gave me goosebumps.. I can&#39;t wait for this movie too come out!
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitathey literally gave away the whole movie -.-
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaIs this one day part 2 haha
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaIn case you&#39;re wondering the song is High Hopes by Kodaline
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaThe ultimate friendzone movie? Honestly this doesn&#39;t look bad. Lily Collins is a good actress (in the GOOD movies I&#39;ve seen her in) and I liked Sam Claflin from Catching Fire.¬†
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely beautiful, can&#39;t wait to watch this in America.
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitalooks like they changed things from the book but I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad thing. I absolutely LOVE. IT. !!!!!!!!!!!
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitai have always been fan of big love stories and this seems interesting but i am not the biggest fan if lilly collins and her movies but i like sam claflin in the hunger game but it remains to be seen how good this movie will be.
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaI hope it&#39;s a bit different from the books and not so dragged out and boring at places.¬†
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitathe books was amaaazing &amp; this looks amaaazing.. Can&#39;t wait ;-))
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitashe has a good British accent considering she moved from England to America when she was only 5 I guess she got it from her father
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaLOVEEEEEE
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaBritish accent everywhere
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitahow to get out of the friendzone?
5zL3YJKygd4delimeterByIshitaSeems like a pretty good, romantic movie. Love movies, about love that whas not ment to be.

3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaAdam Jensen passes on the quote to katniss<br>&quot;I never asked for this&quot;
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaI was kind of hoping to hear TTL make an awesome music score for this trailer like the other two movies. I don&#39;t feel the hype this time around, and so I&#39;m left wanting more. Awww...I&#39;m disappointed. ;(
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaprim dies end of plot!
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s cool but no hunger game <br>
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaI didnt even really understand the ending of the second one it was so confusing 
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaHOLYF**K!

3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaMichael Bay
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaI clicked on this video to read all the funny comments about &quot;The Fappening&quot;. ¬†
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaOk.. Now she can destroy a warplane with a bow smh 
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaI already saw Katniss best parts, so I&#39;m not going to see this one... Hitting things with arrows like Rambo, yeah sure!
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaJesus who cares if it&#39;s divided in two?! The trailer looks amazing in my opinion and I bet the movie will be too. Up till now they&#39;ve been very careful of portraying the movie as similar as possible to the books. Love it :)
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PkkHsuMrho&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> Katniss for Smash Bros.!
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitai dont know if it&#39;s the movie or the book but the character development of this whole saga has been complete and utter shit
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaAh yes. So much yes!
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaOh never mind it&#39;s new
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaThis is not like the movie at all

3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaThere is no reason to look at her in a different light because of the leaked photos. Everyone is naked under their clothes. Get over it.<br><br>It&#39;s going to be another amazing movie to complement the superb series.
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaWhere is the trailer to her sextape ffs.
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaFinally, those useless boys seem like they actually have a role to play in this. Especially that Hemsworth dude. He seemed so pointless and good-for-nothing in the previous films...time to actually do something boys, make your name on that poster worth it.
3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitaHunger game sucks

3PkkHsuMrhodelimeterByIshitathis looks good and yay first comment
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitareally really good movie!!!!!!!!!!   but the ending is sooo sad...   and thank god the cristian lady got a bullet in her head so annoying........
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@TheConsoleGamer2K10 I agree SO much.  Worst movie ever~
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaNice trailer....it only shows the whole fucking movie.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaI loved the part when the old lady threw the can and hit the crazy Christian lady in the head!!!!!!!!!! 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe best part of the movie is the ending, for two reasons: 
1. The movie ends
2. They all f*ckin die!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaVery good movie! But the ending... aargh!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@SerbianMachoMan dude, it was a huge let down. the acting was terrible, the characters are ridiculous, and the guy kills his son for no reason
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitadamn sam witwer always ends up dying -.-
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThis movie had potential, but turned to be a 1/10 for me because of the annoying ass religious bitch.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaworst film i&#39;ve ever seen, ending was horrible, surprising since i&#39;m a huge king and darabont fan
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaGreat movie with an even greater ending, I was 27 when I saw this and cryed like a little girl at the end.  
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaOh for fuck&#39;s sake I already shouted YESSS!!! when the teacher slapped that religious bitch righ on the face, And... the ending is exasperating!!! I mean.... AGGG!!!! NOOO!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaOk everything was fine till... the dragon ??????? WTH but apparently, because of the comments, it is a good film, isn&#39;t it?
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita&quot;As a species we&#39;re fundamentally insane...Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another. People are basically decent, we&#39;re a civilized society...sure, as long as the machines are working and you can dial 911..but you take those things away, you throw people in the dark, you scare the SHIT out of them....no more rules!&quot;......SO FUCKING TRUE! 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaWow, that shitty trailer does NOT do the movie justice.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@InsideTheMirror I know...it just didn&#39;t flow right to me.I prefer the novella&#39;s ending because it was left open.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@eviltree99 As far as they knew stepping out into the mist for any longer than a minute or two got you immediately killed. There was nothing left to be hopeful for once they got stuck in the situation they were in. There&#39;s not even a guarantee that he lived, all it takes is a unexpected swarm and those soldiers and passengers are going to be slaughtered. And people contradict themselves all the time.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@InsideTheMirror I just wish they&#39;d made it closer to the book.I agree it doesn&#39;t need a happy ending but Stephen King so rarely gives endings that express hope it would have been nice if they did for this one.
Also,it didn&#39;t fit.Those people spent the entire movie saying that wouldn&#39;t give up.Why contradict it in the end?
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@platinum014 No....the novella&#39;s ending was very different.It was more open to interpretation but was leaning more in the direction that they all lived.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitano!....no! ....no!
the ending part was not good.
i wish i could change that
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@jhizzzzzz i never read the book. lol. i just knew Stephen King written it, so i assumed the ending was the same.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@platinum014 
No. The ending in the book was different from this movie. The ending was not from the book written by Stephen King directly. Get your facts straight before you correct other people.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@cocolicous06 the director didn&#39;t create the ending Stephen King did. He&#39;s the one that wrote the book.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaUgh! I fucking hate the fucking ending!!!!!!!!!!!! Why did the director have to create that part?! I wish the ending was just like they waited and they were rescued! DONE! Happy ending! :&quot;&gt;
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@yahoomlody haha yea but i think stephen king influenced the game, not the other way around
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@InsideTheMirror I agree dude...this movie was about social responses to adversity and fear, and help does not always come when someone exactly when someone needs it...
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@eviltree99 Terrible ending, how? They all rather die by a quick bullet to the head than get ripped apart and eaten alive, or have insects rip out of their chest cavity. And they didn&#39;t know the military was coming, not every ending has to be a happy rainbow pussy ending where everything happens JUST IN TIME, it just doesn&#39;t happen.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaIts a clever ending but i agree it is stupid at the same time
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitahave any of you guys relized that one of the army dude that gets throwen out looks like the appreantice off star wars
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThe end of the movie is so sad.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita0:34 silent hill?
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@Henka80 I know right?Great movie-terrible ending...Still worth watching.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathis story is a must watch, its much more than a monster story, this movie was really deep and we can relate to this, but the effects was cheesy as fuck
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaIf I was the director of this movie, I will direct and release the sequel. The Mist 2 will take place during the events of The Mist however the story will be told from the perspective of the U.S. Army which responded to the national crisis caused by the Arrow Head Project. The ending of the movie will be illustrated in conjunction with the ending of The Mist where the heroes or the main characters (shown by 2 soldiers) comes across Thomas Jane&#39;s character who is seen crying. 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@ThatAdoptedKid can&#39;t believe 40 other people said that too... :o
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaomg i didnt know ders a movie! i wanna watch it!. 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is basses but the ending is sad and fustrating!!! But overall a great movie!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@MizurriAMV i wasn&#39;t trolling you dumbass.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@ThatAdoptedKid lol you spelled it wrong. it should be &quot;kraken&quot;, not &quot;kracken&quot;.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaone of the most under-rated movies i ever saw.....sure its kind of cheap but its still amazing
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathat movie was soo freaky cool , does anybody know another movie like this?? please i need to know it!!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@minikola95 true dat!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitagreat trailer awful movie.the movie is so stupid and not even that scary.i have seen scarier movies.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe main character of star wars: the force unleashed video game is in this...Pause at 1:58 :)...Like if you see him
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitai thought it was a brilliant movie, truely demonstrated how humans would behave under desperate conditions, the ending was disappointing, i would&#39;ve banged that blonde before shooting her, she was kinda hot~
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@punkreeper God, I completely agree.
The thing about the woman who got shot that really got on my nerves is that there are so many people out there who take the view that religion calls for violence.
That&#39;s obviously not the case at all - all religions should be about is happiness. 
The Bible says &#39;Love thy Neighbour&#39;, not sacrifice him. 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaending sucked!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@Psychopath660 Yeah same mind man! I hate the ending of the movie too...
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@KillerWhiteWabbit  yea too bad theres no gorgon freeman
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThe sucky ending just proved reality doesn&#39;t always end in an happy ending.. still I was so so so so happy about the stupid woman who got shot :)) using God&#39;s word to kill people what a bitch!! 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@8281993 people are that stupid, like it said in the movie, you take away their technology and 911, scare the shit out them, and they&#39;ll turn to anyone who promises them survival.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe ending just made me so speechless. he&#39;d probably commit suicide though later. 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaone thing pissed me off so badly about this movie...the fact that evryone started to listen to the crazy chick who talked about god and shit...it really pissed me off , as if people were that stupid
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaomfg i just watched it and i hate how it ends!!!! it&#39;s just soooo sad :( :(
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThat bibel bitch makes me angry
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe end suck 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaSaw this yesterday on a Dutch channel this rocks but the ending
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitais it beter then the book?
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was a huge disappointment. 
The concept is stupid and boring.

Wouldn&#39;t recommened to anyone.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathis movie is awesome but not a happy end 
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaquite a gd movie... but the ending... :((
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaomg this movie is very good and very sad . more sad than the Titanic :S
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaI saw this video with my friend, geez i close my eyes alot of times.. and the end.. FUCKED UP!....i was getting so mad that he shot all he loved just seconds before they got rescude D:.. geez ! But good made movie, but not a movie i will see one more time &gt;.  &lt;
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaAwesome movie, a cut above the rest in modern horror cinema.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitafucking crap not even scary
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@ThatAdoptedKid hahah for real!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaat the end he will kill his son and 2 old peoples and a girl and affter 5 seconds help will come and he will be shocked 

LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaThats preacher lady was one crazy bitch....
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe trailer sucks. they should not shown the monsters so it can give a little mystery on what is behind the mist. It really spoiles for everyone who havent seen the movie and its a good one.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaman i feel like i just watched the whole movie seeing this.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaby the way guys if you have short temper and you hate jesus freaks dont watch this you will just gonna want to kill someone at the middle of the movie
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitagood movie only ending was pretty bad
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the music from 2:03?
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe guy from star wars the force unleashed 2 lol the army guy
and yup the movie was very good another stephen king masterpiece
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathis movie was awesome, but the traier gives up to much of the good stuff..
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@TheWilliams204  u miss the point of the movie...
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaI never I mean never piss or shit my pants in fear because i was expecting oh great another stupid horror lovy dovey shit like most other girls my age who like &quot;horror movies&quot; but i did shit my pants thank god at home in fear but i did not expect it bt my favorite part was the grandma killing that weird fucking spider thing with a can of hair spary and a liter
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaI hate the ending :(
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaonestly, i haven`t seen the movie but this looks more like drama n shit :D
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaHolly shit!....the aprentice from star wars is at  1:56 !

He should&#39;ve kicked all their asses xD!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe ending was just phony because after all that time they finally send in the army. a bit sooner  wouldve bin better
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitagreat ending!!!!
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitait was really good! but depressing...(the ending mostly)
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaOmg I saw this when I was like 11 and my parents were watching this .... It should be like rated pg-13 because it&#39;s not that scary ... And the end is sad
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathe movie was fucking great but the ending made me fucking pissed -.-
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitathis movie was sooooo cool and how the old lady made a flame thrower out of spray and a lighter TIGHT
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitai really like this movie, but the bitch that&#39;s making evreyone bealive crap is srsly more anoying then the mist-.-
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the music that starts at 1:26? i heard it in a watchmen trailer as well
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshitaI watched this movie last night, and it just grossed me out.  It was pretty good and not what I expected, but I don&#39;t particularly like watching movies that involve things like this one did, yuck lol.  
Anyways a good watch but I hated the ending.
LhCKXJNGzN8delimeterByIshita@TheFantasyWorl93

DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaSong? Thanks
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaIts a wonderful movie
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaWill Smith and his son starring! And base on a true story! As a parent, this movie touches the my heart. San Francisco Chinatown &amp; Oakland ! I‚Äôm recommending this movie to my 20 year old son and will be watching it with my 12 year old daughter . Thanks Netflix!!
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaSome Christians make implications that they want others to be as poor and as destitute as possible. This movie was a terrific example that living like that is no way to live. Even Christians themselves will happily live comfortable lives with enough money to do well, if they can. Televangelist Christians live like that. The pope and the cardinals in Rome, Italy live like that. There are plenty of Christians who live like that with high-paying white collar office jobs with nice houses and nice SUVs who live in nice suburbs. Living a penniless, destitute life is no way for anyone to live.
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaDID ANYONE HEAR PERIOD AT THE END
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is masterpiece . How one ordinary man works hard when his wife has gone ,his home was taken away . Sometimes he has to spend night in public toilet with his son . And at last he becomes best of his company.
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaA story that proves if you keep trying and work hard , you can be anything.

DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaI really, really, really hated Will Smith in the Prince of Bell Air, but I kinda had to watch it anyway becoz of all supporting cast. This movie is in my humble opinion this is his BEST performance as an actor so far ...

DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaWatched The Pursuit Of Happyness years ago, although based on true story I wasnt interested to see it again -yet one <b>powerful</b> memory: the &#39;hero&#39; (Will Smith) points out the Founding Fathers made the effort to embed the &#39;Pursuit Of Happiness&#39; in the American Constitution as a God given right for ALL.<br>    Fancy that...

DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaI really didn&#39;t like this movie
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m trying to find a movie that I think has Jamie Kennedy in it.  It is a romantic movie, and he plays the father of one of the female leads, and he looks a beach bum.  There was also hint of them them having a relationship.
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitakind of a silly movie.  do right by your children, work.  you don&#39;t live in closets lol.  should have started the movie after he got hired, he&#39;s a hell of a businessman in real life.
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitaI did heard it won the nomination at the MTV awards years ago Just didn&#39;t bother watching it. This will be my Do-list.
DMOBlEcRuw8delimeterByIshitai remember seeing this on Netflix good movie Will Smith played in. it shows a great deal of how one can live through poverty and surivive on such little to get to something big and so he did.

etWeYkQ_KLwdelimeterByIshitaI want to work in Hollywood films.
etWeYkQ_KLwdelimeterByIshitaImagine this one being done back in 90s‚Ä¶

etWeYkQ_KLwdelimeterByIshitaEscape Plan is as dull as dishwater, and the ending is a rip-off of Face/Off (1997) - a movie which was written for Stallone and Schwarzenegger. <br><br>There&#39;s more excitement in Face/Off&#39;s prison scenes than in the entirety of Escape Plan. Skip this snoozefest and watch Face/Off instead.

SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaI have to watch this movie for my forensic psychology class, I thought it was gonna be another boring &quot;and they lived happily ever after, despite the mental illness&quot; movie but after seeing this trailer it seems far more realistic. That&#39;s good
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaFrom Stanford prison experiment.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitawhoever was told that spamming a movie with red for foreshadowing and symbolism makes a movie good needed to be in that gym too

SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaEverything is fine!  She&#39;s ancient one,  she can protect herself
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaWe need to talk about this movie; It sucks. The non-linear editing is off the rails and fractures the narrative. Tildas patented catatonic stare is annoying. Goofy &quot;massacre&quot; scene. Don&#39;t bother.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaJoji + Connan = Kevin
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaThis Film Is a legend

SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitahis mom killed Aslan
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitahe doesn&#39;t put a spoiler in, you find that out at the beginning 
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaPeople who want to see this film shouldn&#39;t read the description of this video. It kind of reveals a part of the film that is best unknown to enjoy it to its fullest. Fantastic film by the way. I recommend Ratcatcher as another great work by Lynne Ramsay... Now.. to ruin my slightly respectable and insightful comment by saying I am absolutely hammered and am on verge of passing out. Cheers x
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshita@QuantumPoole HAH, that&#39;s what I said!
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshita&quot;The mother of a teenage boy who went on a high-school killing spree tries to deal with her grief - and feelings of responsibility for her child&#39;s actions.&quot; Why put that in the summary and ruin the plot for people!?!?!?!?! ANNOYING.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshita&quot;The mother of a teenage boy who went on a high-school killing spree tries to deal with her grief - and feelings of responsibility for her child&#39;s actions.&quot;

Erm, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to spoil the movie in the description of said movie&#39;s trailer. Just saying.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaEh that kid just needs a few ass whoopings
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshita@thedog137 he is a sociopath
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitawow scary as shit
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck is that kids problem lmfao
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaHope the movie is as good as the book
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaTitles arn&#39;t meant to be sentences. That&#39;s why they are called titles.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaLooks gd
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshita@spinelle77 I think they meant winter 2011 because everywhere I&#39;ve read Dec. 9th 2011.
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaWtf winter 2012?!!! We gotta wait a year damn
SfQaRK3BCYUdelimeterByIshitaOh my God. The melody at the end freaked me the hell out.

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;Jane Austen has never been funnier&quot;...Yea she&#39;s dead
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI laughed the entire movie!!!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaAbsolutely delightful!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale is all I need in a movie.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI just saw it today and it was an excellent film.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaCant wait to see this! &quot;Disco Days&quot; is one of my favorite movies! Cool to see Chloe and Kate together again!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;No, I know him well, I would never talk to a stranger like that.&quot;<br><br>Epic troll.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate&#39;s got a new movie hell yeah.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitalol.  white people.  <br><br>it does have selene though
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaEnjoyed the Jane Austen short book, but will wait for it to come out on Sky movies.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI saw the film. Kate Beckinsale was funny and great having all those long dialogues (I really love her acting and am a huge fan of hers) and actually everybody acted really well (incl Tom Bennett and Xavier Samuel - his tears-scene etc). But the story remained a little unclear to me (who liked who or that Lady Susan was seducing those men or what was going on exactly) and it was filmed more like fragments or sketches. Maybe it&#39;s me and I need to watch it again and with subtitles this time.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis film is apparently very good. Empire awarded it 5 stars!!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitamy wife and I busted out laughing @<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> where the gentleman approaches the ladies and say &quot;lady Susan, lady Susan&quot; <br><br>and Kate says don&#39;t you ever address me like that, now go away before I have you whipped... <br><br>then her friend says how rude, have you met before, and <br><br>Kaye replies YES, I would never talk to a stranger like that <br>hahahahahaah.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaSo just a while ago I was thinking, &quot;Does Lady Susan have a film adaptation or something?&quot; and proceeded to search about it and found this. O M G!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI LOVE movies like this! I can&#39;t wait to see it! They are only showing it one night in one theatre in my city. I will be there at the ten o&#39;clock showing, and I will sleep late on Friday. So giddy!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s strange to see Emma Woodhouse act like Lady Susan :)
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaPoor transcription!!!!!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale looks amazing in this. Even better as Lady Susan than she was as Emma.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitawhat happen to chloe , she become so ugly
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> LOL

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;Oh, no, I know him well! I&#39;d never speak to a stranger like that!&quot; Kate! :)

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitael vestuario es un asco
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI like these &#39;Jane Austenesque&#39; dramas where some of the content is more adult and modern while keeping the original author&#39;s style intact, like Death Comes to Pemberley.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> Stephen Fry is in it. I love him.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitalooking forward to Kate Beckinsale that one day she will hold the Oscar award for best Actress, I like her so much.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaMs. Beckinsale...i&#39;m still waiting on that next Underworld film...preferably with Scott Speedman again (and India Eisley)
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis looks good!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaHello! Richard Armitage.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaGreen balls.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI will be straight for her. Only for her.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale would be a perfect Cheetah
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaa former Emma returns to the realm of Jane Austen.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaa former Emma returns to the realm of Jane Austen.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale might be the most beautiful woman on the planet.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitalove Kate
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Emma grew up
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI remember Kate as Emma awhile back really excited for this
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI dunno...the humor feels a little forced. Fingers crossed it works better in the overall movie.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to watch it !!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitai will definitely see dis...<br>mann...what a combination of acting n d script....<br>kudos...
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaDownloaded this to show to my wife later. Would love to know the release date for this.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale would probably make a good Mary Poppins.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;How dare you adress me, Sir! Begone or I will have you whipped!&quot; <br>&quot;Outrageous! Have you not met him?&quot; <br>&quot;&quot;No, I know him well. I would never speak to a stranger like that.&quot;
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitakate is so talented !! i want her more in movies !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks promising and Kate Beckinsale is absolutely alluring!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis should be very interesting.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaWhy we pay money to watch this movie is boring as hell
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait to watch it! english humor at it&#39;s best
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita???????
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI would only watch this because of Kate Beckinsale. She¬¥s joy to my eyes.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaShe  has been unlucky with some of her role choices but she has nailed it on this one. Love Jane Austin and this looks hilarious and Kate looks stunning.  Hope it does well at box office.

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI thought it was a lesbian movie lol but it looks funny anyway.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI adore Kate Beckinsale üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaCheeky m8
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaDid Jane Austen herself actually came up with the &quot;tiny green balls&quot; part?
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaAlready bubbling with amusement. Seeing it.

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaBOOOORING
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaFirst she was Emma, now she&#39;s Lady Susan! <br>üòäüëçüèº
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitathis actually looks good, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d be too much distracted and sad from noticing botox on once-stunning-kate beckinsale&#39;s face while watching it.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitakate looks so young and fresh üòä
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate beckinsale is still fine af
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;How jolly! Tiny green balls, what are they called?&quot;    &quot;Peas.&quot; Hahahahahah
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaWhite chicks 2
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaNah thats not real because Kates Hair is not perfect...
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaYes! Finally, my favourite Jane Austen piece on film! Such amazing and well thought out characters !
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI liked this before watching because.. Austen :D
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis type of movie just isn&#39;t complete without Steven Fry. And there he is.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita&quot;My brother is very RICH&quot;
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaWhic Jane Austen book is THIS from anyway???
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaWhere has Kate been all this time
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaLove, Friendship &amp; Zombies
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI think I see amazon at the beginning so I&#39;m like: &quot;Dafuq? My mind is completely gone, I&#39;m hopeless.&quot; Then I see it again at the end so I go back and &quot;Wow, it was there after all. So, amazon in the movie industry...The things you can do with money these days!&quot;
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI really Like Kate and from what i&#39;ve seen of Chloe i like her too, but this film..i don&#39;t know
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is beneath Kate.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitait&#39;s looks like another bbc vision
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaOMG this is hysterical! I&#39;m definitely watching this!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaGorgeous and hilarious ^^<br>I wanna see it right NOW<br><br>And her look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0&amp;t=1m17s">1:17</a> ... AH! She&#39;s a goddess !!!<br>Loved her in Van Helsing, love her still ...
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaI adore both Kate &amp; Chloe. They&#39;re very underrated &amp; extremely talented. Can&#39;t wait to see this. :)
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaIn my view, Kate Beckinsale is an underrated actress. Maybe this film is the chance for her to show her great talent. From the trailer it seems like  a promising movie and as far as I know it got rave reviews.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaCancer
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitashe is stunning, still!!
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaKate so nice
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaJolly gud traila I presume.

8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita100% on rotten tomatoes
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshitaWhere has Kate been this whole time? I haven&#39;t seen her in a movie in a few years.
8MaSK3POHI0delimeterByIshita2
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaBloody good film
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI just red the book, and I like it, but I&#39;m not sure about reading second part of ,,Karla&#39;&#39;-can somebody suggest me to read (or not)?<br>PS:Sorry for my english, I&#39;m from France.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favourite films
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this film for like six times, and still this trailer gave me shivers. Spectacular.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaProbably the dumbest title for a movie. Jesus.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWow, what a cast!  Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, and Benedict Cumberbatch?!  If this movie was made today, that would be one expensive drama movie.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone tell me why this film is great without sounding like annoyingly pretentious? Please refrain from things like it&#39;s &quot;intellectually stimulating&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m still trying to work it out, but I know it&#39;s great.&quot;  Try not to claim the reaction without telling me why. I&#39;m all for challenging films. I&#39;m just not quite sure why this film is great. I&#39;m willing to give it another go. I&#39;ll blame myself before I blame the film. I haven&#39;t seen it since it was released in the cinema but I remember being a little bored. I suppose I wasn&#39;t following it completely? <br><br>From what I remember, the film plays out like a book maybe a bit like The Wire but without the long-form advantage of a TV series. It was heavy with information about things and people that we weren&#39;t viewing. Which got me thinking. Why is this a film? Perhaps some things read better or don&#39;t require the visual medium of film. <br><br>I saw someone praise the cinematography. Hmmm.. Reall?. While it&#39;s not bad, it&#39;s mostly talking heads. It doesn&#39;t call for any particularly innovative, challenging or complex cinematography. <br><br>I&#39;ll give it another go but I&#39;m remaining skeptical.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaBritish stories are only better if they are produced and written by American/Hollywood people.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaHow is it possible that Gary Oldman has not won an Oscar?
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI really like the film anyway, but man this trailer totally misrepresents it.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWatched at least a half dozen times.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGreat adaptation of this book to film .
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThere is only one Smiley... And that is Alec Guinness.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaSirius Black, King George VI, Bane, the War Doctor, Sinestro, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Arnim Zola, and Grand Pabbie are all in this film.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitahe is the MFu Kim Phliby again!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaFucking well made movie trailer
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGreat intelligent film.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaAs Elite class is the best among people..<br>Mangoes are best in fruits<br>This movie is best among all the movies.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaAwesome movie..
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaA good try, but the 1979 TV series is still better.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the music?
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaCan someone recommend me some spy movies as good as this one? It gave mea huge crave for quality spy-movie... but I don&#39;t know where to start.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGary Oldman, John Hurt, and Benedict Cumberbatch...damn. I always ready the comments to see what other people think of the movie
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is basically a white-wash of British society.  In the TV version, the mole (based on Kim Philby)  explains his betrayal as hatred for the U.S. &amp; not love of communism or the Soviet Union.  He sees Americans &amp; their culture as vastly inferior to the British.  Consequently, he resents America&#39;s leading role in the West.    Essentially, he&#39;s a monumental, bi-sexual, snob who will put anyone at risk, including his lovers (which results in his undoing), in order to maintain his sense of Anglo superiority.   <br><br>In fact, double agent, Philby tried to spread disinformation on both sides in the hope that the U.S. &amp; the Soviet Union would destroy each other.  That way, Britain would emerge from the ashes to resume it&#39;s globalist empire, presumably as neither capitalist or communist, but a hybrid of the technocratic/technological elite, i.e. technocracy, as we see in China,  Germany &amp; the new Macron government, in France.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaSo I just ATTEMPTED to watch this movie...  I&#39;m not gonna say it was bad.  But if I wanted to watch a terrible movie that looks and feels like it&#39;s 40 years old.  I&#39;d watch a 40 year old movie.  God!  The first 10 minutes are the beginning credits with that weird 70s cop/spy movie trumpet music playing on a loop.  WTF?!  Movies haven&#39;t been made like this in years for a reason!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaEvery British A-list actor got a part in this movie.  Ha!  Except Christian Bail, lol
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the five best movies I have seen in my life ,whoever who says things about boring and slow rithm, really don&#39;t know nothing the purpose of cinematography
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI found this so difficult to follow which I love. Hate being force fed, you really need to concentrate... I just wasn&#39;t expecting it. Probably gotta watch it a couple of more times still.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaBest last 100 seconds in film history
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWas it good?
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaIs this like Kingsman?
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI re watched tinker tailor soldier spy. That movie gets better every time I see it.  Gary Oldman performance is remarkably understated yet he dominates the movie. I also picked up on the fact that the Benedict Cumberbatch character when told to clear up his business gets rid of his gay lover. I didn&#39;t see that in the first viewing.  Overall I just Think it&#39;s a five star film, they have to be the  angriest people in that understated British way ever put on screen. Also I don&#39;t like Colin Firth much but I think he&#39;s perfectly suited for this role the right amount of poshness, sleaze and easy charisma. All that and John Hurt giving it one of his best.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThe real spies... I can wath this movie all the time and it¬¥s not boring me... :)
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThe most British movie ever
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaUS trailer? Even the trailer would be too complex.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaand this ladies and gentlemen is how you make a fu*kin trailer! ahh-maz-ing! the movie is good, especially if you enjoy &quot;spy&quot; genre, but not as good as this trailer! I can rewatch this over and over again!  :)
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitacool
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaCommissoner Gordon, Harry Hart, Bane, Sinestro,Dr.Strange, Arnim Zola, Mephistop and The Viper are in this movie.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWow! Harry Hart / Galahad, Merlin, Sherlock, and Handsome Bob all in the same movie. Must see!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis film is a definite must watch twice film. 2nd viewing reveals this film for the masterpiece it is. Brilliantly edited and minimalist approach that suggests something so much greater and more insidious.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaJust watched this last night.... fantastic!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThe title itself would make for a good tongue twister.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitawow, how many faces does Tom Hardy have? Amazing.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaJames Bond, while you&#39;re screwing around and destroying trains, Smiley was doing some actual decent work!<br><br>EDIT 2020<br>After reading the book and looking up some other things about the character, I do think this dumb joke has some truth in it. Smiley is kind of an anti-Bond, right down to the fact that he is not a womanizer, but is actually being cheated on by his wife.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast! I get excited every time I see John Hurt in a movie unexpectedly.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaBest SPY movie ever released !!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaNot for everyone. Definitely a drama... I prefer Departed or Usual Suspects.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaA future classic, now is the time to put to movie the life of Richard Sorge, one of the greatest spies of ww2.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitavery very good :) thumps up
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaAnd......I just watched the whole movie in 2 minutes. Not bad.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitasuch an awesome movie and so underrated.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece of cinematography
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaTinker, Tailor, Shepherd&#39;s pie.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW-F1H-Nonk&amp;t=00m48s">00:48</a> Aaaand that&#39;s the entire movie spoiled right there.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI am so confused about this movie. Tell me what this movie really means please.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitabuena banda sonora
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI hope to god they don&#39;t do an awful Hollywood remake; I can imagine it now, Chris Pine is cast as Smiley and Karla is actually a woman played by Anne Hathaway. The movie ends with a car chase after which Karla and her little boy go to live with Smiley in Scotland under the name &quot;Colonel Laurence&quot;. Of course, there would be endless sequels, starting with Smiley 3: Polyakov&#39;s Revenge!Ôªø
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis is How you make a TRAILER,one Word AMAZING!!!!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s one of those cases where the film is better artistically than the novel. ¬†Keep an eye on John Hurt&#39;s performance. ¬†Gary Oldman&#39;s characterization reminds me of a cobra waiting to strike. ¬†Both the male and female actors give you unexpected gems. ¬†Outstanding.¬†
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie myself, I found it very stimulating if you follow it all the way through. Like people have commented, it&#39;s very complex but rewarding to analyze. Hell, I&#39;m still trying to figure it out myself. Nonetheless, I have never found a movie more intellectually stimulating than this one, I have not once grown tired of the music, the scenes, and the atmosphere. I especially loved the portrayal by Gary Oldman of George Smiley.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI like the actors but this movie is boring as fuck
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie and amazing cast!!!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks awesome. Been looking for some smart stuff to watch after all the light hearted but brainless stuff I&#39;ve been exposed to
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaYou need to read the book.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve watched this movie 5 times and im still confused &gt;.&lt;
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI knew americas advertising would make it look more action-y than it is ahaha Things are not always what they appear to be
(fantastic film by the way, Gary Oldman was amaizng)
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaHad to stop watching the trailer, I can&#39;t let any scenes spoil the movie when I go see ! OMGOMGOGMOGMomgogmogomg!!!!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@AlanG1997 I erred. Not in honorable school boy but in Smiley&#39;s People.  David Cornwell stated this is an interview after he worked with Guinness in TTSP - a video interview available on the BBC DVD.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThe song at the end sounds like music from Metal Gear Solid
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitai like the part where benedict cumberbatch
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGary Oldman? I thought that was Gary Coleman! Oh darn it.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@TheComyslayer Come back when you&#39;ve read the book. In fact, come back when you&#39;ve read a book.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaOh I really love old school spy style~! and there is Gary Oldman~! 
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie and the HONEST TRUTH of what you will expect (not whether I think it is good or bad): Very SLOW mystery drama, and it is 85% or more just dialogue.  Meaning people are talking softly in a small room in a monotone voice.  This is NOT a THRILLER it is not like a Jason Bourne, James Bond, etc. There is no suspenseful music or edge of your seat scenes leading to a climatic end as this trailer makes it seem. It is more like &quot;the tree of life&quot; but more complex/confusing.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know about you guys, but I would find it kind of hard to say &quot;One for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy please&quot;.  Something about the name puts me off.  Other than that, great trailer.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaeach time I see Gary Oldman on screen, I know that I&#39;ll finish the movie even if it sucks. That&#39;s how good Oldman is!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s got Tom Hardy. That&#39;s all I need to go see it. 
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaHope they show this movie in a nation wide release. It is in select theaters over here at the moment in the USA. Would love to see it. Looks incredible. The cast looks brilliant. Garry Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Tom Hardy. If it doesn&#39;t get a nation wide release then I will have to wait for the DVD. 
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaLOL...that damn MOLE!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGary Oldman is a spy!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis seems like a very good thriller.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitawow heavy weight actors. i gotta see this one &gt;.&lt; b
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaLooks great. Can&#39;t wait to see it. I will always remember him to be Jim Gordian from The Dark Night!!
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaIs this Inception 2.0? 
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is not playing anywhere! What the hell.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitagary oldman was a total douche in the movie Murder in the first. hes such a good actor. 
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaGary Oldman is great.  One of my favorite actors now.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaI love movies where I go &quot;Wait...That was Gary Oldman?!&quot;
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@m3andros this is one thing people who love movies wouldnt do, fuck you

VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@rotrooney  thanks :)
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@ketzalcoat The first part as you said is from wolfman but the later part of the trailer soundtrack  is audio machine- black cauldron. Via Flexlol.
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@Flexlol Thanks dude!

VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshita@rotrooney artist: Danny Elfman title: Wolf Suite Pt.1. 
This music is also the soundtrack of the movie called &quot;The Wolfman&quot;

VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitawhy does this remind me of inception?
VW-F1H-NonkdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the name of the soundtrack in the second half of the trailer?

h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t she the actress from the EXAM-SCAM thai movie?
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaWhy does this remind ME of Gordan Ramsey .
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitais this girl from that genius college entrance exam movie?
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaIf you liked The Menu, you should check out The Bear, it&#39;s amazing
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaAhh okay, This is Gordon Ramsey in a different country/language.  lol

h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitais it web series ?
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaLooks great, as a fan of &#39;The Menu&#39; last year, this has themes &amp; elements inherent to that film as well, so this looks to be a film I am ready to devour!
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaI would pay $1000 a dish for a chef like that
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaDid they use Gelb&#39;s trailer editor for this? Too similar to be a coincidence
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaFrom the Menu to this!. More pleaaaase!
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaOnly india famous Netflix üòÅ 1 month free kar doüëç
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaIm so freaking exciteddd
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaReminds me of The Bear.
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaWhiplash for Cooking
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitathat, was intense.

h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaWatch &quot;Hunger&quot; from 2008 instead.
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaSaved! Definitely watching this!
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaThis is like Hell‚Äôs Kitchen: The Movie
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaThe Bear, the Menu, Boiling point‚Ä¶. Cmon Netflix have an original thought for once
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaJust looks like Menu.
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaThis is why you don&#39;t take cooking as a career, it literally sucks your soul out
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaA psychological thriller about cooking, I&#39;m definitely hungry for this one
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaThai version of the menu feat gordon ramsay
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshitaWould it be like The Bear, but overdramatized.
h61PbLOmyY0delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h61PbLOmyY0&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> looks like stg Salt Bae wld do.

S3AVcCggRnUdelimeterByIshitathis looks bad, i believe you can only make one hit ¬†wonders with comedy movies , for example hangover, the first one was good the others were crap, but they tried milking more out of the franchise

X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaO_o You know, if you checked WHY I said fuck you twice, maybe be a little bit less of a complete ass, only reason I commented is because you didn&#39;t need to use deaf in an insulting way, yes, I may have gotten carried away, but the point still stands, also takes like two seconds to type. Why does everyone assume it takes an hour to type these things out?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitamarky mark? holy shit, this will be fantastic. explosions everywhere.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the worst movie...that I will watch 100 times

X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI would see this cuz it looks ok and The Rock is in it, but I&#39;m never putting in my good fuckin money on a Mark Whalberg movie again because he is against guns for civilians &amp; he does all these gun movies &amp; makes money off of em. Fuck that prick

X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaTre, if you&#39;re going to ask if he&#39;s doing it for the def... spell it fucking right! It&#39;s deaf, and no, he&#39;s doing it for the likes, hell maybe he just thought that was ridiculous and wanted to put it in case someone was going to skip the trailer but would watch the whole thing to figure out how that fits. My point is, fuck you for not spelling out deaf, and fuck you for using deaf in a sarcastic comment.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaand don&#39;t forget, then they embrace
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitamichael bay directing...?

X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI...don&#39;t know what to think of this.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaMark got big a&#39;f
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitais it me or know on every new movie theirs more gay stuff?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaNot enough explosions for a Bay movie.


This could be good.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitadid anyone notice Klitschko 0:44 
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitayea
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitawhat is that sound track during the end.. i need that sound track for my workout 
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA! That was a brilliant line when they said it, I was in stitches! But when you wrote it down i was like hahahahalololo!!!!11 OMG that&#39;s too funny man! 
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaWhats the last song at the end?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshita2:26 it&#39;s funny cuz he&#39;s the main character in the new G.I. Joe movie, which is all about killing LOL
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaYes the rock is making a movie with thugonamics cena and big e langston 1:09. Lol i can&#39;t wait to see the movie it looks pretty sick.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitayeah....  i dunno....
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell I&#39;m I looking at.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitada hell?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI did enjoy Transformers but even if this movie looks ok I still have low expectations  
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty cool. But what if I switched it around and made it a WWE Film instead. And it would starred John Cena, The Rock, and Kofi Kingston. Now that probably would be badass.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitabest part haha
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI smell a razzie here
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks like a good micheal bay movie. At least passable.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaWhat the fuck?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis is as stupid as the director himself....
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaWtf is this?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so ridiculous. I&#39;m still gunna watch it though:P
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitawait.... did i see tony schaloub??
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaLast song: &quot;Kids&quot; by Sleigh Bells.
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI smell an Oscar nomination..

X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaDaniel: When&#39;s this is over, we&#39;ll go camping

Paul: Ok

LOL!
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaLooks Awesome, cuz THE ROCK s in it! 
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaMicheal Gay ? could expect lots of unnecessary explosions !
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaDo you even lift?
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaI need transformers 4!!!!
X4orHp2y2ZQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s gonna be another hit for Michael Bay, even if this movie cost $22 million to make. It&#39;s gonna be a hit, no matter what!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks fun but it seems like a  really cliche teen movie.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t even know the book had become a movie. 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song at the very beginning of the preview??? Or is that just an original composition???
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaQUE Ascooooo de TRAILER <br>NOSE QUE ESPERAR DE LA PELICULAAA
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitamy life in a movie,but i dont have a jock transforming me.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI wont to see this movie so bad
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWow! I can&#39;t wait to see this movie! It looks so original. The characters don&#39;t seem like doppelgangers of other characters in other high school teen movies and it looks like it might not have the ever so generic handsome-boy-makes-deal-with-plain-Jane-girl-to-help-her-become-cool-but-then-ends-up-falling-for-her plot. It&#39;s clearly Not another teen movie and I can&#39;t wait to see it!!!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaohh man another teen romantic comedy filled with cliches and rehashed things we&#39;ve seen before. robbie amell before his firestorm days
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaEsto ¬†es horrible! destruyeron el libro completamente, Bianca nunca quiere ni cambia su manera de vestir y tampoco se interesa en hacerse popular .-.¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSo how is this different that say &quot;She&#39;s all that&quot; ????
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaHe always plays the football role in movies
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitai see bella thorne in everything wheres zendaya? doing acne commercials.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThey took the book, aber destroyed it....
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThe book was surprisingly good so I&#39;m hoping this is the same
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitawasn&#39;t Bianca &quot;the ugly and fat of the gang&quot;? I read that somewhere and this actress is definitely not fat or ugly
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaUh-huh, so another teen comedy that will obviously end with her getting together with him.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaCould this POSSIBLY get even MORE cliche and cheesy?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s not fat...
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI am a duff... Well atleast something
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLook so diferent.. I prefer the book. :c
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaDoes any1 knw da name of da song?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitacliche movie that we all fall victim to watching lol. 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLol. Bella thorne playing herself
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaEu ri kkkkkkkk
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSo..basically another &quot;She&#39;s All that.&quot; movie
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaDesignated Ugly Fat Friends, in fairness. give better bj&#39;s. Cause you know...something to prove. No girl with high self esteem gives beautifully filthy bj&#39;s.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaVery very disappointed in this movie theater in the book  nothing happens this way. Bianca doesn&#39;t ask for help to stop being the DUFF, where&#39;s her dad, mom issues, the healing from Wesley. Like I&#39;m very unimpressed they changed the meaning of the book that I loved. Bianca&#39;s not even cynical wth ?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s like every other generic teen movie since the early 90&#39;s?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThe name of the song is Natalia Kills - Problem 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes the book look dumb and &#39;funny&#39; when it is totally the opposite, it&#39;s a really good book that talks more about accepting yourself than being accepted 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaAhhhh I want to see this so bad because I loved the book, but it just looks so different :( 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI can do that flex thing he did, 16 different ways....With my ASS! Ahan
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWhen I read the book (which is really good) I never imagined this, i&#39;m kinda dissapointed! Anyway I can&#39;t way to see the film, although im pretty sure that they change the plot a lil bit.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLove the book! Hope the movie is as great:)
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaso...the spiritual sequel to mean girls as opposed to those god awful actual sequels
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaShes all that, light?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitameh.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaHmmm She&#39;s All that for Millennials and younger? I&#39;d still watch it. :D
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaweasley &quot;sigh&quot;
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitai was totally turned off by bella thorne being in it but it actually looks like a really good movie, i might see it
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaCherry coke.¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaHer?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaKatara ain&#39;t no DUFF
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWell the book is awesome i hope the movie is worthy 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitawaiit its hes just not that into you in high school!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m only going to see this for Mae Whitman. She is so awesome.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI loved the book of this but they look like they&#39;ve changed it a lot for the movie 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLA CAMBIARON MUCHO!!! DIOS CREO QUE SERA UNA DE ESAS PELICULAS QUE SOLO USAN LOS NOMBRES! :( que mal este es mi libro favorito y so√±aba con la pelicula u.u
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaHave a feeling this is gonna be a guilty pleasure film of mine 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWhat the name of the song in the trailer.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaAnybody noticed she js the voice actress of katara?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSame High School Drama sexist themes like always. BOOOORING!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI bet you the girl gets with the guy at the end
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSpoilers: He ends up with the jock
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThe book is absolutely amazing I&#39;m soo FRECKen excited that there making a movie! Yassss
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaIs it weird I don&#39;t find her ugly or fat? :P I think she&#39;s short, doesn&#39;t wear make up and dresses normally....so that&#39;s the definition of ugly? I mean, I guess a movie/ book with this premise can&#39;t win everyone over due to the fact that one way or the other they&#39;re going to be calling someone &#39;ugly&#39;, but she looks very healthy to me.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSenor Chang YOU SNITCHES!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what people say but this film looks really good
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaStill better than Twilight?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThis seems pretty different then the book?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI hate straight to DVD movies 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaOh let me guess she gets the guy. -_- <br>
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWow this movie actually looks good. 
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitai prefer duff girls
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s All That all over again... YAWN!!!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI bet you I can tell you how it ends.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWell this is original.¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaSounds a bit like the movie She&#39;s All That but it looks good. Gotta pick up the book now. Go Bella!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaRepeat of &quot;She&#39;s all that&quot;
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitayep, i guess i&#39;ve found the next movie ill be watching with my guurls at our pj parties
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaher...really?
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaWHAT YEAR IS IT
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaooowww
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThe book is so much better i can already tell but i will still watch it because of that fact.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaDuffman!!! Oh yeah!!!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI like it
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitano es como el libro
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaFrom the leading role in shake it up or barley smart movie parts? oooh Bella!!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaHaha looks pretty funny
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitai will watch this because Robbie &lt;3
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaKen Jeong ???!!! Why Your&#39;e better than this!!!!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitathis better be good because i freaking loved the book.¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitazzz
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has never been made before. Gives a whole new meaning to the singer Hillary Duff. (Definitely not a DUFF)
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaOmg! This is a book right ?!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaoh no..... otro estereotipo que hollwood viene a imponer :P
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie almost has the same plot as &#39;&#39;Not Another Teen Movie&#39;&#39;... ....¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaI honestly expected DUFFMAN, OH YEAH!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaDuff man was not in this trailer 0 outta 10 will not watch again
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitathis looks like a really bad and clich√© movie.¬†
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaIts funny cuz shes Duff!
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaOh Kitara, how fall you&#39;ve fallen.
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitadamn, I thought the main character was the blondie
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLastima que no se parezca al libro
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaeh cliche. geeky girl somehow makes a deal with cool guy. At first he&#39;s not interested, then over the course of the transformation they fall in love, but he&#39;ll still act like he doesn&#39;t like her. When the deal is done and the girl is &quot;acceptable&quot; and liked by everyone. He realizes he likes her and blah blah blah
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitanot bad. hope it turns out okay :)
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks NOTHING like the book
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaLook awesome to me
ci7eKlNRiuwdelimeterByIshitaFirst comment yay
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaHollywood never once allowed Korean movies to be nominated. Only Japan because Japan stole Asia&#39;s limelight so early on. They destroyed the rest of Asia after WW2 that America only supported all things Japanese. I cannot wait for the day til Hollywood accepts and nominates Korean films for oscars.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI saw it on 2d1n isnt the movie about a korean assassin who kills the japanese someone, omg i cried when watching the story on 2night 1 day
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so obsess with Gong Yoo because of &quot;Goblin&quot; and &quot;A Man and A Women&quot; üòç <b>The hottest Ahjussi I ever see</b> üòçüòçüòç
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI will watch anything with Kang-oh Song! The guys just a beast of an actor!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI miss u.. godlin opps gong yoo
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaAh so this is what the Goblin was doing during the 900 years he has been alive
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitadokebi
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaWow! Warner Brothers?!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshita.........and years later he meet his goblin-bride
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaBaradwaj Rangan brought me here, anyone else?
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitagong yoo u are the best
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaGongyoo nan sarang!!theres nothing he really can&#39;t do!!!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI feel like they already made this movie. Korean-resistance spies trying to complete a mission and one of them turns out to be a Japanese informant. Assassination already did the same thing a few years before this (although it was fairly mediocre). Though its Jee Woon-Kim making this one, who&#39;s one of South Korea&#39;s best working directors and the reviews a pretty solid, so I&#39;m positive this will be the better movie of the two.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitagreat engrossing film. get me hooked from the beginning till end. no wonder! millions of people watched it every scene is worth watching. not a second is a waste.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaLooks like it&#39;s a great movie, BUT probably it was nomitaded for Oscar (despite the Handmaiden), because of the Warnes Bros production...
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI used to think korean thrillers were too slow burning when i saw sympathy and lady vengance. But when i revisited some others &quot;i saw the devil, memories of murder, yellow sea, chaser, the wailing&quot; i was right at home. My question is, is it possible for american writers to make connections in the asian markets? I really appreciate what Korea and China have been working on, and also sion sino and kitano in japan. I really want to write for an industry that values the kind of stories and tonal intensity I thrive for.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaWow Korean have a really talented actors, that&#39;s why the Hollywood hire them üëçüèª
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaMy SugarDaddy GongYoo üòçüòçüòç<br>amazing as always

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitahe proves himself that he&#39;s not only handsome..but also a very serious and great actor..proud of himüòôüëç
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaMan, how did I miss this trailer months ago?!  Trailer looks great, and I hope it gets a proper US release soon. I&#39;ll travel out of town for this if I have to... And I will.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitagreat actors in line...wow warner bros
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaDetective from Memories of Murder.....Hell YES im going to watch this movie.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitawho the hell wants to read 2hours of sub titles

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaIs he really 37-38?? Korean Tom cruise
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaThis reminds of the Assassination starring Jun Ji Hyun.. :)
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitado you think its good? idk whether should i watch it or no
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaGong yoo will be imprisoned in the end because he got caught and the &quot;real mole&quot; song kang ho will bomb the venue of a celebration of the higher ups japanese conquerors
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitagong yoo is really versatile

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaGong yoo never gets old.<br><br><br>well <br>he actually does but then, <b>AGE MAKES HIM SEXIER AND MORE GOODLOOKING THAN ANY OTHER ACTOR OUT THERE</b>
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaSong Kang ho is always on another level.

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaIn this movie there&#39;s a man and a woman,  he&#39;s on a train to busan, and he looks like a suspect.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaGong yooüòç

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaNot in the train, again..
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitatrain to busan 2 please üòÖ
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaall of you newbies are all about &quot;Gong Yoo the best blah blah&quot; just because he recently exploded with Train to Busan while the other guy in this film, Song kang ho is out  of your knowledge, the best korean actor ever. he is the best ever i&#39;d say in Asia at least. i watched 80% of all his films and i&#39;ve never seen anyone like him. do not get me wrong, gong yoo is good but there are more better korean actors that can play his part in train to busan and do better like Lee byung hun, Ha jung woo, Ryu seong ryung, cha seung won and many more to mention!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitagong yoo is really good actor ... I like him for his movies
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaHi everyone, I watched the movie but could still not figure out who actually was the person who snitched on the train journey of the Korean resistance fighters to the Japanese. Anyone paid better attention?
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI want to watch this movie. I am confident in the works of Director Kim Jee-woon.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaGong Yoo is just getting better and better...and better!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI love Gong Yoo, so good to see him showing his awesome acting in an action film!!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaSomething about this film felt off and unfinished. Great cinematography and acting nonetheless!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaWell it has song Lang-ho in it so I&#39;m in
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaoh goddd song kang ho, gong yoo, lee byung hun and kim jee woon !!! i can&#39;t wait!!!!!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitajust saw this last night. Other than Song Kang Ho&#39;s brilliant acting, the flick was an overall disappointment. There were key major flaws in the train scene.. and Gong Yoo&#39;s performance was subpar at best. The chemistry between the two main roles just wasn&#39;t quite there. Also, the plot of the flick is somewhat controversial in the sense that they were portrayed as heroes but in reality they could also be seen as modern day terrorists with a good cause.. if that makes any sense
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaAPPA!!!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitamy yoo gong is back!
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaüòçüòç

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaDuring the japanese colonial time, the corrupted government decided to just abandon their county. However, the Korean militia did not give up and kept fighting until the end, which resulted in positively.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaThis cool guy from Coffee Prince just did Train to Busan and now he&#39;s got a new film coming up? Awesome work, Ajussi!

zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitawow! Korean movie by Warner Bros
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaSimilar name to the Sherlock movie. On a train like the Sherlock movie. The scene where they&#39;re running through the woods like the Sherlock movie. Director of Bittersweet life? Will watch
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshital must see this film.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is being chosen as South Korea&#39;s Oscar entry for Best Foreign Film so you already know this movie is amazing.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitahe&#39;s on a train again, probably bound for busan
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaI. AM. IN.
zoYsQcGV4b4delimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome,from the makers of those movies,count me in,you know it&#39;s gonna be a great film
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve never seen them try to combine Action and Disaster before. Partially because it seems like a really bad idea.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitathe volcanic eruption was extremeley exaggarated
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like Dante&#39;s Peak had a baby with Gladiator.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaNeed to see this!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaid pay 15 buck to see it in 3d
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaso this is basically the Titanic movie of our time... have a romance and conflict story in a real life event.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhy do the Romans always have British accents?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know what Pompeii was like but I already know that this historically incorrect
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI just want to see this because of Emily Browning.... ;)
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaURM I CANT WATCH THIS BECAUSE DOCTOR WHO AND STUFF ITS GONNA RUIN IT YEAH
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitacalling it now the black guy dies.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaTalk about over the top. Goodness.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaMy only reaction was: No. Your name is Jon Snow.¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaRun you fools! ( Gandalf voice)
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaHis name is john snow! i&#39;m pretty sure the black guy is gonna dye
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TRwfxDICM&amp;t=0m36s">0:36</a> My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, General of the felix legions, Loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus¬†Aurelius, Father to a murdered son, Husband to a murdered wife...And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next...or something like that lol
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaSeriously? We can&#39;t have a Roman themed movie without freaking gladiators now? You filmmakers do know they weren&#39;t actually that big of a deal in real life, right?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s ghost, Jon?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita2012 but the B.C version b#@%!es
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaMr. Eko!! :D
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWell that was unexpected
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert they all die 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJohn Snoooo! 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitayou know nothing Jon Snow
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaBoring<br>.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitalol ohh john snow....your failing 1 movie at a time....
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaNice.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how it will end
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhy does this seem like titanic?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaTOO SOON ITS STILL A TOUCHY SUBJECT¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaso they battle a volcano in 3D? i hope jon snow is shirtless 90 percent of the movie...
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaE il dottore? 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaE il dottore? 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaEXPECTACULARRRRRRRR
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitatoday
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitai learned about the volcano vesuvios
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitano milla? weird considering this is Paul WS Anderson&#39;s movie
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s 2012, but set in ancient Rome. ¬†Alright. ¬†Has Hollywood run out of ideas for modern disaster movies, and now turns to disasters of the past to cash in on?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Pompeii in 3D&quot; Is the &quot;in 3D&quot; part of the title really necessary?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaaka. Jon Snow The Movie.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaOh, cool. John Snow on the big screen. I might give it a watch.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI think it&#39;s gonna be Prince of Persia and The Scorpion King all over again ^_^ lol
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWell this is gonna suck
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie doesn&#39;t have the song by Bastille in it, I will be thoroughly disappointed¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaVOLCANIC ERUPTION!... and¬†a plot in there... you know,¬†somewhere.<br><br>Now in 3D!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaIn The End, they&#39;re all fucking DEAD!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaThe HELL is this? &quot;WHO WILL SURVIVE&quot; ...really? ¬¨.¬¨
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhat are you doing Jon Snow?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaYou know nothing Jon Snow.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TRwfxDICM&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> official¬†black guy dies
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJon Snow, high as fuck. Not protecting the wall and shit. 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaThe human side of the story fails to grab me and it gets washed out by the destruction and mayhem rather than being enhanced by it.¬† The actors look bland and fail to grab me in this two and a half minute trailer.¬† I won&#39;t be bothering.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaThey made a movie about that!? Seriously!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaSo.... it&#39;s Gladiator meets Dante&#39;s Peak? ¬†Hmmmm
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita&quot;You know nothing about geology, Jon Snow.&quot;
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaShhh! NO ONE tell me how this movie ends....I want to be surprised just like for Titanic and Romeo&amp;Juliet.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaYou know nothing! jon snow
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaAhh, so you&#39;re Ned Stark&#39;s bastard
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJon Snow<br>Wat R U Doin
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJon Snow :p GOT background theme... movie trailer sucks :(
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaYou know nothing, Jon Snow.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaGladiator +¬†Volcano ?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaPum Pum Putum PAM! huoh.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitawow.....they want me to see a movie to see a volcano do what volcano do yay sony ......st8 face (-_-)¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJon Snow and a girl from Sucker Punch lol
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita&quot;you know nothing john snow&quot;
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaRyse Son of Rome movie? and by sony?¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaoh dear
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaDamn Jon Snow! You&#39;re hot!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitayou know nothing jon snow...¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaAnachronisms, historical inaccuracy, forced and heavily troped plot with token black warrior bro and silly romance, British accents and the fact that Jon Snow gets to keep his fabulous hair, thumbs up for a movie about one of the coolest lost cities of all time!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaA Stark hmmm...Now this will be interesting
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaYeh games of thrones actor!!! 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshita¬†Pompeii was a big SEX city.¬†¬†They even had penises engraved in the cobble stones.¬†¬†¬†Italy actually covered up a lot of the art so that tourists wouldn&#39;t be offeneded, just recently in the last 5 years or more did they start to uncover the original art and talk about all the Sex going on.¬† Some of the paintings are down right dirty!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaSo now Jon Snow is wooing other red heads, half naked and fighting warriors, clouds, fireballs, volcanos and water?¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaguessing it to be Gladiator + 2012!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaIts like watching Titanic...the whole movie you&#39;re going to be like...wait for it, wait for it...
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like the resulting action of shredding the scripts for¬†Armageddon and Gladiator and then trying to glue them back together as one. Watching it on DVD will probably suffice for me.¬†
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! ... nicely processed<br>volcano eruption = The city is much devastated<br>gladiator =¬†part of the age<br>caused by the movement of tectonic plates¬†(is responsible for the eruption of a cataclysm)
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie last night. Everyone dies in the end.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhere is the Doctor?
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaOk! This doesn&#39;t look bad! It looks like it&#39;s gonna be slow at first until the volcano erupts, but I might actually give this one a chance.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWOW...this is beautiful trailer
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaNow that i have seen all the money shots i don&#39;t need to go see that movie. 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaemily is a goddess &lt;3
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaNice try...
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaBloody hell, more gladiator glorification... -_-
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaLook good 
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitasean bean dies at the end
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaI was there
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaJon Snow...you really do know nothing
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWOW O_O
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaWhat are you doing John Snow? Wrong show! I mean movie
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaLooks dope but JESUSSSSSSS they sure showed a lot.
t6TRwfxDICMdelimeterByIshitaVery nice special effects, excited!!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaFantastic!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaMy bad, I must&#39;ve forgotten and got confused and mixed up that part. I got the impression it was empasising that it did, obviously my brain is remebering it wrong. Thanks for clearing that up for me :)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIs it really necessary for Ang Lee to demonstrate technically poor CGI again?
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s an entire subplot at the start of the book that emphatically states his name does not contain the pee phonetic.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t wait for the sequel: Life of Butt
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaits richard parker :)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s called Richard Parker (long in-joke in the history of books about castaways).
And in a certain sense, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; *IS* Castaway on hallucinations. :D
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitais the tiger called Wilson? If so, this looks like Castaway on opium.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaPrepare for two hours of poorly done green screen. In my opinion it should have stayed as a novel.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaLooks beautiful x
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaits actually about canabalism
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaLooks spectacular. The book is one of my favourites, and this looks like it may just do justice to it.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai just saw something beautiful today
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaim hold my beloved cat so tight while watching this trailer..

3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshita Ang Lee, man. He is a wizard. 
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so beautiful and majestic!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitawatching any movies:

friend, loved person or family die - meh
animal die - crying a loud
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai read the book
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t read the book

kid + tiger + boat = epic
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaWow Just Wow!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaPi = 3.14 

3 = You
1 = I
4 = LOVE

You and I are gonna love this trailer :)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t exactly by the novel (which I loved)...looks like it could be pretty dang good though, as long as they don&#39;t kitty-ify Richard Parker too much
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaamazing!!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m stunned by the visuals. Now the real question is, can it be as emotional as the book?
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaawesome..cant wait
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitathe whale is so beautiful
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaHe IS the tiger. It&#39;s a metaphor. And he hallucinated like crazy out there.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThis is going for OSCARS !!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaI am ridiculously excited about this.
  Does anyone know what the music is? It&#39;s stunning.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThey better be, all the news sites keep saying the film is about a boy and his tiger. The interactions between the animals make this story what it is.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitathat isn&#39;t what it seems ;)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaFor anyone who&#39;s read the book (read - half the target segment of the movie) this trailer is pretty much as good as the movie.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitawoooow, magical...
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaYou see the cheetah @ 1:21

I imagine the rest of the animals are in there.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThe book was magnificent, and this adaptation looks just as spectacular. Can&#39;t wait.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai can already tell what my favorite scene is gonna be. but when he watces the ship go down- so sad :(
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaHahaha now that would be one hell of a twist.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaÂè™ÊòØÂú®Âè∞ÁÅ£ÈÉ®‰ªΩÂèñÊôØÂíåÊê≠Ê£ö....‰ªçÊòØÁôæÂàÜÁôæ HOLLYWOOD MOVIE!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand why trailers put spoilers in them. Like the scene where the guy is crying while petting the tiger. Guess why he&#39;s crying.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitasuddenly felt something salty rolling down my cheek
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitacuz tigers are awesome
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaRead the book and it&#39;s amazing.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaGive this trailer a 3.14 out of 5
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitajust like Marley and Me THE TIGER DIES
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaEver since I read this book about six to seven years ago I&#39;ve always thought somebody should make it into a movie.  Hope its just as good as the book.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai thought this was the jungle book
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThat is one feisty moofin.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIndia  dumbass
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitadafuq is this shit
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIt is pronouncec pee not pie by the way, so the Pi jokes are irrelevant. Also where are all the other animals?
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitawhy do the stairs sound so loud when he&#39;s barefoot?
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitai like the video very much.wow....
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitawow.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitacan anyone tell me where to find the music started from 1.16?? 
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaIt looks way too 90&#39;s Disney to me.  The book wasn&#39;t like this... 
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitareminds me of castaway
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitathe amount of CG in this movie is over 9000!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaYou should try to read the book first. You&#39;d understand. (Or not.)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaSO DEEEP
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThe tiger is both a mix of a real tiger and cg...
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitawtf this is stupid fucking fantasy movie, really disappointing, i don&#39;t know about the books or whatever but i&#39;ve been waiting for this because some peoples talking about ang lee new project and i thought it&#39;s drama movie
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaMust See!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll definately watch that!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaThe visual effects are some of the best ive ever seen im intrigued i must see more of this movie
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to this !!!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitathe trailer could have lasted for 3.14 minutes :)
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaRichard Motherfucking Parker, bitches.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaSO AMAZING  !!!!!!         
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaPi IS EXACTLY 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaWatching this trailer in 3D will already be more spectacular than most full-lenght features in cinema&#39;s. Wow. 
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaCalm down People! The tiger is neither real nor CG, He is a figment of your imagination.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitalooks like a great story
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaDamn, I thought it was going to be a movie about maths..... :(
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitayeah man i miss the days when they would actually get real whales to jump over people and have real tigers right next to actors.
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaso mowgli is getting friends with shere khan eh?

3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitano way this is CG....
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshita@Killebillagain.. ya even my friend told me same thing that some computer graphics thing. But the tiger is so realistic, can&#39;t believe it . 
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitalet&#39;s wait for the making of the movie or something.. maybe that will settle this argument.. for now i am just amazed at this amazing work...
3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaREAD THE BOOKS, KIDS. THE BOOKS, KIDS, ARE ALWAYS BETTER THAN THE MOOOFIES, KIDS

10/08/90.

3mMN693-F3UdelimeterByIshitaDude its CG tiger.. how can he dare to let tiger sleep on his lap..

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitait all started with alice then chris now leon links from the game into the movie awesome &amp; theyve brung bak the movie characters back to life thats insane.i wonder how it ll end though no spoilers pls i dnt know much about the RE: series but im learning enough this is the year for CAPCOM &amp; SONY nce again cause of Resident Evil 6,RE:ORC &amp; Revelation wow its collistion isawesome!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaWesker is still a douche bag.
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaDid you guys see that giant Licker? This will surely be worth watching while waiting for &quot;Resident Evil 6.&quot;
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a film that was very successful like the game. Few achieve it. Even people who don&#39;t know &quot;Resident Evil Game&quot; like &quot;Resident Evil Movie.&quot;
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaWHY DO ALICE HAVE LOVE AFFAIR WITH CARLOS?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitalooks epic!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitathe story seems confusing. what the?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaThey really should stop picking random characters out of the games (like Ada Wong) You can&#39;t just take a character and throw them in randomly just because they need something to fill out the story a bit -_- I loved the games, and the books they made from them BECAUSE they followed the same story line 
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshita1:50
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitais that Leon?! :D :OOO 1:50
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaI loved part 4, Mr. Anderson bring NEMESIS BACK! whit all the mutations!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaThe movies are based in the &quot;world&quot; and some of the characters from the games, please dont fuck with &quot;aooo WTF this not resident evil (games)&quot;, think like is other dimension or other fucking world, if they had ALL the game&#39;s characters, would complain that they are not equal and other shit, please dont want a game to movie of RE,i like this movie because is a different way to see resident evil franchise but YES! continuity,is a joke
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshita0:58 her daughter is designated as a &#39;clone&#39;. odeh,the captain from the 1st movie,jill and rain are all against her. in the teaser trailer the people are from the cities captured by umbrella.leon,the basketball player,ada are with her.there&#39;s a zombie using a chainsaw.THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME! :barneyvoice:
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaThis should be the most complete with it having Ada as well as Leon and whoever else is in it. GAH I&#39;M EXCITED :D I don&#39;t care what people think they can have their sparkly vampires and we&#39;ll proudly have our zombies lol.
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshita@1.50 Leon ?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaI literally jizzed everywhere watching this!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaThis is WoOoW. I Can&#39;t wait to see it in 3D 
it going to be awesome Ô£ø

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaAlbertino (L)
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaCarlos Oliveira is Back?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshita:o I&#39;m more excited now than I was when I saw the first trailer. So everything that ever happened was used against her. All those people she worked with like Carlos and Rain where either not real or used against her??? 
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaSo none of the other films happened? So confused right now...
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitais Ali Larter still in this movie? 
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaMUST WATCH! MUST!

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaSo leon grew a beard... It&#39;s kinda annoying when they do there own things making movies based on games, do it with books.. not games.. but they can do whatever the fuck they wanna do
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitalol no i didn&#39;t, dang
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaIf they&#39;re REALLY rebooting this and making everything from the beginning fake its the best thing that could happen to the series! The previous movies have been fun... but nothing after the first one has been &#39;Resident Evil&#39; - now we actually get to have a RE movie again!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaYes. This is going to be so awesome. Can&#39;t wait!!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaDid I just see Jaime Lannister at 1:50?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &quot;all 4 prior movies were a dream&quot; reboot, as some people say.

I think &quot;Never existed&quot; and &quot;It was all imprinted&quot; just refer to the beginning of the trailer. Ya know, Alice living with Carlos, having a daughter. Why don&#39;t people see this? If she did really live with Carlos, it would contradict details in the first and second movies. ...Unless they&#39;re clones...
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitain game he looks gay too¬¨_¬¨
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaSo , apparently , everything that happened in the previous movies was just a simulation. ( ? )
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaILove this..

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaÂ§™Ê£í‰∫Ü!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaits movie 2 of the second triology.....one movie comes out after this one
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t care what anyone says. This will be amazing. 
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitano mames leon its going to be in tis movie
wooooooohhuuuuuuu!!!!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it will be the best RE movie. Everyone is here. Its no longer in one boring place, its everywhere, and the story basically rebooted since apparently nothing in the past 4 movies was real. Holy God, this will be amazing. Hopefully they don&#39;t screw up Leon.
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaada wong is sexy :P 
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaseriously?.......its an &#39;all the previous movie&#39;s were a dream&#39; reboot?
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaIm so disapointed that they would add Leon in here but make him not a big character at all. Injustice to RE2/RE4 big time....

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaSick and Epic !!!!!! Luv Alice and Rain!!!!
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaOMG *O*
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitagreat ....

hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaFUCK !! LOVE IT :D
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaAIda Wong  does not look nothing like the original
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitada faq is this?! :/
hoyMT-7wEqsdelimeterByIshitaJILL VALENTINE IN A RE MOVIE

GHlwRsl2uFkdelimeterByIshitaJuniper Lee: The Movie
GHlwRsl2uFkdelimeterByIshitaFirst
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaI liked Will Smith before I saw Seven Pounds. Then the movie started and Ben, the character Will plays in the movie yells and berates a blind beef salesman over the phone.  I was horrified by the scene and felt horrible for the salesman. <br>Then I watched Seven Pounds,  the movie Will Smith was born to play. He plays this character so well I wanted to be him.<br>Not Will Smith,  but Ben Thomas, the <br>NOT IRS agent.
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshita7 is known as a lucky number.
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaI wish there was a happy ending...
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaThe piano sc√®ne when Will watches at Woody while playjng the piano, is such an eyeopener.
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshita&quot;In seven days, God created the world. And in seven seconds, I shattered mine.&quot; Yep. That&#39;s about how long it took him to walk up on stage and slap Chris Rock.
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaWe have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory sin is terrible because of sin we are separated from God but gladly here is the good news Jesus Christ came and walked this earth for everyone taught us the perfect way to live and how we should live and he died for our sins because we need a sacrifice to pay the price for our sins since our sins deserve hell if we live in sin but also more good news Jesus rose from the dead three days later we have to leave the sin behind and put it away and live new with Jesus this world is like a vapor it passes away but your eternity is forever and it is up to you what you want to do with it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when it came out and from what I remember I was a mess after it. This and the pursuit of happiness I don‚Äôt think iv ever watched again. May have to revisit them again
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie I put this movie up there with Titanic the end was sad and good at the same time.
zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!

zdMpeO5G4OQdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t watch this.. To many good people that suffer through life because of an accident and the evil around us consumes us into sadness.. Fear and Sadness is there knew sunrise no light just dark fills the view.

EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaDorkly&#39;s The Koopa king&#39;s speech brought me here.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaColin Firth is amazing actor I don&#39;t have any word to explain how amazing he is
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t like
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t see the queen mum as anyone other than Victoria Hamilton üò≠
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaKind of crazy to think a man with a stammer and one of the greatest orators of the twentieth century led Britain through world war two.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitathe funny part is the end they make it sound like the King didn&#39;t speak German. He was actually fluent - as his brother King Edward.  His both parents spoke German - and his mother actually spoke English with a German accent.  King George VI was actually born with a German name - and I think he changed it in his teens.  <br><br>I love how the British love to re-write english.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaHere&#39;s the twist....<br>Captain Barbusa help the king cure his stuttering.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitathe teacher also comes out on the crown the teacher that teaches prince charles how to speak welsh
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaHow are speak english guys? ƒ∞m turkish so im havent perfect english
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaAye captain Barbosa
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here because of my activity in my module ü•≤
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitai like this film
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaisnt the queen 1/16 german and can speak german so why cant the king
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a stammerüôÇ‚ù§
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshita<b>I wish I saw this sooner</b>
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI also stutter , people make fun of me at first but as they get to know me, they stop laughing ... It&#39;s really painful , This movie was for me but I&#39;m not from Royal Family
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece I am glad I watched it outstanding performance by Colin Geoffrey Helena and director amazing
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaStill bugs me Helena B Carter never won any Oscars.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaActually it&#39;s all that it takes for an introvert - just speak and with every word you become stronger, but we tend to stay back at times, because we realise what&#39;s the point and who cares anyway. Overall it&#39;s all about talking with yourself. It takes time, it takes sanity and makes you drift between strange places in your own mind. Stay strong &lt;3
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not English, but This movie made me love Berty. Its absolutely one of my favourite movies.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaHarry Hart as King George the 6th <br>Bellatrix Lestrange<br>Captain Barbossa <br>Peter Pettigrew <br>Professor Dumbledore <br>And the The Mandarin
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s captain barbosa.... holly molly
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaSo basically we&#39;re suppose to be cheerful that this man conquered his impediment and was able to send young men to die in a fruitless war?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaHelena became queen mother on this movie, and she becoming as Princess Margaret at The Crown.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaBest movie ever made &lt;3
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThe Queen Mother become Princess Margaret on The Crown
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s queen Elizabeth 11 was she born yet or what
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaMade by peedos,  acted by peedos depicting peedos.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaTHERE IS ONLY ONE TRUE KING AND THAT IS OUR SAVIOR JESUS (YESHUA) CHRIST. NO OTHER KING OR GOD BEFORE HIM. PEOPLE ARE FOOLED STILL. THINKING THIS IS AN UPLIFTING MOVIE, WHEN THIS IS PLAIN BLASPHEMY. MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOU.üôè # JESUS IS KING!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaWho else had sweaty hands throughout the whole movie?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s something about the British
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitalol i thought this was a prequel of the kingsmen series
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitai didn‚Äôt watch the movie üò¢

EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaPlease tell me how to overcome stuttering
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaGeoffrey Rush and his voice.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitacaptain barbossa
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaVery good movie!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaNetflix where is it
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaEven though the stories are quite different. This movie always reminds me of My Fair Lady
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitawho have link this full movie?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshita&quot;Timing is my strong suit&quot;
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis was the most beautiful movie...

EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaVoice of king........
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaFyi for any Harry Potter fans,  Bellatrix, Dumbledore and Peter Pettigrew are here in this movie. üòÇ
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaYUH BHA BHA BHA BHA YUH BHAA BHAA YUHYUHYUH BHA BHA BHA - D&#39;elia.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshita–§–∏–ª—å–º —Å—É–ø–µ—Ä!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI had a stammer
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaBellatrix Lestrange, Albus Dumbledore and Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail) are in this film
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaAm Here because Iam read book Oh su Hyang
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaLol! I loved it when Firth ask&#39;s the doctor  what he&#39;s charging for this; and the doctor says: a fortune!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who watched this first and then the Netflix series, the Crown?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaInception should have won that year
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody recognize the music from 2.15 to 2.19?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis is a Great Movie ! Worth to watch again and again
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThe second biography trailer I`ve seen with King George VI showing clips of Adolf Hitler since Darkest Hour. Kind of ironic.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaJust as well I heard Colin Firth clearly went all-out to knab his first Oscar for this film.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThe retard the declared war on germany and brought us the mess we have today
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcxBrTvLbBM&amp;t=1m49s">1:49</a> Elizabeth: What he say
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaMy stutter has always been my biggest enemy. The most douche bully I ever met was myself thanks to my stutter. I hate what my stutter has caused me and I still would sacrifice my only wish if I ever got one to get rid of my stuttering. Not trillions of dollars. Not the most beautiful girl. Not to be able to fly.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThe fact that they cut out the stutters on the trailer is pretty gross.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaRemember this is directed by the same person who directed Cats.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshita... This film had so much impact on me, I too suffered from the same condition.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaWho else have goosebump all the way throughout the trailer? Definitely a MUST-WATCH!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaAnne boleyne is immortal
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitamy favorite movie ever .
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaHelena Bonham Carter is magnificent in this film.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis is a great companion piece to watch before or after season 1 of the &quot;The Crown&quot;
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis was a fantastic movie
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaWhat a good cast!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis actually doesn&#39;t look like trash
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI was reading the book serie &#39;&#39;Her royal spyness&#39;&#39; and in the nineth book or so there were hints on this second son of the king, the only one who seemed well behaved and comitted to his family, but overlooked and harshly reprimanded by his father for his stutters.. Now, i&#39;m reading the book where i suspect the heir David is planning to marry secretly , in italy, his, rather old and rude, twice divorced american ladylove..highly inpressionable, he seems , like his ladyfriend, to develop a fascination for Hitler&#39;s ascension to power.. I suspected he may be forced by the royal family to elope..and it made me think of this movie..witch led me here. And it seems to be inspired, like the books, by true historical events..i&#39;m gonna definitively watch this later.<br>PS:i&#39;m north african myself and i wish our local film industry or authors could make our own history this fun and glamorous to read about.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitais this the kingsman guy?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaDude i M 13 i flippin stutter i wana this movie so bad
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaGuess who cried lmao
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI am stuttering, always been, and I know how difficult it feels when speaking in public makes the stuttering worse.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaSo Harry was king before Kingsman Agent.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaStuttering is a terrible thing, this movie portrays this disorder very well. I still hope that one day I can conquer it.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI will never forgive Tom Hooper for cutting Helena Bonham Carter&#39;s &quot;I intend to be a very good queen&quot; scene. That robbed her of her oscar.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaGeorge
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for Alexandre Desplat - he is a great composer and I love his Film Scoring !!
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaCongratulations podcast?
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaTo think this is the fourth time she&#39;s been queen! ( Lady Jane, Anne Boleyn, Red Queen and obviously The Queen Mother)
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaIt beat inception
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitai stutter too, but i&#39;m cool with it.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a masterpiece that everyone should see.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie over played his speech problems, the real George VI wasn&#39;t as bad as him in the beginning
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaJust saw this movie and i just want say that it is not only fantastic movie but it is also very inspirational movie for those who want to speak fluently in public without pausing. <br>Colin firth, Geoffrey rush and helena carter has done splendid acting in this movie i become fan of this three actor&#39;s and I&#39;ll watch more movie of this actors.<br>one more thing i want to add here that  I am indian and i am learning english language (and i love british accent) I want to speak english fluently without pausing in public, and I will be able to do this soon.
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitalike&#39;nt
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitadislike
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaExcellent film. Marvelous actors &amp; actress
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI don‚Äôt why but this movie reminded so much of Miss Congeniality
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI also the victim of spech disorder but this movie inspire me
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaI think there is too much spoilers for a trailer. Why should people watch after seen this much? lol
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has given me great courage not to live in fear
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaWe watched half of this today in class. We were using a projector and we couldn&#39;t close off the windows so everything was so dark and we couldn&#39;t see a thing. But I still somehow knew that it was helena bonham carter
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaThe speech therapist actor looks more like Albert than Colin does
EcxBrTvLbBMdelimeterByIshitaA truly great and completely uplifting movie.
