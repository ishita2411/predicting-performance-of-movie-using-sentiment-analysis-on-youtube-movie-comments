LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitadisrespect, one of the big troubles in the world. i heard someone in the supermarket saying to the female cashier &quot;you soup chicken&quot;.<br>the only truth is, Mark Zuckerberg would have acted more subtle than this Mark wahlberg, e.g. by directing a golddigger test
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI wish they ended the movie with the Gatti fight.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t watch this till 2018  always seen it around and had the dvd and kept putting it to the side and one day it was the only dvd I had left that I didn&#39;t watch and still hesitate to watch it and said the hell with it and I was like why the hell didn&#39;t I watch this sooner ü§£ it&#39;s a really great movie wished they would do a 2nd
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaWhat a messed up family this was, good movie not as good as southpaw but it was a good movie and it&#39;s a true story, that  documentary of Dickie really made him change his life around it&#39;s crazy because he was a dope fiend but he still will knock you out.. My favorite part of the movie is when he said &quot;I went 10 rounds with sugar Ray Leonard what have you done&quot; It really didn&#39;t matter if sugar Ray Leonard slipped he went 10 rounds with the champ!!!  I&#39;ll give this a 6 1/2 out of a 10 ..  I just love the plot man, I love how dicky tried to escape by jumping out the back window from his peoples, This movie is sad and funny at the same time.

LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI love that movie
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaTrash ass movie
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe this movie won Oscars and other awards. I just watched and I am not saying it is bad, but it is nothing special. The boxing scenes looked fake af.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaMovie sucked
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaMe and my brother  :&#39;(
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaProper great movie
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaAlright just watched the whole movie from this trailer
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaThere isn&#39;t a single likeable character in this entire movie. Christ on a bike, the only thing I was rooting for was the credits.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaHe is my moms cousin
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI watched the HBO documentary &quot;High on Crack Street&quot; and I showed the real Mickey and Dixie
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaMark wahlberg is such a bad actor, my god.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaname of the Music that starts from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRIZ4mCi5Ps&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> ??
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaIm a young boxer and i went to the west end gym where micky ward went they actully filmed where the gym was and the owner that i know was in a bit of the movie!!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaYou have the whole movie in this trailer:) Maybe they meant &quot;spoiler&quot; instead:)
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaIf you&#39;re wanna see this movie for action, dont, it is WAY MORE about the story. ( it is a bit boring movie )
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaNothing can even touch warrior.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita0.07 HAHAHA
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaMake your fucking videos available on mobilr
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaAn Amazing Life Story!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitahonestly, this movie bored the living shit out of me and i really dont consider mark an actor since his &quot;performance&quot; in lovely bones
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitanaww cause i saw the movie a couple weeks ago so I cant even remember how it went!! I was hoping someone on here would know the song or at least part of the lyrics... the soundtrack listing wasn&#39;t right either
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@lakers0304 fuck, me either. have you tried searching lyrics

LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@urmomzduz ahhhhh thanks MAN!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know what the song is called that&#39;s played at the end of the title fight??? Cant find it any where
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@KLINTENATOR I think it&#39;s WHITESNAKE. HERE I GO

LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@muzzammil9 Have you seen the movie the Machinist,,Bale was way skinnier,real starved..
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@Sosodeflol lol no it wasn&#39;t a serious question...
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@muzzammil9 I&#39;ll assume this is a serious question.  Like his other films, he lost a lot of weight b.c he&#39;s that dedicated.  No effects.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita2 people don&#39;t understand Walhberg&#39;s work and/or life.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitawhats that song that plays in the movie. one part is like walk alone, its his entrance song. tell me plz. Btw movie is bad ass, too bad they dint put gatti
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaWTF is with it turning to black?
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@tqliu except this is a true story
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaMickey Ward is a silent Hero for  New england. The best liver punch ever in Boxing
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitahow did they make Bale look so scrawny? He&#39;s suppose to be.. *gruff voice*.. THE BATMAN!
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaWOW, ROCKY MUCH????
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaGreat actors, but no thanks. This story and plot has been done to death.  Pass.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaLol casting christian bale and Amy adams to carry this sorry ass loser who calls him self an actor. yeah Mark wahlberg can&#39;t act for shit and everyone knows it.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita2010 to Christian Bale: it doesn&#39;t make you a deep actor to lose weight for a role that doesn&#39;t require it. Seek help.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitai find this movie really hard to get into just cuz mark walberg n christian bale look NOTHING like the real micky ward n dicky ekland?? who were legends from the trilogy bout with the late arturo gatti. gatti was murdered last year by his wife. but nvm that. their war was probably the most savage. the most brutal.most raw &#39;fist fight&#39; EVER in modern time! round 9 of the 1st fight was considered the &#39;Round of the century!!!&quot; totally a &#39;sight to be seen&#39; in the sport of boxing in modern times. 
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good...might go see it
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitachristian bale yummy buff or not
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@uberathlete If you want to see Christian Bale really thin, see The Machinist. He looks like a skeleton in that movie, which he did just before Batman Begins.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshita@oleHABSole Please tell me you&#39;re joking.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitalooks like I don&#39;t have to pay any more to see it in the theater, they just gave me the whole resume of it.... :-s  crappy marketing these days

LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaWow thanks for showing all the freaking movie its not a trailer its pretty much a resumer of the film lol
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaDamn is that Christian Bale? He looks freakin thin. What diet program did he get on?!?
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaPacquiao should&#39;ve made a cameo in this. That would&#39;ve been awesome! haha
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitadid christian bail get aids for this movie?
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaEpic.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie about a 30-year old athlete who gets his one last shot at greatness?

First football in Invincible, and now boxing in &#39;The Fighter&#39;, does Mark Wahlberg plan on making a movie about every sport out there??
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitawow batman is trainor now
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t even recognize Christian Bale. Dude&#39;s eyeballing the Best Supporting Oscar.
LRIZ4mCi5PsdelimeterByIshitasup rocky 
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaIndiana jones is barely old in this, they made a mistake playing the old card so early.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThis film is still enjoyable, even tho I know it‚Äôs bad  and silly. It was the first Indy film I saw as a kid and saw it first in the cinema with my grandpa.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitadvd please from Ben
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a shame the movie wasnt Even good
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThis is the worst movie of 2008!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitathis movie is gonna look so great after DIAL OF DESTINY comes out.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaAnd now we got a 5th one üò≠üò≠
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaIndiana jones Film&#39;s is the Best!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaHey everyone! The trailer of Indy 5 is finally here!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaWho here after Indy 5 trailer?
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshita&quot;Jumping the shark&quot; should be replaced by &quot;Riding the refrigerator&quot;.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaEntertaining but unconvincing...far below the high standard of Ind Jones and the Last Crusade
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaI love the fact that Indiana Jones and Han Solo are young and then return old.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThe best one in the series
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like Indiana Jones 4. It ruins a legend.<br>But Indiana Jones 5 trailer has a heart in it :)
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaWhy they have to rape indiana üò≠, I have not seen the movie yet.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaMusic: John Williams(2008)
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaI did watch first 2 movies when I was kid, didn&#39;t know that there is 3rd and 4th... well, it&#39;s time to watch it. :D
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThey raped him, they raped indi.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaNot the best indy movie, but still really entertaining
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThe Loving Memory of John Hurt 1940-2017
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaDamn yt mad at people, that&#39;s why they hide out fav clips.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so awful, it‚Äôs not even so bad it‚Äôs good like The Room, it‚Äôs just awful.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaPatreon Glorious Stranger
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaBest movie in the franchise
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaFifth one out in 2022 I got great names Indiana jones and the castle of fears or maybe Indiana jones and the spirits from the dead :). love this movie!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaLlma Z√©
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Krystal Skull<br>10th Anniversary 2008-2018
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaGreat editing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTJy1rFBtVw&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a>
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaIt‚Äôs a better movie than people give it credit for.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaDo wish Connery would‚Äôve said yes to being in this
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThe sequel is bad, but you know what, all 3 of the sequels are bad IMO
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaSo this is where the Prequel Haters went off to. I Enjoyed this growing up, because it was just More Indy
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movies - great 4K Steelbook Collection - great Price on Amazon France - 102.95 ‚Ç¨ - but Amazon Germany 139.99 ‚Ç¨ - incomprehensible!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie ‚ù§
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaWhatever people say, this film is wonderful
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaGet ready to see the infamous ‚ÄúNuke the Dummytown Fridge‚Äù scene... IN 4K!
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaCrystal Skull is still a better movie than A Good Day To Die Hard
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaSpielberg&#39;s heart just wasn&#39;t in this one. Despite that, it&#39;s still good.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThe first half of the film was very good, rivalling the others except Raiders&#39; opening, but thereafter it lost it&#39;s way. There were far too many characters in this one.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaÍ∞úÏ≤òÎüâÌïú ÏÑ∏ÏÉÅ.. Ìîº Îß∫ÌûàÎäî ÏùåÏïÖ..ft
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was an embarrassment.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaHands down, my second favorite Indiana Jones film! Last Crusade obviously being top billing for me. I really enjoy Crystal Skull, and this 4k remaster is shaping up to better than the original look from this trailer! X3
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the hideous cinematography/ color grading has been made more muted/ naturalistic in this. Looks a lot more like the other films now.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaA little too goofy in spots but not as bad as it‚Äôs reputation. Really wish they‚Äôd veer away from the family vacation vibe of this and Crusade.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaThis is honestly the second best film in the series.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaSteven Spielberg is the greatest director in &quot;the entire history of cinema&quot;...<br>It&#39;s unimaginable that someone who has made powerful films such as Schindler&#39;s List, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple (among others) has also directed exhilarating flicks such as Jurrasic Park, Jaws and the Indiana Jones tetralogy. <br>This man is incredible. ‚ù§Ô∏è
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaI love this film. I don&#39;t care what other people say. It gets too much hate. IMO it&#39;s better than Temple of Doom
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P John Hurt
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most disapointing movie of all time.
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaWow
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaMe: does this mean the other collections will be cheaper<br>Paramount: HahahahNO!<br>Me: WHY!?
kTJy1rFBtVwdelimeterByIshitaWow, the color timing on this is a huge step up from the old Blu-ray!
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI CAME HERE BECAUSE OF BEOMGYU.  üòè‚ô•Ô∏è
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just here to point out how fucking annoying it is to share this with an actual deaf person because it doesn&#39;t have freaking captions!!!!

zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaMy fav. Movie
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaCan anyone recommend me a movie similar to this one? I recommend you &quot;St. Vincent&quot; &quot;Wonder&quot; &quot;The odd life of Timothy Green&quot; &quot;All About Steve&quot; &quot;The Help&quot; &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot; &quot;The Blind Side&quot; are all feel good movies.
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshita‚ÄúYou what music is? God‚Äôs little reminder, that there‚Äôs something else besides us in this universe; harmonic connection between all living beings, everywhere, even the stars.‚Äù <br>-Robin Williams
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI get the ending and I loved the ending but I think it would have been better if they ended it with a family photoüò≠
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaMy childhood ü•∞üò¢‚ô•Ô∏è

zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaWhen this kid grew up he became &quot;the good doctor&quot; ....  Don&#39;t worry...he is still gifted though...

zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this movie today. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never seen it until now. What a wonderful movie.
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaa fun movie, you have to suspend your disbelief while watching it, and don&#39;t take it too seriously, its a fantasy with great music, and i like robin williams in the &#39;fagin&#39; of the kid buskers role.
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaStunning movie! If you love music in your soul this is a must watch!
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI noticed the the actor of Hawaii Five O is in here, they just had their last show and I tell you what I can&#39;t wait to see him in other movies. Aloha from Honolulu Hawaii
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaThis is the first time I&#39;m watching this movie, it just started and I&#39;m in tears.

zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so happy I found it again! I watched it when it came out and remembered the story but somehow the actors went out of my head (that probably means they are good!) I wanted to show it to my son. This is a great movie!

zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaUsed yesterday to complement review at Book Readers Heaven
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshita
zhpwjrbeoJQdelimeterByIshitaHermoso
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI remember this came out when I was 8 years old
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaAt first i thought it might something to do with King Arthur. Guess i was wrong lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitatopzera
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitamuitombom
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWhats this movie about
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI love this strange movie. It has this thing where it makes you feel like you‚Äôre a part of it
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what critics said, this movie was and still is very good.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI could swear it was called &quot;Ladies Under water&quot;
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaHey hey hey
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI knew it. Reggie was the guardian. Haha! Why can&#39;t they just shoot the dog? Lol <br>6/10 for me. Didn&#39;t like it that much. Low budgeted.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThe Watergate is a hotel or an office depending. Nixon read documents without permission in it. I grew up in peace temple and two Jewish friends from growing up have their social media as them walking away in blue. I met a version of her a decade ago at rattlestick. X who worked for a president watched the Village with me in a commercial theater once. Rattlestick is in the village in NY on Waverly. I directed a play called Waverly Gallery in DC earlier about alzheimer&#39;s, Jews and art.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is Fantastic <br>Such a beautiful story  ...
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI love her and this movie looks amazing,The critics know nothing
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaDafuq does it have to be a pool lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaIve been looking for this movie for a decade.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaFantastic film, terrible trailer. Just watch the movie it&#39;s worth it.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaOk the move suck!! Ok people!!! It sucked balls!!!!!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI thought silvertide was in this movie?
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaShe is the most beautiful ever
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI love this movie.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaNunca mais achei esse filme . Em nem um lugar . Cara eu quero assistir tanto . De novo
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshita&quot;narf&quot; &quot;scrunt&quot; &quot;tartutic&quot;...laughable gibberish. Paul Giamatti curled up pretending to be a little kid...comical. M Night Shymalan playing a character whose writing will change the world...ego stroking. This movie only works as an unintentional comedy
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis trailer advertised something that looked mighty entertaining and would have been a box office smash. <br><br>I saw the film and it was mainly a snooze fest and half of the time, it didn&#39;t even involve the Lady in the water, just the background characters. <br><br>Someone needs to remake this movie so it matches the trailer.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis movie is one of those movies that either you get it ..or you keep thinking about it
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitathis looks creepy af!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaSuch a bad trailer for such a great film...
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI love this movie ‚ô•Ô∏è
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThe marketing-a-fantasy-film-as-horror approach worked wonders with The Sixth Sense, but should not have been repeated with The Village and Lady in the Water.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaOnce again, an M. Night movie that&#39;s about one thing, but it&#39;s marketed as another.....
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaAll this time i thought it was a scary movie till i watched it and realized it wasn&#39;t lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaGREAT FILM!  In time it will be truly appreciated. M. Night&#39;s best film.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWhen I first saw this movie, the story line was a bit muddy, and still it doesn&#39;t make too much sense. Ok, so they are all from this storybook world, but it should show the world, explain how they ended up in our world, and why others don&#39;t want them to go back.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaHere from Recommended
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaBryce looks like Opie......lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie as a kid <br>I&#39;m just know finding out that it was marketed as a horror film
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI wanted to see her world
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaHonestly I LOVE THIS movie!!! Like I never saw the trailor but they just showed the best parts thats why it was misunderstood I think the whole movie was amazing <br><br><br>I like my own comment cause no one else will
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaAmazing classic. A+ grade / 5 stars.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI really like this<br> Movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaMeh.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaGreatest movie in the history of the world.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaYeah I don&#39;t know anything but it sounds like they should have changed the location to a &#39;&#39;camping site&#39;&#39; with a lake or large pond and the main character could be the forest ranger in the area investigating little mysteries in his spare time :D idk
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaYawn.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI remember seeing this trailer as a kid and seriously thought it was a horror movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI think M Night Shyalaman needs to hire better people to do the marketing because this trailer didn&#39;t have the same vibe as the actual movie which also happened to The Village.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôll bet that creature is the beast from ‚ÄúSplit‚Äù.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaAfter seeing this movie, I&#39;d spend hours just fantasizing about what the land she comes from and what it looks like.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve been looking for this movie ever since i remember watching it back in 2009 or so and ifinally found it this movie was extremmely fasinating to me cant wait to watch after download
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis is an unusual tale. I think of Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and the haunting ending. Maybe there&#39;s a strange vitality to the concept of eccentric companionship. Isn&#39;t that why we like comic book characters such as Aqualad (DC Comics), Catwoman (DC Comics), and Lucifer Morningstar (DC Comics)?
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaas ad as this movie was executed, I still fuckin love it
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece! A+ grade.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI just watched it for the fifth time, and I finally fully accepted it, enjoyed it and appreciated it.  Really a very unique, one of a kind movie.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI watched this movie when it first came out; I was ten, I only saw it once. Every once in awhile I&#39;ll have flashbacks of different scenes... I didn&#39;t know what was going on in the movie then, just thought it was hella weird but a little cool because it didn&#39;t make sense and I was a lil scared so watching this was a strange experience.... Why is anyone reading my comment about my memory... this is weird... what a strange reality we live in where I can share my memories with strangers. Helloooo people I will never meet, probably
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaPaul Giamatti&#39;s stuttering in this movie really annoys me. I have known three different people in my life that stutters, and not one of them sounds even remotely like him when they speak.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThey all cant b winners
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaüòçeyesü§¢
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaA part of that was quite funny.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaBryce is so pretty!!! Aging like fine wine she&#39;s even more beautiful in Jurassic Park! I love her!!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaGuys you should know that is not a horror movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis trailer shows the best parts lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitachills..
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshita2018
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaLo raro es que no se arrugue de estar tanto rato en el agua....
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI love this movie.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshita<i>i hear splashing some nights...</i> hahaha!! lol
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaLady in the Water is a good movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshita&quot;Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can&#39;t go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.&quot;<br><br>‚Äï Margaret Atwood, The Penelopiad
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWeren&#39;t it was called women in the water? And wasn&#39;t it released in 2005 ?!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWhats with all the praise lmao this movie blows
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaChrist, what a terrible film. Have you ever known such a level of horseshit that wasn&#39;t even coming out of the mouth of the President of the United States?
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI said, &quot;I found her first!&quot;
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI can remember the first time I saw this movie, in 2006. I&#39;m in Cape Town, South Africa, and was on a flight to London. It was a connecting flight on to the USA, with Washington D.C. being the next connecting flight before Florida.<br>It was around 2 am. I couldn&#39;t sleep. So, I was looking at the list of movies to watch. This one looked intriguing, and I never knew about this movie before. It left a lump in my throat, and the healing song gave me cold shivers. A case of doing that 21 km up in the sky, moving at 960 km/h.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaLow budget....good for a boring day....they never show her world.üëé
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitai never seen or known about this film, but this is one of the worst trailers ive ever seen<br>killing ALL suspense...lol. who approved this
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitathe worst Shyamafucklan movie
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaA GREAT film that I really enjoyed but Christ the trailer was misleading!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI unintentionally watched this in the theaters when I was very young because it was paired with Finding Nemo lol what was the theater thinking when they paired these two movies hahahaha
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie! Had no idea that the chick was Bryce Howard. I actually enjoyed her acting before she went all feministey.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaDAMNN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A LAKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOOO GOOD :(
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaShe looks like Jessica Chastain
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaAny similarities with The Shape of Water?
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaM. Night is just making fucking SUPERHERO/VILLAN UNIVERSE?!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaM. Night IS indeed a Genius. He just needs to stick with what makes him GREAT. How can someone who wrote, produced, and directed The 6th Sense be as bad as most people are making him out to be. [and he is no one hit wonder - Signs, Unbreakable, The Village, were all great movies]. As we can see by his last 2 movies, he&#39;s getting back to form... so rejoice. Yes, he&#39;s made mistakes in his field, but, who among us have not. Let M. Night be an inspiration; in that, you should just do YOU and not what everyone thinks you should do. Because if you can&#39;t be true to yourself how can you be truly TRUE to anyone else!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis film used to terrify when I was younger. I was too scared to go into the bathroom by myself for about a year.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWhat a terrible preview....Just like how bad the preview was for The Village....I hope someone got fired for this.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitamy favorite movie ever
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaM night shittylan always overrated. What a bullshitter writer.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaShould have been a fairytale rather than this
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI seen this in the theater and I loved it.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaamazing film with great plot . i love it
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitashe looks like Eddie Redmayne
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaA ONDE EU POSSO ASSISTIR ESSE FILME?? JA PROCUREI NA NETFLIX E N√ÉO ACHEI E NEM NO YOUTUBE
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaIs it a mermaid movie?
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaWhat a hilarious trailer.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaŸÅŸÑŸÖ ÿ≥ŸäÿØÿ© ŸÖÿßÿ¶ ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ ÿÆŸäÿßŸÑŸä ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ ÿ±ÿßŸäÿ™Ÿá ÿ≥ÿ™Ÿá ŸÖÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ÿßÿ± ÿßÿπÿ¨ÿßÿ®900000000000000
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaI never new that the laden the water was Bryce Dallas Howard until I saw this!
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaThis is where they went wrong. They tried to market it as a horror film when it was actually a fantasy film. It was a great film with an amazing story. People just expected something different and that&#39;s why they were confused. They pulled the wrong crowd for the film. They lured in horror fanatics when they should&#39;ve aimed for people who enjoy a good storytelling.
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshitaGreat movie, and great trailer... But somewhere between the 2, marketing got lost...
pKR1mfrfGAodelimeterByIshita&quot;What if Lady in the Water was a Horror Movie&quot;<br>That should be the title.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a simple boy, I see naked Loki, I Like!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaGreat!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaAs soon as I saw this I just had to buy the book aha
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitais there a book to this? if so can anyone tell me what it&#39;s supposed to represent? I&#39;d the plot a metaphor for something cause that&#39;s what it seems like
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaHomie needs to be in a full length F. Scott Fitzgerald movie
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaWhilst it was Tom Hiddleston that brought me to this movie, even without him it looks fantastic. Alas our local library doesn&#39;t have the book (yet has 4 others by JG Ballard) and I&#39;d love to read it ahead of the film.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaDredd meets Snowpiecer
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaOnly much later, as he sits on his balcony eating the architect‚Äôs dog, does Dr. Robert Laing finally feel at home‚Ä¶
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t how my mind pictured the highrise when I read the book, but I like this. I&#39;m super excited now.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaWhat kind of movie is this?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI saw this film at its premiere at the BFI last year and it is something unique and great, Heartedly recommend, and will be going again, as so much is going on I&#39;m sure I missed stuff. Epic, beautiful and twisted as f@#k!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaRather interested in Tom&#39;s BODYüòç
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaVery interesting and encitingly mysterious
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitalooks great
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI have no idea what this is, but I&#39;m excited to watch this! Oh &amp; happy late bday, bday twin!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThe description, be still my heart.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitawhy is Tom Hiddleston so beautiful?! üíû
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitahigh rise mw2
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaSong name please?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaAt first I was like &quot;Naked Tom&quot; than I was like this movie looks fantastic and the trailer gave me the chills.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaNo movie could be possibly be as cool as this trailer.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThe book was sorta &quot;meh,&quot; but I did think it would make for an awesome movie. Sure enough, this looks awesome. Fantastic friggin&#39; cast too.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaHave high hopes
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a great satire, like a sci fi version of animal farm
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaloki in the office
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThey keep spoiling the movies with these trailers.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaIf this isn&#39;t a metaphor for the 1%, I don&#39;t know what is.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaUfft~ Jejune static economic pie speciousness
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaCom Truise?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI already love this film
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaive got high hopes for a methaphorical move taking satirical jabs at the class system
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaYou had me at &quot;naked Tom Hiddleston on a balcony&quot;. ;)
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaHi
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaDamn so dis movie like the economy of America now?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaSo.. showpiercer except in a skyscraper instead of on a train
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThat looks really good! This is how a trailer should be !
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so fucking interesting!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s a real life version of Sword Art Online?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of snowpiercer
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Dredd.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so shocked this wasn&#39;t titled &quot;High Life&quot;... really?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitacool!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaLooks fantastic, hype mode on
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI will only see his movie because of TOM HIDDLESTON!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaCame to see tom hiddleston in a suit, stayed for the amazing trailer
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitalooks trash
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaLove it
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaTom Hiddleston and Michael Fassbender keep looking more and more like each other with each movie lol
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaawe... i mean this looks amazing but i thought it was going to be a series, that would be amazing
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitasnow piercer in a sky scrapper not a train
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaAll these music scores remind me of some 80&#39;s dancercise  videos like are they gonna bust out and start showing how to work my thighs to the rhythm of the beat???
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaHappy Birthday Tom Hiddleston!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaTom Hiddleston  is the best
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitavery interesting
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing, but is no one gonna mention that kick ass soundtrack?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaCom Truise, yes please. If you&#39;ve never heard of Com Truise, you&#39;re welcome.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis is the Jeb Bush of new movies, seems pretty good but doesn&#39;t seem to able to connect well with any audience
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaNice metaphors.  :D<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s always the quiet ones.  The people who don&#39;t say much in real life.  Or the ones living vicariously on the internet. (who then get stalked, harassed and silenced by trolls, stalkers and bots, but hey)<br><br>Point is, it&#39;s always the quiet ones with the strangest minds.  :)
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaYes yes, it reminds people of Snowpiercer, we know.<br>High-Rise: 1975.<br>Snowpiercer: 2013.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Gatsby
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaJeremy Irons? The guy who voiced Scar from the Lion King? Sold.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of snowpiercer
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitawow....just wow!!! hope it comes to Hong Kong.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaIheartLoki
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaIts like George Orwell and Stanley Kubrick had a baby and this was the result.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaLooks good however I hope they fix all the CGI in those opening few scenes. It&#39;s a little too video-gamey but everything looks pretty impressive. especially the composition
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks SO amazing! I&#39;m not sure though if I should read the book or not... It&#39;s premiering early in my city, so I&#39;m stuck in a tight situation
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaFuck me Tom.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitasnowpiercer in a building........
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaLooks mesmerizing. Have to see it! Go Hiddleston
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!! Another fascinatingly beautiful and extremely chilling trailer for Wheatley&#39;s latest. Looking forward.<br>P.s. A huge gift of inspiration to my latest film project!!!
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI liked Snowpiercer too
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaStop Retro dancing. The sound of the future is Com Truise - Data Kiss.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaCame for the Com Truise, stayed for the Com Truise
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaWow this looks Great.... Trippy but Great!<br>This Director should seriously do a Bioshock movie. This whole movie had that Rapture Vibe.... anyone else get that?
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaso it&#39;s like Snowpiercer but up-down instead of side-side
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI LOVED the book and LOVE their keeping the creepy/paranoid vibe the book had.

LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThe way he says &quot;I&#39;m a fast learner&quot;.. Sigh.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaI saw it at LFF right after finishing the book. Fans of the book will love this. It&#39;s a wild ride.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaLooks good, but seems similar to Snow Piercer...

LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer splattered my brain all over the walls.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaEven though this has that insufferable woman that played Peggy on Mad Men, I&#39;m still willing to give this a shot.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what song they used in this trailer? Kinda reminds me of Boards of Canada.
LKPghZ5cc_EdelimeterByIshitaMy interest in this movie is really towering.<br>You could say I have high hopes for it.

m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitanow 11/2020,¬†hello
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitacriminally underrated movie.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful but disturbing movie.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaDifference movieüßêüßêüßêüßê magic lover girl
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is most underrated movie...
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaStill the greatest movie of all time. A great story about loss, inevitability and acceptance.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaStill one of the best trailers ever made! The visuals, the cuts, the MUSIC! Perfect.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI never watched the movie. But I listen to all its soundtracks. They are so beautiful
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitawoest modit of a movie evwr clint manaell wass that wa nwwded
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie when I was rly little and have had vague memories of it and I can&#39;t believe I actually found it!!! I legit only had one actual slight memory to go off of and a couple vague feelings, I was starting to think I just dreamt about it.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaAre you serious anna gripentrog these kids are absurd Repubkican36 theyvcan only provide for the Bronx.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitawow, so rare, i saw this trailer lottt of times but with another music, with super epic electric guitars in the final scenes, first time i see this trailer with this tribal music, wow<br>this movie is a excellent one, but a bit complicated to understand, but great, i would like to see more scenes of rachel as queen of Spain and more of Hugh like a spaniard conquistador, actually he look like a real spaniard knight, i think a better edition of this movie would be super good for the movie itself, maybe thats why was so underrrated i think
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the only movies to make me feel like I was on drugs. In a good way!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaif you have nothing to do in this world and your internet is really slow you must watch this movie as it will have no effect on you. As Hugh Jackman will never die
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer itself gives me goosebumps ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThe dendrochronology tattoo was a nice touch
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaHas anyone seen &#39;The age of Adaline&#39;? I see the use of astronomy in storytelling and find it fascinating
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThe soundtrack came on at 6am when I woke up and I started crying reading the plot on wiki... seriously underrated movie
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaHugh wizzy?
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI hear Jack screaming in the background
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie at a time when I thought a lot about death and feared death. I identified so much with the main character. His pain and grief and his journey to enlightenment. I cried so much when she died. It broke my heart honestly, but the ending of the movie was so powerful and inspiring. This movie helped me so much to change my perspective about death. I still fear it a bit sometimes, but I don‚Äôt have the same anxiety thinking about it.<br><br>This movie is very clear in it‚Äôs message, but still leaves a lot of room for reflection. I don‚Äôt find the story too complicated or hard to follow either.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not very good at empathy, love and sorrow I guess. I&#39;m practical - I would&#39;a cut that tree down for firewood. A mans gotta survive.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaGot 58% rotten tomatoes guess they didn‚Äôt get it back then that generation was to close minded back then
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitai from tiktok
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaAvicii&#39;s favourite movie
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, just heard about it an hour ago. I love every one of you on this comment section.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThe part where he realizes. That He&#39;s at peace with dying gets me everytime! Such a powerful scene. üò≠üòñ
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is my favourite movie of all time! Every frame, every second is pure art. And it makes you think in the end. Darren Aronofsky, Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, take a bow!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaif you love The Fountain I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fall in love with the tv show The OA!!! please watch it it‚Äôs more than just a tv show it‚Äôs an experience
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaRachel Weisz would be my reason to watch it
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of movies that you just need to watch, it‚Äôs hard to put into words how powerful it is.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is not a film. It&#39;s a statement.<br>A simple and same time a complex statement.<br>Death is an act of creation.<br>When you accept it as it is , life starts there. For some it&#39;s a new start and for others it&#39;s just the continuation.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaEpic! Fabulous, Fantastic Movie. Definitely one of my favorites Movies.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaPure satanic theory in this movie, talks about the soul lives forever.. deception of the devil that was used on eve before the fall in Eden, by eating the forbidden fruit all humanity was condemned to suffering sickness old age and painful death . You shall not surely die. Reality, when the body dies, your soul does not exist anymore. Just as a dead fly or cockroach. An alive dog is mightier than a dead Lion.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitato this day I can&#39;t even hear about this movie without tearing up. it&#39;s hauntingly beautiful... it left me completely speechless

m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie change my life ,...14 years ago.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWatched this as a child had soooooooo many questions üòÇ
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is like a wonderful mix of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and What Dreams May Come
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshita.. you are on a quest.. follow hints and you will start to remember why you sent yourself on this state.. when you remember you will know.. when you know you will be born again.. and you will move on.. even if you dont belive you belive.. its the voice in your head thats talking you this.. Im just a rememberance for something you asked for long ago.. now ask yourself whos speaking in your head? how does it sound? is that your voice or mine? and if its mine how do you know my voice? are you reading or is someone speaking in your head? follow that voice in your head and you will get all the answers you need.. stay astonished and belive for it is real.. just like the voice in your head..
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece üëè üôå
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaMost critics didn&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s too creative and emotionally challenging for some people.  The Fountain is as beautiful as it is heartbreaking.  I love Aronofsky, Jackman and Weisz for making it.  I&#39;ve taken this road to awe every few years since the year it came out.  It makes me cry and value my wife with raw intensity every single time.  i just watched it again.  Excuse me while I go hug her.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaMy guy was in the Fountain and The Prestige in the same year? .how did he find time to make Origins Wolverine?
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaxibalba
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaEven the trailer gives me goosebumps because I know how amazing the movie is
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaOur bodies are trapped souls üíú
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaAcceptance and understanding of the soul&#39;s journey.<br>Just rewatched it, out of the blue had several scenes playing in my head.<br>Hugh Jackman delivered the most genuine, raw, artistic performance in it.<br>Was not so keen on rachel as izzi though. Few of her facial expressions made it seem the character was a manipulative narcissistic, love seeing tears of despair coming from the man who loves her so much.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is my understanding of it. There is no one reality. All realms are illusionary, all managed by unique ‚Äúlaws‚Äù of physics . We can ‚Äúwake‚Äù into the distinct realms, either carrying our struggles along with us or making peace with them. Non attachment to the illusion of the physical realms is the road to freedom, to a cosmic form of consciousness.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIs anyone else here after watching Bad Omens music video?  <br> <b>The Fountain</b>
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a masterpiece!  It will always be!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s clearly a Twin Flame love story .
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaExistence of movies like this makes me so happy. Thanks! A true masterpiece!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIMHO this is timeless classic which one can watch over and over again.<br><br>This film gets better with each viewing. The performances, the directorial choices and the soundtrack are a thing of real beauty. <br><br>I can safely say this is Aronofsky&#39;s best work till date. What people don&#39; t realise is that this is an actual love story with all the edges intact. Love can transcend time and space.<br><br>The same theme was repeated in Nolan&#39;s Interstellar (2014) albeit in a much more subtle and puritan way.<br><br>The Fountain is just a metaphor for defining the existence of a human life and associated elements. Life is everything yet it is nothing.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI think Tom the Space Traveller is Tom Creo himself from 2000 AD who either was cryogenically preserved or had finally discovered the secret to immortality with his discovery of a tree from Guatemala that renders cell regeneration, but was too late a discovery to give it to Izzi. So after half a millennium, he went on a quest to the dying nebula Xibalba as a symbolic journey to meet his death and be with Izzi, aka Queen Isabella I of Castile, forever. As mentioned by Aronofsky in interviews, &quot;death is what makes us human&quot;, and Tommy wanted to regain his humanity again by venturing into deep space and finally reach the Star of Immortality and merge it with the fabled South American Tree of Life to burst forth a new life, one that will never die (and essentially continue their romance for all eternity).
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaMy favourite movie of all!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThe shadow of the tree of life is the tragedy of the commons projected or received.  True life or false life.  Hell is as deep as you allow it.... maybe.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIn addition to everything else that is great about this movie, the soundtrack is stunning!
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaSo thankful there&#39;s still people like Aronofski that have the stones to make films like this
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is so damn good.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie about Wolverine and his issue about immortality.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaMan, this X-Men timeline is getting really hard to follow.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI gotta watch this movie
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWtf is even going on? I can barely see the screen because all the white lights
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWeird trailer I watched The Fountain in theaters (My opinion worst movie ever) I never owned the Fountain.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaThis is called the kalpavriksha tree i think
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaA masterpiece
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaif this movie isnt the greatest, i dont know what is...
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sad to read bad comments about this movie and sadly critics had destroyed it. I have lost a lot of important people in my life and the first time I watched this film cried like a baby, this is not a movie for everyone, but is a movie for people like us who suffered the lost of someone important. Pass through all the states you pass when the lost comes and in some sense helps to see life as a diverse cicle in which we all turn a part of everything in the world even you want or not.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaSalo ne firse pehle we Mera adha plot le liya...
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWatching this is probably the worst way you can waste your time.<br>Basically a combination of Esmeralda and a very low cost version of Interstellar.<br>Dont make the same mistake as I did and watch it while expecting the movie to eventually make sense. It will not.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaOverrated. Best part about it is the trailer
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s probably the greatest movie score ever
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWho tf wants to live forever anyway?
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaonly the ending was good in this movie.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaBoring
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaA beautiful film that deserves appreciation for its very existence.  A beautiful contemplative and visually stunning thing of beauty with the best score I‚Äôve ever heard.  Clint Mansell, thank you for the score.  It‚Äôs perfection.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaPossibly my absolute favorite movie trailer. Not a bad movie either :)
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the track/song/music starting at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8IlyFCbNZg&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> ?
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaFirst, this trailer is wonderful and movies of today could learn a lot from it. Second, this is one of the most criminally underrated movies of the past 20 years. And third, quite easily Hugh Jackman&#39;s greatest performance that many don&#39;t even know about.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t get this movie when I was a kid.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaBest film about the notion of EVERLASTING LOVE put on screen. Visually stunning. Hauntingly beautiful performances by the two leads and an epic soundtrack.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaIm sure this is good,but I still have no clue what this is gonna be about.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaoutstanding
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaSaw this on a recommended video, knew nothing of it, and loved it. Everlasting love. Rachel Weisz is hot as.....
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the most poignant, beautiful meditations on life and death ever made, forever tsinted because Aronofsky is a craven predator.<br>Go ahead, monster, sue me; truth is the only defense against slander/libel.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t seen this film but I know it&#39;s a great movie.
m8IlyFCbNZgdelimeterByIshitaDarren Aronofsky is a genius!

hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaSeems like this is more Helen Mirren&#39;s movie, but it&#39;s nice to see Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul and was that Barkhad Abdi? It seems like a solid thriller. I&#39;ll see it. I wish it had been more of a teaser though.

hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool. Will probably be okay but not great. Still wanna watch it. <br>Oh and please don&#39;t reference Stanley Kubrick.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaHellen Mirren in military fatigues.... STOP IT! MY PENIS CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaWow, this looks like straight up propaganda.  Seems Hollywood is wanting to help justify the US drone program, in light of the heinous leak that shows the drone programs massive failures.<br><br><a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers">https://theintercept.com/drone-papers</a>

hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitathis looks shit
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaTo fly mr.white
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaSeems to give away a lot, but I&#39;ll watch based on the great reviews it got out of TIFF. Also seems like people much prefered this over good kill.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the shortest full feature movie I&#39;ve ever seen! Only 2¬Ω minutes!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaLove Aaron Paul. Will watch this. But something that seems left out of the discussion in the &quot;propaganda war&quot; at least from the trailer and discussion I see is how even a pure 100% success only hitting the worst guy alone in his jeep terrifies people for the surrounding blocks. Even killing nobody to the people on the ground thinking &quot;that was close, could have been me&quot; are going to be more willing to take up arms against you.... These drone strikes don&#39;t got jack shit on spec ops for target efficiency or the propaganda war. They should be extra eyes not god guns from the unseen skies.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaIslam is peace
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit this is the biggest pile of pro american war fare propaganda I&#39;ve seen in a while.<br><br>The truth? 90% of people killed from an American drone attack are innocent civilians. Source: <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/90-of-people-killed-by-us-drone-strikes-in-afghani/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/90-of-people-killed-by-us-drone-strikes-in-afghani/</a>

hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitai guess i will wait for the second &quot;need for speed&quot; movie
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see how you could compare this to Dr. Strangelove...
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaSNAPE!!!!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaIn the real world, nobody cares about civilian casualties. Thousands of innocent people already have been killed by drones - and it doesn&#39;t stop.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaI liked this movie the first time it came out when it was called &quot;Good Kill.&quot;
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitathis isn&#39;t gr8 m8
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaAaron paul  is high even when flying the jet!! LOL XD
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaGood movie üëç
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaAVADA KEDAVRA SEVERUS!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitathey are phoning it in so hard in this lol
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaSNAPE! PROFESSOR FCKIN SNAPE! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOqeoj669xg&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a>
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaExciting!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaIts funny to see that politicians and military have morals...in real life they was gonna shoot this and drink a tea after that in the memory of the lost hula hoop!!!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaI want to call bullshit so bad but its a really interesting movie concept. +Aaron Paul needs a win.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaIronic, they speck of the terrorists winning the propaganda war, yet this movie screams it!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s your eye in the skyyyyyyyyy. He&#39;ll take a look.  he was a meth cook. <br>It&#39;s aaron paaaul now~
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaI want a little bug or a hummingbird drone with real time video transmission...NOW!!!

hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaYeah bitch&#39;s! This is going to be awesome!
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaTotal cancer, useless junk in world class.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaThis is great if only these kind of choices were this hard but seriously cmon its one girl.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaboring
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaThe movie&#39;s entire plot is faulty. You have bugs that can fly and are controlled by the now defunct Playstation Phone? Or robotic birds with camera heads? <br><br>BUT NONE OF THEM ARE WEAPONIZED? For that you need a classic military attack drone? You can&#39;t just fly the bird in and tactically take out the room? I refuse to believe we&#39;d develop the flying bug and not arm it with a stinger filled with ricin or some other poison! <br><br>This movie stinks.
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaProfessor Snape looks badass
hOqeoj669xgdelimeterByIshitaLol this is a joke in real life they would have bombed the shit out that place without any hesitation..

mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaDid not Understood this thing .
mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaI just rewatched this. I liked it the first time, I never understood why people hated it so much. Maybe it&#39;s not big enough for some people. Its a perfect followup to Casino Royale. It&#39;s much nuanced and dark than I remember. It feels very Ludlum-esque at time. Fantastic story and truly unsettling foes.
mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaIs that super posh rufus at 1.12?
mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaQuantum of solace is a good bond movie. There&#39;s a lot of action in it, and Daniel Craig makes a good 007.
mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaBond...... James Bond
mkLcEGMkGMsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was trash, but oh boy No Time To Die, Spectre, Casino Royale, and Skyfall were a whole lot better than Quantum Of Solace TBH

kU44N6MKG9QdelimeterByIshitaWell done, puts a realistic, modern day twist on the movie concepts of Nick of Time, Matrix, and IRobot. Bonus that (from what I remember) it is family friendly. Little to no cursing, not gory, no sex. Just heart thumping action from beginning to end.

hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI love Kevin he reminds me of Liam Neelson
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWow...so glad I didnt watch this preview before the film... Kinda gives the whole bloody thing away...
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaHere because of Danielle Panabaker.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI watched it today. Great movie.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaStoner movie.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI did background work for this film. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever work on the set of my favorite film.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshita&quot;An asshole&#39;s an asshole.&quot;
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaSuper cino
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAsking Alexandria anyone?
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaMasterpiece!! Reminds me of Hitchcock.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitabest 2 hours watching this movie i could not pause it
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshita<b>Hello</b>
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWonderful movie, horrible trailer editing.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGood cast, and great movie.  Costner is one of my favs and Demi Moore does good in this movie.  The daughter is also cute on here.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaOne of my favourites movies<br>have watched it many many times
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here because of Asking Alexandria lol
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitahorrible trailer, but the movie is pretty good
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWhenever William Hurt is named, I try to find John Hurt in the film, till I remember these are two different people.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitashit i thought william hunt is jeff bridges
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaOne of the best thrillers of the 2000s by far. So original and different, and Costner is amazing. If you&#39;re watching this trailer, just go watch the movie instead!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaso i hear they won&#39;t invite sir Costner to the play in Oklahoma? then we won&#39;t worry about the trial...i got something kinda personal to put in words, a few of them but im so hacked I cant really do it right now.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaLooks good..about to watch it...
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll be there in the morning, with a smile on my face....
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI think the original script was designed to make a t.v. serie, but at the end they decided to reduce it and make an 120 mins movie.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI dunno why the name Brooks is so bad; most porn stars are named Brooks, and now a movie about a serial killer. Of all people, Kevin Cosner? Who am I to judge.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaCrap movie.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaPretty good movie. Didn&#39;t think Kevin Costner could make a good serial killer but heck at the end I was kinda routing for him. I couldn&#39;t get enough of him and William hunt. Can&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t ever heard of it before it came on netflix recently.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaReally shit. I&#39;d still throw one up Demi Moore though.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitai only know about this movie cause the asking alexandria song &quot;hey there mr brooks&quot;
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaThe trailer is way better than the actual film!... Ending so lame (in my opinion).
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWhy am I just now knowing about this movies existence??? This movie is soooo good I don&#39;t really buy movies especially since I&#39;m a see it once done type of gal but this is definitely going into my movie collection!üé•üëç
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaSame here. Def not a Dane Cook fan by any stretch of the imagination but this movie looks pretty darn good ;-)
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGood movie. Good ending.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWhat a piece of crap this movie was. Another its all about Kevin Costner overacting. I think its funny they thought they would have a trilogy on this movie. Take out Costner, Cook and maybe it could have been decent at best.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshita10 puntos esta pel√≠cula. .
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaSB, Brookfield con escaner, y los hijos grado en finanzas.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaMr. √Ünglo superando a masones en el 2006; 2007 lo contaron. 2010 me internaron y farmacolizaron. 2014 me culparon de asesino como el protagonista.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaThey should have made a sequel.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaThey were going to do a sequal. I really wish they would! This movie was bad ass. I loved it! :)<br>
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI am not a Dane Cook fan, but he really nailed the part of the annoying fan boy who wants to be a serial killer. This film is pretty underrated and Costner makes a surprisingly creepy murder. Truly worthy of a rental, at least.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI liked Danielle&#39;s part in the movie
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI think they gave away the whole movie in this trailer
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaBest thriller of all time.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaHey there mr brooks XD
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaCostners best film in years.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGood movie, but weighed down by to many subplots. Costner was good(as always). Bill Hurt was awesome. Dane Cook did¬† a good job as well. Fairly original idea.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaNow watching this on Netflix UK
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaLil bit like Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Definitely gonna watch this! &lt;3 :D
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaDane was amazing in this. The pouting scene had me in stitches.¬†
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAnyone know where I can rent this? Or perhaps buy it? It&#39;s not on Redbox, Netflix, or On Demand!!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitathis happened to asking alexandreas brother he was the only 1 who survived you should hear the song hey there mr brooks
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI saw Kevin Costner&#39;s very good performance in Oliver Stone&#39;s JFK many years ago, therefore, I knew he was a good actor despite some of the cheesy roles he played in the past.¬† But his performance in Mr Brooks is masterful.¬† I happened upon this film whilst searching the TV listings for anything half decent but I did not expect to watch one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.<br><br>Kevin Costner&#39;s performance is understated and this makes the character he plays, the more frightening and compelling.¬† He is an ordinary man with an extraordinary secondary personality, he could easily be the neighbour¬†you see as a normal and affable part of the community.¬† Yet, he comfortably hides a most disturbing secret.¬† And the main character is wonderfully complemented by William Hurt&#39;s skilful portrayal of a chilling sociopath.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie . Worth every dollar
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaHarry Morgan (&quot;Dexter&quot;) Vs. William Hurt&#39;s character? Who makes a better &quot;dark passenger&quot;?¬†
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaMr. Earl Brooks
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaOne of my favorites!!! 
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAsking Alexandria - Hey There Mr. Brooks :D
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitalooks good, is even better
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaUnderrated Masterpiece
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaYa this does look good. Must give it a watch
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaMr.Brooks, Dexter &amp; Pat Bateman !
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI wonder if he likes &#39;Huey Lewis and the News&#39;.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaReminds me of Dexter
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWow, this looks really good! Gonna have to check this one out for sure!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAwesome movie!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaone of my favorites....
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaThis is a masterpiece
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaA/A 
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWow I&#39;m glad I never saw a trailer for this movie before I watched it. I think they left maybe 1 twist out
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitais it thriller? i need to know...
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaso underrated movie.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaevery movie Kevin Costner&#39;s been in he has done a awesome job somemovies suck what is awesome and if you haven&#39;t seen Hatfield McCoys yet do so epic
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitawhy do trailers spoil so so much of the movie their trying to promote ? 
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaLoved this movie, was really one of the best with costner in it. Waterworld and the post man takes top 2 for sure, maybe water world and this one is a tie. If your looking for a good movie check our monster with Christina Ricci
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI run a personal account, so the videos I upload all have to do with me somehow, and the account name is a moniker/nickname for me.

If names didn&#39;t mean anything, there&#39;d be no such thing as branding.  Since branding drives success and failure of the global economy&#39;s biggest players, names/images obviously do matter.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaokey, so u can only upload videos with mummys and people thats called john. 
it dosent really matter if he starts upload call of duty videos, its just a name.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaWhat?  I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t really make sense for a trailer for a movie that&#39;s from 2007 to be hosted by the user OLDhollywoodtrailers.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshita1,9k videos, with most old videos.. cut him some slack.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitasociopaths / psychopaths run banks. ;) 
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshita&quot;Hey There Mr. Brooks&quot; by Asking Alexandria brought me here :) i wanna see the movie!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitasociopaths run hollywood

hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaFuck yeah \m/
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitalol dane cook

hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaHey there mr. Brooks :D
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaGreat movie for a great actor.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaUnfortunetely after Dances with wolves, Kevin costner started being commercial actor, sorry but this is not a movie, this is a bullchit
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitakevin costner acting is epicc
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaThis was a good one. 
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaASKING ALEXANDRIA!!!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAsking Alexandria brought me here. I want to watch it now.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitathat dream in the end WOW, that was outstanding , awesome movie and extremely underrated !
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaDANE COOK!!!! i wanna see this movie now
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaI remember how excited I was after this trailer came out. The scene when they&#39;re laughing and that look he gives at the end. ...Yep, it did it&#39;s job.
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitathis film deserves a sequel
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaAn underrated, but terrific film!
hXfbVIFc6t4delimeterByIshitaChannel&#39;s called &quot;oldhollywoodtrailers.&quot;

Movie&#39;s not even a decade old.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaboy, after i saw him in the move TAKEN i offically decided i want him to be my daddy. haha
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaWhy is it that every trailer nowadays has a crescendo of sound then a second of quiet (maybe with a pucnch line) at the end then another loud bang. You&#39;d think they would try something new.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME....two of my favorite Irish male actors.Can&#39;t wait to see them on the big screen!!!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitahhahahahah .ayo i swear the government needs to employ liam neeson he finds people the government doesnt know existed...or cant catch...thats my dude right there i like all his films.. 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThere is no Martin Harris... He doesn&#39;t exist.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitai truly agree@findcodes hollywood been ran out of ideas im a writer and it funny how they wanna keep going in circles instead of venturing out into the world for fresh ideas.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaNo idea is totally original, I don&#39;t get how some people expect an entirely new experience when they go to the movies, nor how they can even enjoy them.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@hotrodangel1992 *Qui-Gon-Jinn
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who thinks Darth Maul could be this guy again... Yeah watch this trailer!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitathey try to &quot;take&quot; him, the euro&#39;s never learn from the 1st time.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaYES!! ive waited for TAKEN 2 forever now!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThe Net, The Game, The Fugitive, I&#39;ll stay home and watch these
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitai feel bad for Liam Neeson. Hollywood puts him in such unfortunate situations and he has to kick the planets ass to get things back. 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@TheReich3 Last time I checked Europe wasn&#39;t a country xD
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@wincodetalker you are right!!! 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s just Frantic + Bourne Identity
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitathe last scene looks like Kali...again :)
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad to see Liam Neason in another action movie. I loved Taken so I can&#39;t wait for this too.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson = Harrison Ford. You see Liam Neeson in a movie and IMMEDIATELY you know his family is fucked. Either his daughter is being sold into the sex trade, his wife and identity stolen, or his son dying on the road to Jerusalem. And if he has no family like in Star Wars he just gets stabbed to death. You see Harrison Ford in a movie and you know that within twenty minutes his family will be tied up and someone will eb shooting at him as he drives an SUV around, or is Amish.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaITS A NEW VERSION OF THE FUGITIVE =D
BUT THIS DOCTOR KNOWS HOW TO KICK ASS
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitapretty similar to the bourne identity by the looks of it
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@AndrewTraceur win lol
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThe only man to OD on chuck norris pills and survive
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaBeware how you use miracles. --
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@roscosity Dr.tran much? lol
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@smashnash26 agreed.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@gradeaaaplus 
only way that would work is if all his &quot;memories&quot; in the film are attached to events that could have been witnessed or photographed. He wont know that &quot;thing&quot; she likes.. lol
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaI swear if i watch this movie and it doesn&#39;t lead to WHY they chose to even keep him alive...i will think Hollywood really has no clue how to make a movie with a full plot line.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam&#39;s turned into a bad-ass in his old age!~
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@mistaken72 Fucking LOL
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitawhatever the story is, i think the ending will be that liam neeson is part of the organization that is trying to kill him, and he was supposed to kill the real Dr. Martis Harris but he switched memories because of the accident, just saying
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s My Daughter?: Part II
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaIs this the sequel to Darkman? lol
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitafor a second i thought this was a sequel to taken. 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitameh
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaWHATS HAPPENING, Oh yeah BRUCE LEE WAHHHHHHH
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@Cypherus21 Yes! First thing I thought of when I saw this trailer a couple weeks ago. I thought I was the only one who thought this!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitahow is it that every time neeson goes to europe the country ends up in a wreck!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaYEAHH LIAM NEESOn
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita*I* am Martin Harris.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not going to be another Bourne rip off. It has it&#39;s own unique plot. I agree, whoever he was before, it seems he was Dr. Whoop ass specializing in kicking ass. Looks good to me.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaI believe the actual title to this movie is, &quot;Don&#39;t Fuck with Liam Neeson.&quot;
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaclearly this is based from Dr. Tran when he had amnesia... :D
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaTaken 2 - Amnesia
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaStolen identity makes so much at the box office. Well... actually sequels makes so much more alot of money. Aahhhh eeaa ggggghhhhh Agghhhh ehhHH aghghhhhjhhhhhh
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitabourne identity much?
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitathere is going to be much owning faces in this movie
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@lekocafe agreed
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaAt 1:10 it looks like he is DEFINATELY walking with a purpose! A purpose to kill someones ass permenately..I would hate to be in Liam&#39;s Crosshairs lol 

Feb. 18th 2011 cant come soon enough! 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaEver since Taken..Ive come to highly appreciate anything Liam Nesson does..He is such a MONSTER! and I just realized about 2 weeks ago that he was DARKMAN back in the 90&#39;s!! or late 80&#39;s lol 

Liam Neeson is the man. Period.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLooks great.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@sphincter008 lol, good one.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaTHE TEA IS READY!!!!!!!!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaWith 2 stunning hot blondes; January Jones and Diane Kruger I&#39;m definitely lining up to see this one.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaIt seems like anytime Liam Neeson travels, people are out to hassle him.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLord Voldermort!!! xd
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitalooks good
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaTrailers are way too revealing.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me Bourne trilogy or Furgitive with Harisson Ford...
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaYes, I enjoyed him in Taken.  I can&#39;t wait to see this movie.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitawhen is this movie coming out ?

vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita*stands and claps* I would expect nothing less of Liam Neeson. Day one people! 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitasong at 1:28?
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam liam liam -- he didn&#39;t forget everything.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m guessing he has a very particular set of skills?  Ones that were gained over a very long career maybe?  Hmm?
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaGO ASLAN!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita......good luck.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson is Boss
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThese  stupid trailers.. whats the whole point giving away the story in the trailer.. A trailer should be a trailer.. especially when it looks like Taken.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaI am confused:

Liam Neeson	 ...	
Dr. Martin Harris

Aidan Quinn	 ...	
Martin B.

WHAT?!?!?!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason I was waiting for Marco from Tropoja.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaWow, a thriller that actually looks good. Rare thing these days. The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, made a very good film called Orphan last year.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshita@roscosity LMAO best comment of the week. 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaOh yeeeah, Aiden Quinn and Liam Neeson :D
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitarambo would pee in his pyjama if he encountered Liam
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitauuuu... se ve buenisima!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThis is like the movie Taken but this time he is getting is identity back. 
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaRather this than After Life. What was he thinking?
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaDr. Martin Harris... with a PhD in kicking ASS
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaHe didnt forget how to kick ASSS
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaThis Is Wiked!!!! So Gonna Watch It;)
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson... is so bad ass.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaYes I fucking love the will of Liam, he&#39;s such a strong performer, and this film looks awesome. Silly but cool. May have been spoiled, by the trailer... we&#39;ll see.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLooks like hes bringing back his fighting training from Taken....YES!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitawow. looks great!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitareminds me of nowhere man with bruce greenwood...very good show in the nineties.

wanna watch this movie!!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitawhen is it going to come out?
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaIt looks pretty cool but it also looks awfully similar the TV show Nowhere Man.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam is one epic actor!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson is a Beast!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaLooks good,better than Taken.
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaliam!!!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitaBOURNE! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUURNNNNNNNEEEE! BOURNE!
vSXUgkCjdBMdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait!!!!

FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaandddd cause of this trailer, cornstarch sales has gone up :P
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaMarvel&#39;s really stretching the source material here.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaScarlett is everywhere. And I&#39;m ok with this. That being said, the trailer made me hungry and I&#39;ve just finished eating.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI actually like this movie. It&#39;s charming and cute. Plus RDJ, ScarJo, and Jon Favreu. In it. That&#39;s awesome
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if they make shawarma? Have your ever had shawarma I don&#39;t know what it is but ima try it.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaHate to say this, but did Johansson say yes to every movie offered to make as much money as she can before she has her baby? What&#39;s the point of her even being in this film?
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll never look at a can of corn starch the same ...
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitafinally a movie im excited to go see, great cast!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaJohn Favreau, RDJ, and Scarlett Johansson in a non-Marvel movie. I think what we&#39;re looking at is an alternate universe here.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaThis is pretty similar to the cast of iron man 2
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaSofia Vergara and Scarlett Johanson in the same movie. Whoa
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaYeahhh..... Being a chef is not so much like this trailer :D its stressful and well I could go on for hours¬†
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaIron Man 4 with food

FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshita... maybe put down jon favreau movie too? i mean, he is the main character...
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaThis is really a good cast i mean they even got Dustin Hoffman
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaTony Stark helping his security guard after finding a cure from death with the helped from Black Window to protect Happy from death.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaJohn Leguizamo......the guy who never ages. I swear he looks the exact same as he did 25 years ago.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitathank christ its been a very long time since i have seen a trailer for a movie i like, probably last one was wolf of wall street.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaJon Favreau called in all the favors he could in this movie. lol
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaHold up! So Monica Geller dumps Pete and then Pete goes on to become a super chef to stick it to her?!!?!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshita<b>NICE, Tony Stark reprising his role as Robert Downey Jr.¬†again!! Automatic hit.</b>
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaThat must have been great Shawarma....
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaIs his love interest Scarlett or Sofia, just wondering?
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitanow i want to put corn starch in my balls
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaHow do she has time to act in so many movies? Not that I&#39;m complaining or anything...
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaWho else is hungry now ??
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like breaking bad because of the van. Oh wait, BREAKING CHEF! Haha got you there!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI am going to try that corn starch thing .¬†
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaA movie with RDJ ,John Favro and Scarlet Johanson that won&#39;t suck. I&#39;m looking at you Iron man 2 ...........
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaUgh no Sofia Vergara, she just can&#39;t act. 
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaAvengers AU
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally Iron Man: Food Edition.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaSo that what happened ¬†to Tony Stark after Iron man 3
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m there!!!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaWow, Scarlet Johansson&#39;s been busy huh...
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaTwo of the hottest people ever in a movie ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° YES
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitathey finally know how to make shwarma.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaOK now everyone&#39;s going to try that cornstarch shit....¬†
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaTony stark all high and shit, buying food trucks like a chump. But seriously, I need to get some spicy food in me after watching this trailer.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaAnother Scarlett Johansson movie, it&#39;s like she is in many movies because she knows once she gives birth she will need a good deserved break from acting
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitalooks good
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaHalf the cast starred in Marvel Movies
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaLooks nice!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaIron Man spinoff? Lol
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaSiked!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaNow ,this is a different movie......i was so tired of watching same type of movies
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitawell now I&#39;m hungry
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaGloria, ohh Gloria...
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaCame for the Marvel jokes... wasn&#39;t disappointed.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaApparently people today thinks a great cast equals a great movie.... Every trailer on MOVIECLIPS which shows a movie with unknown actors or not as popular actors are always criticized even though they haven&#39;t seen it or done any research.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaRDJ and Scarlett!!! :D :D Yippie
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI was waiting for Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockswell to appear in this Iron Man 2 reunion. 
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaFan of food trucks. A movie about one...all the better.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaBlack Widow why u in all movie
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie about Chefs man i have waiting for something like this.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaNot a superhero movie !!!? O_O¬†<br>MAST WADSH !
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaShawarma!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI thought he was security for iron man¬†
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitawhy is scarlett in so many movies now
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaThere isn&#39;t nearly enough of Robert Downey&#39;s face in this
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitawhy are women in movies? these pieces of shit are useless they r fuckin annoying.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitabeen waiting for this since it was brought up on AMC Movie Talk¬†
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaSorry but in May imma be watching XMEN and Godzilla
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaCook+Avengers+Breaking Bad ;)
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaIron Chef+Iron Man 2.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI like the actors, but May is the month of action, two of the biggest movies of May will overshadow this film.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaHow many movies can Scarlette Jo be in at once?
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a nice friday night movie
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaI guess Happy didn&#39;t keep his security gig. Good guy Tony Stark always ready to help a bro out.
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitairon man 2 cast
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaMust watch!
FF_rYNupPwgdelimeterByIshitaSo were&#39;s Iron Man?

vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAnybody know the background song
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNzaiGzPoUg&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> dat cleavage though... O.O
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaOK so first of all the next time I&#39;m in the hotel the first thing I&#39;m going to do is draw on the back of the art... Second she&#39;s out of your league meets captain America üòè
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitagod, just help me
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaOh no.. I&#39;m going to be forced to watch this one too.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAlright captain america stop fuckin about and get back to the avengers 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaA modern-day Before Sunrise? Even the name is similar.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitathe movie is gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood ............ but the ending suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks soooooooooooo hard thx Chris Evans
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSo from what I&#39;ve gathered: Girl loses purse, meets unrealistically perfect guy with a broken past, they live happily ever after. So original.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaChris Evans you&#39;re the best actor  I love you so much and I can&#39;t wait to see it üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAt first I thought this was another crappy romantic flick but the trailer is really good. Colour me curious.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaLmao! Captain America...<br>Go get some Bro!!!...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaMy boy captain america getting some puh...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaThat looks like a sweet movie.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaWas she in that Rixton music video (hotel room celling) or?
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitathey pretty much told the entire movie in the trailer.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSHES WITH HYDRA!!!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaGreat film I especially loved the ending. Chris Evans is going to be a great director 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitathe hype is real
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSo... Cap left SHIELD to be a homeless trumpetist?
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIs it me or did Captain America make Chris Evans a one hell of a dynamic actor now?<br>This looks good and Alice Eve is a HELL of a actress, wonder why she isn&#39;t in many films?...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Before Sunrise.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaThe National!!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI just finished watching this movie 10 minutes ago üòã
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like a remake of &#39;Before Sunrise.&#39;<br>
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCapt America isnt a virgin anymore! Wohooooo hahahah
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitacleavage
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaNot really my type of film, but I might just go to the cinema to watch it to support Chris Evans. From the trailer alone, the directing looks beautiful
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaFinally!¬† A movie where the stalker wins.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know street musicians look like Chris Evans in the real world
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaMan Chris Evans can act though
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaMost touching movie! üòÄüòÄ
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit!! This look awesome!!! Can&#39;t wait...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaThis is just a mainstream Before Sunrise. They have the phone call scene and everything. Good to see they are trying to have an original thought.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaThis is actually the end of phase 2
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaYay another unrealistic romance movie! Super model guy meets super model women fall in love in 1 night, yayyyyy
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaflame on..
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaReplace Chris Evans with Jackie Earl Haley in a trench coat with a bald head and a hobo beard and this movie would probably turn into some sort of psychological horror thriller. 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Make me a hero&quot; c&#39;mon lol 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIs that kristen from statistics black window was telling cap about?
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCaptain American and Emma Frost nice film!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaBefore We Go to civil war.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCute film. They&#39;re a dime a dozen but a guilty pleasure :)
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this! :)
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Before Sunrise lol. Probably will see this just for that reason.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSooooo what song is playing in this trailer? 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaMost guys would get maced and kicked in the nuts. 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAll the quotes were cliche...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a &quot;Once&quot; clone. But that&#39;s okay &#39;cause the movie was awesome.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaWell Chris Evans is hot as hell in this.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAlice Eve is a phenomenal actress
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitahow to show the entire movie in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNzaiGzPoUg&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a> gg
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI guess Cap moved on from Black Widow
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaOh a romantic comedy that isn&#39;t vulgar or idiotic ! Thanks Hollywood!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaThe National are ones of the best salesmen out there!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaGotta go....The hOOkers r here.......

vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaHahaha Ben affleck does better movies than him, DC wins. 
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaChris Evans my man crush<br>Alice Eve my crush<br>My erection can only handle so much
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCapt finds out she was Tony&#39;s mistress. Civil War.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI see a train station, this could be a prequel to Snowpiercer...
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaso fake
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI find this very unrealistic and clich√©. A romance story that took place in a day is familiar. I remember seeing One Day which I guess has this scenario but totally different.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshita
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaBaja casi no me gusto que chafa estar√° aburrida
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitafeels like i already watch this movie at 2014¬†or maybe i&#39;m wrong
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaTurkiyee
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaOh shit, Chris Evans actually is the director of this movie... Didn&#39;t know he was into directing. Good for him. Hope the movie does well.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaFirst
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaSo it seems the Human Torch has seperated from the Fantastic 4.Either that or Lucas Lee quit acting.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaUgh all these romance movies today are soooo cliched and predictable.

vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIs this the actress from the film ATM?? Does anybody know her name?
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshita
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaI shouldn&#39;t watch movies like this, becouse later I have to big expectations for my love life :-D <br>But I&#39;m gonna see it anyway :p
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaWake me up! before we go go! Don&#39;t leave me hanging on like a yo-yo!

Starting as convenient acquaintances, the two soon grow into each other‚Äôs most trusted confidants when a night of unexpected adventure forces them to confront their fears and take control of their lives.&quot;- Oh its so romantic!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAlice Eve. Omg
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaFor his Directorial Debut...i&#39;m impressed by this trailer! Will definitely watch this!
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaCaptain America gets all the hoes bro.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaWell what do you know, a Before Sunrise/ Before Sunset/ Before Midnight ripoff.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s very difficult for a movie like this to work.... and honestly it doesn&#39;t seem it is.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaAll those stupid Cap America and Avengers related comments.
vNzaiGzPoUgdelimeterByIshitaMr. Rogers better be careful because she might work for Hydra.

3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita^^
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaOnly on YouTube do I need to watch an ad to allow me the ability to watch an ad.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s the actor at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a>? I&#39;ve seen him in a few things here and there but can&#39;t remember his name. I&#39;m not talking about Ben Kingsley, I&#39;m talking about the guy who looks a bit like James Marsden.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaAventador Roadster? Okay, okay i can deal with that :D
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaI see no point in seeing the film since the entire plot has been surmised for me by this trailer.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> Captain, who is she? :)
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis is like The Host in some way, just without the aliens, etc.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaSong?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaannnnnd... THIS will <i>bomb.</i>
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaJesus saves some plot twists for the movie why don&#39;t you?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWhy would you restart your life in the body of a 38 year-old? I know it&#39;s Ryan Reynolds, but still, I&#39;d go for someone a bit younger.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLife is a gift, people need to just enjoy what they have instead of messing around with what they think they need
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalooks pretty cool.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaTHAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitawith a trailer like that who needs to see the movie?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalooks really good!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWow...Ryan Reynolds is starting to star in some really interesting movies...
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaHopefully this never becomes possible in the future.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaI like it.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitahmmm seems like they just ruined the whole film...
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalooks really interesting¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis looks dope.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitathis movie is F*ck!ng Murder¬†<br>can&#39;t wait for this one
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaOMG copy Avatar movie in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=1m50s">1:50</a> copy godzilla soundtrack trailer¬† what wrong this movie
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitagenius.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaYAY GUY FROM INTIMIDATION GAME!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis really looks good.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis kinda reminds me of Face-Off, but I can be wrong
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalooks good!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita<br><br>
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalooks promising¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaHm, this looks interesting. Big Ryan Reynolds fan. This would make an excellent date movie...
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWow, this looks brilliant¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWhy does this feel oddly familiar? For some reason this seems like a old wine in a new bottle with a fancy new cork.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitagenius!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitai have to see this movie
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good, just wish they didn&#39;t give away the entire movie
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWow, this actually looks great!¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThey literally spoiled the whole movie in minutes! SMH
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThe Lazarus Effect 2 + Transcendence 2: Eletric Boogaloo
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t a fresh concept. More like a different angle of the movie Freejack in the early 90s.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaDang.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita.....Interesting.¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis is my kind of movie. 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThe fact that Tarsem Singh is directing tells me that it&#39;s already going to be a flop. That guy have something like ant-movie making disease.¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaNice new concept
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaok ill buy this¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaMan I am so pumped that there have been so many new sci fi movies coming out with decent plots!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaAh classic transformers 4 trailer music. 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks promising but typical. Don&#39;t fail us ryan!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaA fucked up Avatar...on Earth! Orsum (!!!)...tho that sed (trailer making Ppel!) don&#39;t use the blown-away-by-the-wind lettering of Transcendence coz it&#39;s a bad omen, that movie was pritE bad!¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaBefore he gained invulnerability as the Deadpool, he reached immortality as The Mandarin.<br><br>X-Men Origins: Deadpool
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaAn amazing plot but the trailer is just destroying this for me none the less I am gonna give it a try¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaSONG PLEASE?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaReminds me of The 6th Day 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitathis story is very interesting!!! finally something different!! instead of a reboot or a sequel! will be very interesting to watch! can&#39;t wait! :)
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.  Reminds me of movies like minority report... vanilla sky and face off... well have 2 wait and see. 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaSweet looks actually promising :) i love Sci Fi Thrillers <br><br>Usually in today&#39;s standards Sci Fi hasn&#39;t been much of a factor or people try to over complicate it<br><br>Great Modern Sci Fi films that are great are Predestination, Edge of Tomarrow, Looper and ect<br><br>Just don&#39;t do an After Earth or Jupiter Ascending.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitagijobaa
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita~slow turn~ &quot;aaand you&#39;ll neverrrr see meeee coming&quot;
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitawow thank u for showing most of the movie in this one trailer.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks good but I have to say that this looks very different for Tarsem Singh film. 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaInteresting. Will check it when it comes out!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaNothing new, a new spin on Freejack. 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaWhy does every movie has that stupid Inception sound?? What a lack of originality
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaSeems like a new concept.. Hoping this movie to be awesome..
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaif they just left the fact that they killed ryan character so the guy from iron man can get imotality it would had a better twist but oh well i&#39;m still watching it¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaRyan Reynolds, YES!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaIt reminds me of the island a little bit... although in that movie they were clones. But close. I&#39;m intrigued, I can say that I am gonna watch it, but not in theaters
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaDollhouse?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalike the look of this
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks bad ass!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaHeinlein rip off- I will fear no evil, at least make it a transfer into a hot chick.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaEvery single motherfucking trailer gives all the plot twists these days.... Only teasers are worth it (or maybe just not watching the second half of every trailer to spare yourself from spoilers).
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaHurry up with this shit and give me my deadpool movie ryan reynolds! Nice twitter teaser btw
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitalove it
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaIf I can choose a mortal life or immortality, I will take immortality.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita...Yea!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=00m58s">00:58</a> - them nails be outta control!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaOzymandias, Manderin and Deadpool... They have the best evil plan ever!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks good this does
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitai get the feeling that they give away a little too much but still looks pretty good seems like a rian johnson movie honestly
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agaVwt0tb8&amp;t=1m15s">1:15</a> what song is playing?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThe dream of the ultra rich.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThat scene where Ben Kingsley is looking out the window reminds me of the character he played in Lucky Number Slevin - Shlomo (aka: the Rabbi).
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitawell thx for giving away most of the major plot details.¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks like Face Off but with dead pool 
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks good! Glad I won&#39;t have to pay to see it tho cause the trailer just told me everything.
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good, but would look equally good with way less info/shorter trailer
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaSo Ryan Reynolds&#39; character was killed so that Ben Kingsleys could live on, and the woman he meets was his wife?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaManderin and Deadpool in the same movie, yay!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitashowed too much in the trailer.....
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis could be the sequel to 2010&#39;s Never Let Me Go.¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaOMG! I need to watch this movie!!
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome¬†
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitadid they use prometheus trailer score ?
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks cool
3agaVwt0tb8delimeterByIshitaLooks like it could be pretty good. Finally a movie that&#39;s not a reboot. A fresh concept.

vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita@BvilleFilmFest had a chance to see an early screening of this movie and it&#39;s going to make you laugh so hard!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitamost annoying duo ever
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita&quot;My safe word is keep going&quot;<br>That&#39;s 2 words. Stupid John Cena 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaComing out the same day as Star Wars... Not a good plan.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitajust like john cena, i can&#39;t see this, this looks just wrong and not funny
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI find these two women the most sexy women in the world
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI wish theyre not releasing it on the 18th! That&#39;s the day I am going to enjoy Star Wars Episode 7 pleeeasee<br><br>Also that music needs to go, it&#39;s horrible!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSeeing this before I see Star Wars. I love Amy Poler and Tuna Fey...... We&#39;ll need I say more
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaTina Fey is very special. Don&#39;t know about this movie though.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one disappointed since this doesn&#39;t look that funny....
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaJohn cena is trying to be like the rock, but if comedy
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaDont Call it a belt. Its A Title ! YOU&#39;REE FIREEDD<br><br>-Vince McMahon
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRnhEjP3R-c&amp;t=1m45s">1:45</a> omg what was her name!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaCan someone tell me who that is at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRnhEjP3R-c&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a>? Please :)
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI guess I don&#39;t have humor.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaMARK WAHLBERG is that you? :D
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLooks corny and predictable. I have seen this shit like movie many times before. Very sad how hollywood keeps recycling the same script. 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitano
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious. But that last scene...does anyone really think that&#39;s how buttholes work? During the entire process, not one writer or actor or even that guy in post was like, &quot;No, if he fell on that and it went in, he&#39;d need a hospital&quot;?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaWas I the only one that after watching this had to immediately re-watch it? This is AWESOME!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSophia June¬† WE NEED TO SEE THIS NOW!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaBroad City: The Movie...
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitajust another movie nobody cares about, id still do them though
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the name of the main song of the trailer?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaIdk why people keep mentioning Star Wars. You realize you are allowed to watch more than one movie if your little heart desires,right?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSOOOOOOO ready for this!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23amypoehler">#amypoehler</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tinafey">#tinafey</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sistersmovie">#sistersmovie</a>

vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaWhat can I say?! I&#39;ve been waiting for Tina&amp;Amy reunion and I can&#39;t wait!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaConseguiram juntar as coisas q mais amo em um √∫nico v√≠deo<br>Tina Fey+Amy Poehler+David Guetta= perfei√ß√£o <br>
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitai saw this for the first time 20 minutes ago and i&#39;m still laighing
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI wish I would come down with a severe case of Tina Fey all over my face.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaYes to this. ¬†:-)
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaAmy Poehler&#39;s face!¬† The one that survived a nuclear blast!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaDepeche mode yeah üòáüòé
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaOMG YES TO EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaIM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSorry Star Wars ima watch this instead :)
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s going against Star Wars. Let&#39;s put this under &quot;make out&quot; movie.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita What&#39;s the name of the song please ?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI just came here to see john cena
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaA movie with Amy and Tina how does this not have more views? 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita&quot;Congrats on your wrestling championship!&quot; LOL
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE that their playing roles that are totally unexpected. Especially Tina I&#39;ve never seen her like this! It&#39;s like they switched roles from &quot;Baby Mama!&quot; They have my money instead of Star Wars!!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks PERFECT.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLooks weak as fuck. the best laughs come from the guys.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI see John Cena is getting huge push in Hollywood.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI think what really needs to be pointed out here is goddamn Tina Fey only gets hotter.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaMy god this looks dumb. And I say this as someone who likes Tina &amp; Amy.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see !!!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaCongratulations on your wrestling championship lol 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious! I love them.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care if Tina and Amy don&#39;t look like sisters at ALL, this looks really promising.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaRIP to this shitty movie. Star Wars will blow it the fuck away.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSame old women&#39;s comedy crap and is john cena gonna be in every chick comedy why 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaFrom the director of Pitch Perfect...<br>¬† ¬†and a producer of Meet The Parents...<br>¬† ¬† ¬† and a caterer near the set of The 40-Year-Old Virgin...<br>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†comes a movie we&#39;re unsure how to sell to you.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaTheir roles in baby mama are like reversed in this movie lol 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSo its basically project x but with SNL comedians... that is AWESOME! 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaüòç
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLOVE THIS and will for sure be taking my sister though I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll sit with &quot;her&quot; friends! ¬†XO!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaAll the Star Wars comparisons make me roll my eyes so hard. This film will do just fine and make a lot of money. The budget for this was probably 7 or 8 times less than Star Wars (even more if you factor in marketing), so it can happily make 7 or 8 times less profit on opening weekend.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita&quot;I been thinking...&quot;<br>&quot;Why?&quot;<br>HAHAHA
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaCongrats on your wrestling championship
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLold a bit
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaHilarious üòà
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaJohn cena might finally start winding his career down now that he&#39;s getting all these movie roles
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLiz Lemon and Leslie Knope go on a rampage!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaIs anyone gonna talk about how American Ultra first used the same song on their trailer?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaWelcome to the new era of women acting trashy as &quot;entertainment&quot; (see also Schumer, McCarthy, these two...).¬† This wouldn&#39;t even be funny as an SNL skit.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaComing out the day before my birthday, so happy.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaJohn Cena with face tattoos. hahaha
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but I feel like I watched the whole movie by watching the trailer 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLiz Lemon &amp; Leslie Knope (Lester Knopf)...
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie is aimed at older women that don&#39;t like Star Wars... 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaNice diversity there, you have a white blonde and a brunette starring! Plus the trailer told the entire shitty movie. Yawn.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaThis movie releases on the same day as Star Wars.....<br><br>May the force be with them LOL.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaSorry,but Star Wars will crush the Sisters
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaJust dropped a 120 IQ points in under 3 minutes.
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitai swear hey mama just ruined the trailer !
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaOMG I can&#39;t wait!!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshita 
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitathis looks gross... im still gonna watch it and probably enjoy it though

vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaMY BODY IS READY
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaanyone notice that this movie is basically a hybrid of Project X and A Good Old Fashioned Orgy?
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaLeslie Knope!
vRnhEjP3R-cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna go to this movie instead Star Wars 7

-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaMovie was good but I hate the ending because it was incomplete for me and I hate movies like that. For example, does the family ever end up safe and have to quit moving from places to places? What happens to the old man in prison? They know he‚Äôs the one sending people to kill the family so did they do anything to him? Did the father ever publish his writing? ETC ETC ending could‚Äôve been better.

-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaAnyone came after aravinda sametha
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitahhaha Just the trailer is insanely immoral and really hilarious when we know the real state of violence in this world  ^^
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaThis movie deserves a sequel or series b now, common Hollywood
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaI watched this recently, and it&#39;s wao.

-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!!!
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaThe 1st loud belly laughs comes with gifted (and still gorgeous, aging gracefully!) Michelle Pfeiffer scene in the market...hearing the Frenchies slam their WWII LIBERATORS, parlons en francaise, slamming Americans and their entire culture.  Only they don&#39;t know Michelle (Mrs. Mafioso DiNero)  speaks fluent French!  Peanut Butter, anyone?  LMAO!  TNT anyone?  DYNOMITE!  Love DiNero, love Michelle...Robert has done so many great classic Mafia Movies, he can afford to do the comedic Mobster.  What a great movie!  So funny, watching it for the first time right now!
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitalove the song omg
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaPeanut Butter-YOU GO GIRL!
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaYeah for making pizza.
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaDianna Agron &lt;3 *__*
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitaOr movie that should be called Why we Italians are still bad and cool as mobsters and not white people and mexicans like Heisengberg, Jesse Pinkman, Tuco and Tio Salamanca... No seriously we are still cool :&#39;(
-SwDU04OeakdelimeterByIshitasurprisingly... I really really wanna see this movie XD
hzxhbxXmbq4delimeterByIshitaSuch a funny and cute movie!
hzxhbxXmbq4delimeterByIshitaim surprised Seth Rogen did this after Superbad
hzxhbxXmbq4delimeterByIshitaSolid trailer for a supremely underrated film! Askewniverse for life! Though this isn&#39;t canon. Lol.
hzxhbxXmbq4delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe this came out 10 yeas ago.
hzxhbxXmbq4delimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen is a goat

GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaHe is ignorant you can tell by the way he replies.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaYou no children are watching your remarks, lessens are remembered, I hope your children don&#39;t take to you like this. Or maybe that&#39;s where you learned it...
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaRefresh my memory, which movie does he play Wilson in again?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaYou should be blocked for low intelligence. This is for mature language not stupid remarks.

GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaVulgar language is not mature, so why not clean it up?  Who ever Pakku1 is...
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaA helicopter assault ship, guided missile destroyer, a frigate, FBI hostage negotiators, and a Navy SEAL team were involved in the incident this movie is based on. 

Look up Maersk Alabama Hijacking on Wikipedia.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t this just a very action version of A Highjacking?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitayou&#39;re ignorant
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitawow so not all pirates have a beard and a wooden leg??
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaUm &quot;Based on a true story?&quot; I&#39;m going to go with Somalian pirates, who have, yanno, been in the news a whole lot in the past few years. 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaMany Somalian pirates, are however, black.  As they are from Somalia.

GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitawow why the fuck are the pirates black? racism at its fucking finest...historical stats show that most pirates were actually white
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaspoiler: SEAL snipers kill the pirates at the end!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitadoes he shoot a tank with a pistol as it gets destroyed by an airstrike?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaTom Hanks in a boring movie.... YOU DON&quot;T SAY
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry, were you expecting Michael Bay-like explosions right from the start?

For fuck&#39;s sake, it&#39;s good to see a movie slightly different from the classic Hollywood formula, although some similar ones have already been produced..
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitanow bolt is moonlighting in movies as a pirate... they really should pay track athletes more...
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaYou see he couldn&#39;t because they had guns.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWhat was his comment, its deleted 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitabecause they would have been shot at very close range
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThat has to be the worse name ever. Period. Ever.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWhy didn&#39;t they just lift the latter off? Or better yet, pick them off one by one from the ladder? It was their only entry point, they could have stopped them there.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaLooks like an interesting movie, I&#39;ll definitely watch it.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaI love a good true story, Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass are great and I&#39;m sure Richard Phillips is a hero who deserves to have his story told, but honestly, all I could think of is &quot;this would have been awesome Die Hard sequel.&quot;
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitajust kill the main pirate then you&#39;re pirate king, duh and or, hello
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a good thing that you don&#39;t read or watch the news.  Or else you would know the whole story.  
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThis film looks like ass.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWWWIIILLLLSSSOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaI have to agree this time. It&#39;s quite ridiculous. Although it&#39;s probably an entertaining action movie, I also think that this story has been told so many times that I&#39;d rather not spend time or money just to see a Tom Hanks version of it.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaok this looks like something I might actually pay to see. First time in 5 years, good job Hollywood.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshita:D
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitayeh how did you know omg
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshita:)
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitahahaha 14 yrs old kid.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitahahaha this is a film ? :D
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitafood and medicine for everyone.  o wait never mind its based on where you were born and the color of your skin :( :( : (  
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaPaul Greengrass! Awesome, he went to my school! Gravesend Grammar School! Great to see he&#39;s working with stars like Tom Hanks!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitayawn
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaTim Honks?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitathe video randomly paused at 2:01 making this trailer that much more dramatic
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaLE REDDIT ARMY IS HERE
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaPirates of the Carribean 6?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaSteven Seagal is back baby! Underseige 3!  wut wut
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWilson is back, back for blood.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitahaha dont have your period
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaChills went down my spine....Fucking chills I tell you!!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitashut up
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitayesssss. Tom Hanks can do no wrong. 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaYou understand that this HAPPENED, right?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThe ignorance. It hurts.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re joking right? You don&#39;t get out much do you...

Please stay off the internet.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaInternational Piracy is in fact responded to with military forces. I dont know about the aircraft carrier, probably stationed somwhere on the atlantic ( or whichever ocean it is) and they COULD respond to such threats. Its not unheard of.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThe ONLY reason I want to see this is because of Tom. Otherwise it looks boring.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWHEN???
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWait.. one relatively small cargo ship gets an aircraft carrier, other naval forces and paratroopers to help it deal with some pirates... this doesn&#39;t happen LOL
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThey&#39;re from Somalia so they should be.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaof course they&#39;re black smh..
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaOnly a thousand views?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaI know how this one ends.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaTypical Somali Pirates......this is the reason why most cargo ships hire armed mercenaries these days........
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re complaining about? 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaWay to summarize the entire fucking movie.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaSomalian...
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaactually it&#39;s probably a stock sound file, used both in call of duty and this film by coincidence.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitait ends with Captain Richard Phillips being taken into a semi-rigid lifeboat with the pirates and fleeing for anther, larger pirate ship. Negotiations between the USN and pirates continue until the captain&#39;s life is placed in imminent danger, at which point three seal snipers who had parachuted onto the USS Halyburton 2 days prior kill the pirates.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaexcept that the hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama isn&#39;t fictional.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshita&quot;My name is Voit dumbass&quot;- Family guy.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitapoverty drives people to extremes of desperation.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshita &quot;I share the country&#39;s admiration for the bravery of Captain Phillips and his selfless concern for his crew. His courage is a model for all Americans.&quot; - Barack Obama
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitacaptain black ethiopean
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaForrest is that you?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t they get it?? That trailers like these give away way too much of the movie that I care to know. Why should I even bother paying for this shit?? 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaSo apparently this Captain they are making a WHOLE film about, was pretty much a coward, good job!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaDid they just not eat for 2 weeks or are these guys real Somali pirates? It&#39;s pretty scary how authentic they look.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitalol exactly the same as &#39;Kapringen&#39;  ... look it up!
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaPutting this on my list
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaHe should stick to stealing the declaration of independence
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitamw2 soundtrack. 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaafrica needs a good nukin
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaCaptain Black Sparrow
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitatake my money right now
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThey just shows the main bad guy getting killed at 2:10 I&#39;m sure of it.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThis does look like a good movie. 
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshita&quot;they&#39;re not here to fish&quot; ahaha
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThey should make a law stating pirates can&#39;t own guns. Maybe expanded background checks for pirates. I&#39;m sure that would totally solve the problem, right guys!? Right?
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThe trailer uses music from call of duty

GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaPls come back in the next part of Bourne series, director Paul :&quot;
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitawow great movie its going to be epic.
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaThey should call Luffy
GEyM01dAxp8delimeterByIshitaNow I want a new Pirates of Carribbean movie

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaSo... it&#39;s basically &quot;Phone Booth&quot; but on a ledge??

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@Impulset0 did you watch the trailer? its clearly not just 120 minutes of a man on a ledge

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s Sam Worthington&#39;s character&#39;s name again?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita1:58 man in black :O
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaNice to spoil the whole plot in just the trailer, saved me a theater-ticket for something else.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t Van Halen playing in the back ground?

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaJamie Bell!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaeste music -fantastico !


sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitais it just me r does this trailer seem like it just gave da whooole movie away????
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@CheekyChugs true. i love bad guys as well. but that one movie he&#39;s gonna be in (Retreat) he&#39;s such a creeper type of bad guy!! I can&#39;t handle thrillers anyway, but I&#39;m gonna watch it anyway. I LOVE GARY OLDMAN! He&#39;s tied with Jamie as my favorite actor! I haven&#39;t seen a lot of his movies yet, but I&#39;m working on that. I haven&#39;t seen Leon yet. What&#39;s it bout? and i have no idea bout the tickets. I need to figure it out myself
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaElizabeth Banks.... WTF happened to you? Did your agent go on a 2-year-long vacation? You were the &#39;IT GIRL&#39; for a hot minute, Now you&#39;re nothing. You can tell she&#39;s gonna be terrible in this just from the few lines she has in this trailer. SHE SHOULDA GOT NAKED WHEN EVERYONE WANTED HER TO!!!!!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@MTGFugim Bloody laptop. Deleted my comment by accident. Back on topic. He&#39;s an escaped convict. They have a duty to bring him to justice, not to let him kill himself. And I don&#39;t think they&#39;d shoot, they&#39;d just be providing overwatch in case he does something stupid.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaOh! Alex Mason (Sam Worthington) and Jason Hudson(Ed Harris) are in a suspenseful adventure again. First Vietnam, Russia and now New York!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@CheekyChugs IKR?! I mean I hope he&#39;s not the bad guy in the sense that the viewers are supposed to dislike him. I don&#39;t mind if he&#39;s a thief that the viewers are supposed to love. That only makes him ten times cooler in my mind &lt;3 still, i hope Nick&#39;s innocent in the end
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaKinda reminds me of phonebooth..
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaaw, I love Jamie Bell! Hopefully he&#39;s a good guy and doesn&#39;t back stab Nick...
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaAnyone think the chances are high for Sam and I stranding on a desert island...?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhen i saw the trailer at first i definetly had the picture of Phonebooth in my mind but as i saw the trailer it was completely different from phoneboth whereas i hope he can deliver like Colin farell in phoneboth
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaMusic: Sonic Symphony - Infinite Expansion
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaPolice: IF YOU JUMP WE WILL SHOOT!
Man: Alright.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaoriginal_title
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaFUCKING AVATARIAN
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaIt does look like phone booth and it looks like a complete yawn fest, I think I&#39;ll be saving my $10. Thanks Hollywood for releasing more crappy films. 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitao.o they are really making movie titles more obvious
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhy do all new trailers have to spoil you the entire movie -.-
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@morenitaax3 Dunno if it will be better but it looks better than many other movies coming out.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI thought Mrs.Donaghy was in North Korea? :-/
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaSam Worthington...man with nothing to loose and everything to gain
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaBLOO KITTEH
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitai heard its comin on 2012 :S
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t get these fucking numbers out of my head!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitalooks good...
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita2:11
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@morenitaax3 phone booth but worse
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a poor man&#39;s The Negotiator to me :/ ...
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI thought this would suck balls....boy was i wrong
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI half expected Optimus Prime to come to the rescue by them SFX...
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaHmm...This looks good. 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhat accent is Worthington trying to pull off??
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI thought this would be another suicide movie. Boy was I fucking wrong.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita2:11 okay bikini in a vault never seen that before, so gonna watch this now
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great! Between this and The Debt it looks like SW is giving himself a new image as an actor.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitafucking like so much....
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI got 20 seconds through, and had a horrible feeling there will be spoilers in this. I&#39;d watch this. 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaTits! Action! guns! Boobs! Explosions! ass! MORE TITS! damn I&#39;m tired of these movies  
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaThe title says it all so if the film is as shit as the title then we&#39;re in for a (shit) treat plus I doubt this will be anywhere close to how good Phone Booth was
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the dumbest movie ever!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita‚óï‚Äø‚óï BELLISSIMO !
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita2:12  I can&#39;t *wait* for the perfectly reasonable and not-at-all exploitative reason why that character seems to be stripping down to her bra and panties in the middle of a heist.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWait, how does it end?  Trailers are supposed to tell us the WHOLE STORY DAMMIT!!!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaSam has a very angular face, anyone noticed that?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;, &quot;Man on a Ledge&quot;, what&#39;s next, &quot;Dumbass Makes Obvious Joke on Youtube&quot;, oh wait, there&#39;s pages of that already. Build a bridge, people.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaComing this Fall!!!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaLooks dumb.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitabitchin

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaPlay this at the same time as Zack Hemsey&#39;s Mind Heist. EPIC
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@morenitaax3 what? how does it look anything like phonebooth?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@morenitaax3   That&#39;s exactly what i tought....
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@Teh1337H4x0rz111 LOL brilliant. You made my day.

How about &#39;Man on the Can&#39;?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure what ethnicity his character is supposed to be. His Australian accent becomes more evident towards the end of the trailer. 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita2:12 why is she in her undies when they&#39;re trying to steal a huuuuge diamond. i know chicks in undies make money but dayyyum i wanna know how that fits in
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita&quot;snakes on a plane&quot;, &quot;man on a ledge&quot;... what&#39;s next?  &quot;dude on a couch&quot;?
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitajamie belll ... I&#39;ll watch it for him.. thumbs up if u&#39;ll do too...!!!
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaSounds like that repetitive &quot;bbbbbrrrrrrrrrr&quot; from Inception...! lol.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitalooks kinda like phoone boothe
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWhy do all the the cops and criminals look like supermodels with GREAT hair?  Good looking people have cushier things to do.  
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaCombine phone booth and mission impossible+ terrible actors and directors = man on a ledge. 

Any movie that has eye candy females to make up for its terrible plot and directing, you know the movie will be boring piece of sh**. 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I&#39;ll watch this is to figure out why there is this scene 2:11
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaAh, might as well jump. Jump!
Might as well jump
Go ahead an&#39; jump. Jump!
Go ahead and jump 
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitavan damme haircut gone wrong
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@tcxmasta Yeah. That is Mason.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitalooks dope but I hate Elizabeth Banks, she is horrible. Ed Harris will kill it tho
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting. it&#39;s like Phone Booth and Inside Man collided. LOL
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita1:42 - they&#39;re hacking the Gibson!

sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@savagegalt Don&#39;t forget about the assholes who can&#39;t keep their mouths shut. Going to the theatre is just unpleasant.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaeverytime i look at sam worthington i see a giant blue cat man
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshita@morenitaax3 I loved Phone Booth, but I agree. Let&#39;s see if it turns out better or not.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaWow ... it actually looks really good! It could be done in a way that would just be a total flop, but it could also REALLY work to make an amazing film ... I hope it&#39;s the latter ;)
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitahey its the guy that did the voice of Mason from Black ops.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a great movie! I wanna see it :)
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitainteresting premise however, i don&#39;t think this is something that i would spend twenty dollars at a movie theater to see. I think this one would be best viewed at home once it comes out on DVD.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitahmm it actually doesnt look that bad
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good! ... and jamie bell&#39;s in it. I mean, come on. It&#39;s gonna be awesome.
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitacool movie
sBJSfqdhyTgdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting.

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaHollywood superstar Christian Bale

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaNac
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best realistic movie
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaSteve Zahn steals the show. He outdoes Christian Bale.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôll say this is one of my favorite movie
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaAnyone watching this in 2018?‚úåÔ∏è
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI fuck‚Äôn Love Hollywood Films. No one makes Films better then Americaüëçüëç
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaVery very good movie watch it!!!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaOne of worst movies, don&#39;t waste your time
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI just found the film that I&#39;ve been looking for 10 years, I had used &#39;&#39;What&#39;s my movie?&#39;&#39; site.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaCasi me pongo a llorar cu√°ndo le cortan la cabeza a su amigo y cu√°ndo imaginaba que a√∫n estaba con √©l üò≠üò≠üíî. La dura realidad  que suele pasar en las guerras.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaterrible cgi
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaSo stupid if I watched trailer I won&#39;t watch movie..ruins everything
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaaaaand we&#39;ve seen the whole movie, thanks trailer.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaIs He the hero? No for me, He was under obey to bomb my country. Then he was arrested by the local residents who definitely die if his fighter craft didn&#39;t crash. He kills them to escape and guess what... I  don&#39;t want to know.<br> You must have the different eye in history. Don&#39;t believe to the film.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNm9Tzo5rvI&amp;t=0m39s">0:39</a> only two soldiers have guns.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaomg bos is that you
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI found this movie out today from a book called &quot;Behind enemy lines: True stories of amazing courage&quot; when I googled Dieter Dengler
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaSad. Such an underrated movie!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitatime wasted movie, poor acting. overall 4 out of 10. better watch &quot;The Way Back&quot; I guaranteed u&#39;ll not regret.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitabu kinonu azerbaycanca tercume eleyin bizde baxaq
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaSad story for Laos we are the most bombed country in the human history by the USA. I dont see the guy in this movie a hero and sad that when he could return home didnt encourage the US stop the war. that doesnt seem he had it in his mind, nowadays Laos still suffer from the UXOs (unexploded ordnances) from the war and the people who were endangered the most are farmers and children. Recomend anyone wanna about this search&quot; Bomb harvest&quot; on you tube!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitathese comments are genius lmao
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaActing was horrendous!!!!

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaIn reality it wasn&#39;t his first mission it was his 21st Combat Mission he was shot down on.<br><br>The real guy was also German-American
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaHero Found was a great book. This was a terrible movie.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaGenialer Film!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaGreat Movie! Just saw it for the first time. I have to see it again. You don&#39;t hear Me say that often.

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaomg this is so sad
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this movie. My aunt informed me this movie is about her neighbor in California who was a POW. She said he used to take her up on flights and told her stories of this war she never believed until she saw this movie. She said he has since passed but was a great man. Can&#39;t wait. Why I never saw this I do not know.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t watch past <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNm9Tzo5rvI&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a>. Watch the film instead. A great film!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaLove this movie Bale is THE best :)
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaHorrible Trailer, way to much plot reveals.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitais this fucking movie trying to justify the war in Vietnam?
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI heard that Christian Bale&#39;s balls got bitten by red ants till they gave him the nickname &quot;Christian No Balls&quot;.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI GUESS DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE GOT CAPTURED!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a nice fucking short movie
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaVN cua toi ????????
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitadid he imagine all the other POWs in the camp?
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitagood movie 7/10
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitawant to watch the film properly? close this trailer and watch
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaYou end up moving out
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaWhy does everyone in the comments seem split on this movie?
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThe father  from batman
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis is literally the whole fucking movie. Other than the gorgeous scenery shots this movie sucked ass. 3/10
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaLol this is literally &#39;rescue dawn in 2 minutes&#39;
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaHad high hopes for this movie. Escape from south east asian prison seemed like a good set up. But the directing was just awful, the way scenes transitioned to the next was not fluid and the dialogue was just odd. Could&#39;ve been executed better, had more tension and a better script.¬†
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaIs there any relation to that documentary about german emigrant who became american pilot and was captured by vietnamese, made by Herzog some twenty years ago?
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaTrailer gave too much away

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitadid i just see the entire movie? because i feel like i did
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is horrible. One of the worst war movie that I&#39;ve seen. How it got good decent to good reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes is surprising. The movie was very poorly directed and had extremely bad pacing. Acting was sub-par. The story was way too fictional to even be base on true event.¬† For example how does Dengler escape the mob of angry villagers while his friend get chopped up while sitting right next to him. Fictional crap this like that made the movie feel less believable in a movie that is suppose to be base off something. Ending was worst.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI know it&#39;s like scary as shit to get shot down behind enemy lines. ¬†but the sun rises in the east, sets in the west. ¬†just recognize that and head south until you hit a us military base or something. ¬†can&#39;t go wrong there.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaPersonally I thought it was a good movie. I don&#39;t watch movies that often. too much to do. Haha! It gripped me up though on the back in from yard chores. :P<br>At it&#39;s finish I wept. Damn what the hell? Pussy right? Haha! My Problem is that most people don&#39;t want war but political heads in their cushy little worlds, prompt and sometimes create it for gains sometimes very much unknown to the culture from which it is started. What I am trying to say is both sides of a war are scared, think irrationally, have trouble understanding the opposition because of speech or¬† culture variant differences, therefore cannot express the identical things that they too fear or wish they had or have in common. I am now and then troubled by the fact that out of fear or the cultural differences (in essence, the ONLY thing that separates us). of course it is too bad that as HUMANS we treat each other worse than animals. this includes what Humans will do to each other within their own societies.<br>Enough Said!!<br>I need to get back to work.<br>Peace to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t seen this movie in along time it&#39;s really great and sad. Christian Bale performance is amazing!  
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitain my opinion, bad acting....except Christian, film is okay... I think 7,1/10
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaomg! Faraday from &#39;&#39;LOst&#39;&#39; ;D
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is really terrible!!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitawhen they killed his buddy ....enraged i was
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer spoils so fucking much what the fuck is this
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaAlthough this movie is entertaining, I found out that it is far from what actually happened. False facts and they made Gene look like a dick. He was a kind man who actually was the one who helped orchestrate the escape plan, preserve the rice, AND made the key. The worst part is that the director of this film didn&#39;t even talk to the survivors who escaped before or after he made this film. He made it his own hollywood production the way he wanted it.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis film is serious!! 10/10 !!!! :) watch it!!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitanice actor, very real dude
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what movie he&#39;s in he is still patrick bateman

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitai don&#39;t care what move he&#39;s in he is still a watchable actor, make movie interesting
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaWerner Herzog
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaWhy is everbody goin on about Bruce Wayne and Batman.This is nothing to do with Batman. If you ask me the Batman films are the worst films he has been in. Ive never seen this film though. I want to watch it.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaMr. Bruce Wayne HAh!!
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitamaybe you should just watch it before you judge it
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitatoo bad he&#39;s done some incredible and amazing movies then.
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaNice movie

UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaChristian bale = bruce wayne
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a very low budget movie, how the hell did they get Christian Bale???
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitahe was Jesus before Batman. look it up
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what movie he&#39;s in he is still Patrick Bateman. 
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitagreat movie
UNm9Tzo5rvIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care what movie he&#39;s in he is still Bruce Wayne.

XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaTwo year&#39;s back in 2020 someone special told me to see this movie, She said our story looks similar to these two characters of movie. I have never thought on that day we will get seperated while watching this movie together. I miss her alot now but there is no way to meet her again.   Dropping this comment in hope that some day she might come back on this trailor find this comment and everything will get sorted. ‚ù£Ô∏è
XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaNick from New Girl is such a Nick in this trailer!
XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaThat is a terrible, self-destructive plan and we&#39;re behind you a hundred percent! XD

XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaSteve Jobs was quite an over achiever during his college not gonna lie<br><br><br><br><br><br>It&#39;s just a joke<br>Sorry Steve
XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshita&quot;You can&#39;t fight me you&#39;re miniature&quot; and I took that personally!!!!
XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaExcept for Big Scot and the funeral in the beginning where she invites him on her father&#39;s funeral, she was on a party  before that and she said something stupid about it, I would never date a person like that, and at the end she is a nice and sensitive person. The movie without this things would be much better, why there must be some stupid comedy in between
XGmsRMvQ2AMdelimeterByIshitaHappy 10th Anniversary to this flick. This movie is like 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett that meets What Happens in Vegas and A Lot Like Love

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaWhy allways Liam on his movies searching for someone???   He&#39;s  kid  girl who went to Paris, and some more film$ ???<br>If anibody take me call Liam!!!!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaI was bored through the entire movie!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis was Neeson‚Äôs best performance other than schindler‚Äôs list.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIs there not a movie that he plays in that isn&#39;t a classic or a all-time hit Thriller I wonder if my fellow movie lovers know that he was in one of my favorite movies the first I&#39;ve ever saw him in was called dark man from that day forward I knew he was amazing actor Liam Neeson
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaSuch an underrated movie
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaSpectacular movie

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaArent those stairs in the trailer the ones from Joker???
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaI love Liam movies‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt watched one I disliked yet.. he is an amazing actor. I love how his roles in just about every one of his movies stays the same.. and I don‚Äôt think he should change anything..üíØüíØ
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s sad that American directors cast famous Eurpeon and other Middle Eastern actresses for sex related roles with American b-grade actors and most surprising fact is that how they accept such stupid roles with such horrible actors , I mean these women were already famous in their own country than why they do such stupid stuff only for money , money is not everything , you can&#39;t buy respect with money.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely cracking film! Neeson&#39;s best other than Taken and The Grey! üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if he was wearing a wig or did he grow it out?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaMurder of dea staff to get access to drugs dealer data makes them sinister. The victims spouse don&#39;t go to Police as they r into drugs. The killers know this...that&#39;s very chilling.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was terrifying. Monsters was an understatement.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaI have PTSD and feel unsettled every time in hear Atlantis now.

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaGripping good gangster gritty film
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaQueen&#39;s Gambit director!

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg&amp;t=0m20s">0:20</a> Looks for Familiar... Joker was Dancing right?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDan Stevens as Kenny Kristo. Perfect Role...Psychotic and Mind Blowing
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaBlack kid in the movie:  I care about what I put in my body.  No soda, no beef.<br>Also black kid in movie:  There&#39;s some Twizzlers in my bag....
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaSo when can we see Liam in a new Matt Scudder film? Matt Scudder kicks ass even when he&#39;s not shooting his gun! The dude is invincible! Liam Neeson can shrug off the bullets and keep going! Why do the Chuck Norris facts when we can use some Liam Neeson &quot;facts&quot;! That would be cool!!!!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaWatching the trailer in 2019!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis guy reminds me of Longmire. They both have a similar tragedy of losing their wives to murderers.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaJalan-Jalan Di Antara Batu Nisan ( Movie title )
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson is no joke.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLiam could be ordering a pizza and You&#39;d be shitting the fuck out of your pants...
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDan Stevens is a good actor.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis was my favorite movie in 2014
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaA very underrated thriller in my opinion
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best opening scenes in any movie.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaA good movie in its own right, but it can be really quite disturbing at times. And though Liam&#39;s performance is impressive as usual, I found the ending wholly unsatisfactory.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitawhy do they make these trailers so long it shows half the movie thank god i didnt watch the whole thing i want to be at least suprised and entertained
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLOVE this movie, really good!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitais this a trailer ?!.....they all most spoiled every thing ,,,,it&#39;s full movie not a trailer
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaoverall for me it was good movie... let said award for action actors for it could be ¬†liam neeson and denzel washington¬†<br>its classic actors for me... ¬†

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaVery very very very good movie! Liam Neeson is top notch!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie.Shame too long in places
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was complete shit. So boring. Lots of body parts. Go watch The Drop
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S NEESON SEASON
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLaurence Almalvez, watch the movie before¬†criticize.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis kinda reminds me of Taken.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaAs I read the storyline of this film on Wikipedia and watched the trailer I just realised Liam Neeson would be the perfect Max Payne!!!!

aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDone tooken 3, done starring Liam Neeson.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis nikka is always looking for somebody.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaBlack Hole Sun remake by Swann feat. Nouela
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshita.....you do realize that stories about kidnapping have existed before the movie Taken, right? Seriously, are all you people little kids? You seem to have no understanding of how time or reality work.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaHow is it he seems to be making the same movie, but it still kind of peaks my interest?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit this looks good.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaSong please?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitawho does this cover of black hole sun?? I really dig it
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaGood LUCK...<b>click</b>
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDan Stevens...trying to be much more hardcore than he really is.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great but holy crap did that trailer ruin a lot...I hope by the time I watch this that I forget these things. ¬†
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaTo hell with this shit, i think Liam Neeson can do a lot better then this lame crap again.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIs everyone ignoring that thing at the end? It looks like an alien or something.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song?¬†
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis is sweet
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThe future of hollywood can eat shit with its cgi animation n shitty storylines
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaWtf is this?Really?A fukn detective all by himself hunting down criminals?This some bs man.They need stop with the shity movies coming out.I havent seen one goo
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaUniversal Pictures, I don&#39;t need to see anything else after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg&amp;t=1m30s">1:30</a><br>bloody hell.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks ..........................brilliant.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaJust call it another &quot;Taken&quot;.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be NOTHING like Taken. It&#39;s a mystery. He will spend most of his time investigating. Very little action.¬†
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks good but the cover of &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; is a horrible pick for the soundtrack as it is a completely terrible sounding version of a great song.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Taken with a film¬†noir twist.. Minus the fem fatale.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good. I must see this!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a> Who still uses cassette tape audio recorders? ¬†It&#39;s 2014. ¬†We have mp3 players and smart phones now that can record digitally.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaAbout time there was a good movie!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaAnother Liam Neeson film this year? Damn. I remember him way back in Star Wars I, 15¬†years later, ¬†he&#39;s in tons of action movies in a year alone &amp; he&#39;s a badass. I liked that he said he done this before, its like the movie straight up mentioned Taken.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s going to be some Liam Neeson film where he&#39;s pretty much a retired 007, and comes out of retirement for one more mission. I think he&#39;d be a great James Bond.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaHoly GOD- this looks HEAVY!¬†
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaNow that&#39;s a fkin trailer... bitchin 90s grunge song Black hole sun by Soundgarden perfectly harmonized by a female singer.  With suspense thrill and creepy environment and a little psychological intimidation.  Fkin amazing!!! 
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song title???
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t it look like, at <a href="http://youtu.be/aTKBowDjMQg?t=2m17s">2:17</a>, that the dude is an extra terrestrial?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaIs 2014 the year of Liam Neeson or something?.....wait why am I complaining? THAT&#39;S AWESOME!¬†
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaWhy does no one ever source their music.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaRegarding &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, Cornell stated, &quot;It&#39;s just sort of a surreal dreamscape, a weird, play-with-the-title kind of song.&quot;[5] He also said that &quot;lyrically it&#39;s probably the closest to me just playing with words for words&#39; sake, of anything I&#39;ve written. I guess it worked for a lot of people who heard it, but I have no idea how you&#39;d begin to take that one literally.&quot; Why would they use this for their preview?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaWhy people are still trying to mess with this guy. 
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitacan someone tell me the name of this song in background.. simply loved her voice
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshita&quot;The bullet took a bad-&quot; I didn&#39;t understand the last few words, anyone know what he says?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLiam Neeson ist neben Sean Connery, Leonardo CiCaprio &amp; Al Pacino der vielschichtigste Schauspieler in Hollywood.<br><br>Er ist immer so pr√§zise und direkt, manchmal auch sehr erschreckend, aber seine Filme sind exzellent!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaI love anything Liam Neeson. Hes the best; the end.
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know who is singing this version of blackhole sun?
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaexcited for this film!!
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitaDamn this is like the 5TH Neeson film this year this dude is pimping out that money and I don&#39;t blame him =D
aTKBowDjMQgdelimeterByIshitayou might aswell call this TAKEN 2.1
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaJack jack jack ...jack  why all writer love this name
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaAnd Debt of Honor and Executive Orders.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t use Tom Clancy&#39;s name to cover your plan hate to someone. They choose Chris Pine around 2010, when Clancy was alive and highly invaited to production of the movie. 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaoh, again Clancy&#39;s shit about bad russians
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer sucks...

K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitadey revealed way too much :( 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaA chris pine movie with no lens flares?? Are you serious lol
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaSame actor,same studio, similar title card.
Where are the lens flare?
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaWell I think they did ever since you see the scene when he gives him the guns and all the explosions. 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitalooks more like a John Clark adaptation to me....oops wrong Clancy character dude
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI love you Chris Pine....yeaaaaah!!!!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaYeah more chris pine movie
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaLiterally a day after Clancy died????????????
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaNo, he is the American James Bond, minus the cool gadgets. 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaum...no. Just...no.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaCant they just call this Robert Something: Shadow recruit. It would be same. Apparently, the story is not even from the Jack Ryan series.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaCOUNT ME IN!!!!!!!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaJames Bond Wannabe
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitai like it.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitanah. this guy actually knows who he is :P
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaWhy don&#39;t I like Chris Pine?
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI hope they are not going to and by the looks of it are, going to make Jack Ryan into a action hero because he isn&#39;t, he is an analyst!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaSo is this gonna be like a Bourne thing? Never read the book btw
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaLooks good
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Mr Tom Clancy...
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer for this one! Looks good!
Keira Knightley&lt;3 Finally in something other than drama again!! 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaKeira Knightley is the Spy, Based on an Old 1932 Film. cannot remember the name, Old Style, New Film 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaRip Tom
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great. Since the next movie will probably be Without Remorse, they should do The Cardinal of the Kremlin and The Bear and the Dragon.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitayou think this is game jack :)
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaClear and present danger is one of those movies you just have on...cause its that awesome 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaRAINBOW SIX!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaAnd to think you nearly wouldn&#39;t if it weren&#39;t for that tree
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI get that reference.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitawhat did you expect Jason Bourne was trained to kill people, Jack Ryan much like all of the previous books and movies is an analyst he never willingly goes out on the field but is forced to.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI see Jack Junior a lot more than I do Senior in Chris Pine.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitayour right, i knew it looked familiar.alaska airfield escape scene 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaFirst time I&#39;ve heard Keira Knighley speak in an American accent.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitayou know for some reason I have to laugh at the director playing the villain, last time I saw him as a villain he was wearing gold
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks promising. I like Tom Clancy&#39;s movies and Chris is  going to be a great Jack Ryan. Harrison would be proud :D
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita0/10 Troll Unsuccessful 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitatom clany died :(
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitacaptain kirk is jack ryan? dafuq!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaTake my money
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita i dont give the shit to those&quot; THOR: DIRECTOR whatever, i even dont pay shit to TOKYO-HOT!  
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaPrison break hitman
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita66 thumb ups... the age at which Tom Clancy died... how ironic
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaIs this even based on one of the books? Jack Ryan is not Jason Bourne.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitai hope it don&#39;t suck, cus i love the series.. i just wish they would of went back to the open sea, like in Hunt for Red October. i love naval cat n mouse!!  
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaYawn shrug.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaFinally! What appears to be a really good movie!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaNo, you are.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Tom Clancy
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI had no idea Kiera Knightley was in this!!! What a great surprise.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI saw the title and the thumbnail and tought &quot;Bah, another generic action movie&quot;.
Then I saw Keira Knightley, now I have to watch this.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaWillem Defoe was the original Mr. Clark, gotta go with him. He could still pull it off.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI cant wait for this movie, Ive been waiting for this for A LONG TIME. To bad Tom Clancy died before it came out though, he was my favorite author.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitathanks for &#39;the girl ends up being involved&quot; twist trailer
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita1:02 stock footage from &quot;Stealth&quot; explosion scene. It obviously wont play in the movie, but that&#39;s pretty lazy when making a trailer
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitalemme guess keira knightley is a double agent?
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaLove the way the action looks
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaRIP Tom Clancy

I really, really hope they make a Rainbow Six movie (based on the book first and foremost). Its almost a guaranteed hit with the sheer number of fans of the video games included.

Costner should be Mr. Clark there too. YES PLS!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaShit just got real.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaAnother reboot?
Please honor Tom with his last project.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaAh man RIP tom clancy
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI have seen the other jack ryan movies this just makes me think of the Bourne movie&#39;s. I&#39;m still going to see it.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaOpening scene looks so fake...
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita2:06 Time for Inception
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI hope Keira Knightly is more than just a love interest.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t beat Alec Baldwin and Harrison ford.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so much better than I expected. You&#39;ll get my $10.50.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaNot a very good title (shadow recruit)
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait! 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P TOM CLANY YOUR STORIES WILL BE MISSED!!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaHoping this doesnt go full action and stays closer to the books. R.I.P. Tom Clancy

K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitacool trailer except from one thing. you showed too much of the movie, now we know that ryan&#39;s girlfriend is with the bad guy or looks like it. you showed too much
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaIn the end, Captain Kirk always comes out on top.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting for this trailer for SO LONG!  R.I.P. Tom Clancy, you were a revolutionary for your genre.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaLooks ok
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitarip tom  rest in peace 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P. Tom Clancy 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita0:03 Cant see your face because of the lens flare, Captain Kirk 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitahope this is a tribute to tom clany
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitathere are plenty of other stories out there that havent been used yet. like debt of honor which in my opinion is the best jack ryan story not put to film yet. followed by Executive Orders. just because the author is no longer with us does not mean the series stops. case in point. ian fleming and the ames bond series.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaIs jack ryan in any of tom clancys video games?
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaoh my god
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaTOM CLANCY BITCHES!!!!!! YEAH
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitajonathan kent faked his death to become a spy.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaJack Ryan is back but u can&#39;t compare it Harrison ford jack Ryan
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitawill this be the last jack ryan film since clancy is dead
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaTom Clancy&#39;s legacy! 
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaehhhhhhh
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome, can&#39;t wait.
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing!!!
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshita1:47 Tom Cruise running?
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitayou think this is game? lol
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaAnd he goes for the dip and... ladies and gentlemen his balls are in the tea cup
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitaSecond
K9KAnx4EvaEdelimeterByIshitafirst
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitalol arabian?! Isn&#39;t it Arabic dude?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaThe music sounds so arabian and non-hollywood. Not.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitafirst trailer looked cheap, but this one makes it look epic. If they make the sequel &quot;Warrior Within&quot;, it has to be as gory and violent as the game itself, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s Disney. It has to have an &quot;R&quot; rating or else it won&#39;t stay true to the storyline. Regardless, I&#39;ll give this movie a chance... ^_-
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitabad idea. there&#39;d be no way to make a main character.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s hollywood, dude! but i know what you&#39;re saying
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitawell most likely because he looks alot like the character of the Prince of Persia in the video game. And i dont know, the accents sound similar as well. it seems pretty close to the video game when it comes to the other stuff too
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitathe trailor does seem kind of boring. but i&#39;m persian and i wana watch it.
 i dont understand why they use  a british accent. i mean
isnt it called prince of persia? they should use a persian accent. and why this actor? i mean he is hot , but not for  persian movie.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaYou are aware that this is not set in the real world, and thus the characters can have any accent the creators wish? When complaining about the realism, don&#39;t bother pointing out the accents when freaking magic is involved!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaKTRose I agree ..this Brokebacky guy cant play Dastan. it must be somebody like George clooney or ..colin farell or even christian bale. not fitting for Dastan at all
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaThis just seems boring.  I don&#39;t know why.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitathey should have made god of war instead of prince of persia...but this looks good anyway....never thought jake gylenhall could pull it off...
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m 50-50 about this movie...
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitai really don&#39;t play the game but this must be a good movie.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaThe worm is the spice and the spice is the worm.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitagreat all we need now is assains creed and god of war and were set
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitai loved the game so i will love the movie
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaEPIC!!!!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitahe fits too, but its already too old for the part, the prince need to be young and inmature.

by the way, some persians were/are white and some had blue eyes. just to keep you informed
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitastarting that the prince has another name, so that makes clear that the movie is just based on the game, not a port, and who the heck want to see in movie something that is already in a videogame.

by the way, the people behind the game is backing up the movie, so is just another version of the same concept (like the new POP for xbox360/ps3/pc)
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaDark knight doesn&#39;t have gore, and it was pretty amazing
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitapulp fiction is from disney too, you know?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaPrince of per sia without sand monsters? 
nahhhhhh......
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitai think its the trilogy he has the transformation and warriior within outfit
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitawhy is he in his warrior within look
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitashe&#39;s Gemma Arterton
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie is good wait until warrior within that will be bad ass
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaLooks expensive!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitai know rigth?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaman disney is doing everything. in a way that&#39;s cool, but on some parts? not really. does ubisoft get to help out on this?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaya man it sad to it :( oso the hourglass
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaIf this is good, it would be one of only a few games turned into movies that were actually worth something at the box office and a good piece of art as well
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty good. but once i see it, all decide whether the video game or movie is better.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitait looks legit to me...
it looks really nice too..
idk about the main actor
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know wats this music called?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaEnemy At The Gates nuff said ;)
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaIt look good plus i like it cuz it has parts the first 3 games
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitasecret gaurdian temple? Someone got paied big bucks to come up with that name
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaThese are mad times we live in. MAD!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaWant to watch that! :D
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshita@buzzz623 lol
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitano camels?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitabuzzz623  hit it right on target....
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshita:OOOOOO per-per-per-perfect!!!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitame too
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitathey should have asked the guy from the mummy movies, Oded Fehr, granted he is israeli, but he is good, or done some try outs...
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a big fan of Jake Gyllenhal, but shouldn&#39;t the main character of prince of persia be cast by someone who actually looks Persian?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaThis is totally weird! Disney is coming out with a video game adaptation!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaits because it Jake Gyllenhaal. You know? The guy from Bubble Boy &amp; Broke Back Mountain?
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaits disney so it might be weird but pirates of carribean came out really good so it could go either way. btw looks like it has great graphics
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaomg cant waitt!!!!!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitalooks pretty good, They should of chosen some one else to play the key part instead.  Someone who fit the description better like Syed from lost, but it looks pretty good.  I hope Disney didn&#39;t put to much restrictions on this movie, cause it can be very good.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI told everybody that if they were ever to make a PoP movie, Disney would be involved. I was right.



Jub Jub
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshita1:54 .......... lol her face!

bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know how I feel about Jake Gyllenhaal as the prince of persia.... He doesn&#39;t even look Persian.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaMaybe.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaDisney actually makes a lot of movies that aren&#39;t for kids.

Smile! :)
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitadisney -_-
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitawell pirates of the carribean was pg13....and the first prince of persia video game was rated teen. i think disney makes wonderful movies, this one will be good =)

bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI hoep that stunt at 1:35 is still beign worked on because it looks so fake.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitalooks better than i expected
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitalooks really cool but i wish the cast were different
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait till the squeal &quot;The Prince of Iran&quot;

bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprise this is by Disney D:

bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitais this based on the game cuz i played the 1st game but i dont kno the thing in the arm looks like the 3rd or 2nd sumthin lik that,  btw the movie looks good.
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaO_O wow.  I didn&#39;t know that Disney was making this into a movie.  Still not sure but I&#39;m definately going to see it.

bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD!
bZ7Li5w2I-kdelimeterByIshitaare we going to see him in his good and evil form like on the game?
his evil form with the whip is great
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaWhat is the odd one doing here?

WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaSarcasm?

WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaMasterpiece. One of the best subtle and psychological horror movies I have seen in my whole life.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite childhood movies really
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitai think this one should be better : watch?v=__VQX2Xn7tI
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care that you don&#39;t care :o
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care ;)
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaOh please, watched this when I was eight without any freaking out.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshita...This isn&#39;t a horror movie. Although advertised as one (for profit, I can assume), it is more of a psychological thriller than just a scary movie. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitai see, interesting :L 
It was a good movie nontheless
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitait is a great movie, its wortht it. the only bad thing its that there are like 4 endings.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI for one like the ship in the movie. It reminds me of rum.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaim terrified from the trailer... lol cant wait til the dvr gets this recorded
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI just watched this movie, and it scared the shit outta me :O
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaOpinions anyone? Is it worth the time to watch? I always ending up watching those movies just like this where it involves a hotel room (always hotel) where people die but some moron still goes in and sometimes they are good and other times they suck. And is this movie predictable? 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitawatch?v=8y9buy312uE
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI absolutely love this movie.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitai thought he burned the hotel room?..
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaooooh, i can imagine a 2nd one-because of the ending with the hotel magager and the box....hhmm, very interesting film
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaeither one of you is right...im going to find out now ;L
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaIdk bout you guys.. but i was kinda disappointed he killed himself. :/
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaif this is bad then what is good? come on man. maybe not in your technical views but there&#39;s no denying that the concept of this movie was profound
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re clearly not a horror fanatic because there was no horror in this terrible movie.  Insidious was better than this piece of garbage and even that was bad.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI liked it when I saw it in theatre. Haven&#39;t seen it since. I&#39;m not sure why because it was pretty damn good.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI luv this movie
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna try to sleep right now...... Help
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaShited bricks when I saw this
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaJohn Cusack wasn&#39;t right for the role? He is PERFECT for it!
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaEveryone who says there weren&#39;t scared STFU no one cares your not gonna get a trophy watch the movie first and then you&#39;ll see
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI have a calendar and tonight was the 1408 time I have wanked in my life! I too typed out 1408 and saw this trailer :) I am about to wash my cock thenwatch the movie. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaParanormal Activity sucks
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaBased on your profile picture, I can see how.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaWatched it last night while i was high as tits
Great movie
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaDoesnt look scary but ill watch it and may enjoy it anyway.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitalol its like this movie came to me, i just was looking for movies to watch and for some reason the number 1408 came into my mind and i typed it in and this movie came up, haha :D ITS MY DESTINY TO WATCH THIS :D
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshita–°—É–∫–ø–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ü —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—à–Ω–æ
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t scared not even a minute :P
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI saw it a while ago, mildly scary but I don&#39;t really get what&#39;s going on after a while. In all the movie was a disappointment to me.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshita it might not be scary 2 u but I live in 1408 so finally something 2 scare people!!
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitathis is my movie of all times!!!! my absolute fav
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitascary at times but definitely a Psychological thriller
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitai seen that version aswel, whats the 2nd ending man?
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitamovie isnt scary AT ALL! good ideas in the movie though but it really isnt scary
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaThis Movie Isnt Even all that Scary.  Its Just Stupid And Funny To Me....
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI think why i love horror moviesis they are the thing to understanding experiences in my life of the unknown. Its a format where its acceptable to speak of such thing. Instead of the socially accepted rollling of the eyes or to afraid/resistent to believe it just because it hasnt happened you. Its very naive to believe all the millions of stories people have had with the paranormal that they were all making them up. That tells me people just dont want to believe, its to much for them. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitamovie2k.to/1408-watch-movie-1073904.html watch this movie here!!! :D 
i love this movie so much!! its awesome
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI never seen it. My Mom and her BF said it scared them...... so idk 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI am going to watch it.. I&#39; ll come back for my rating/...
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie have  two endings. 

WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaah two endings , :(
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitawrong ending ver. dude
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitabest horror movie i ever watched. I&#39;m 30 y.o. Ending - Enslin lived with his wife. There&#39;s another version where Enslin died it&#39;s shiet !
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaShould have named it room 237... would&#39;ve been better.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitahmpf, well i seen the movie twice and i still don&#39;t understand the end of the movie. you see him walk in the room like a ghost..

WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaIts a natural fact that horror movies will prepare you for the worst things in life. Such as never walk in sacred locations of hauntings, if there is a serial killer or monster attacking people never say i&#39;ll be right back, and when the lights go out never follow the slightest sounds or shadows you see or suspicious about. Life is like Scream. Learn from it!
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshita wonder what the other 55 people were thinking, or atleast the last 20 people xD
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI love this movie it scared  the first time bit after the second I laughed at it
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaNo comment.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaIt was about 11 o&#39;clock (PM) when it was played on a channel. I wasn&#39;t alone in the house but I was watching it alone.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s not the most scariest(it&#39;s a bit scary), but it&#39;s one of the best movies I watched. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI knew you were kidding me. :D
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaHOLY FUCKING SHIT I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaOK.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaTell me you&#39;re kidding.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaCool film. I watched it about 2 years ago and it was really cool. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaCool joke. :D
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely loved this film. Was really interesting and the acting was good overall a GREAT Film a must watch ! 
 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaThanks for destroying my headphones :) I didn&#39;t want them anyway...
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaWhen someone says 56 people died in one room, and warns you not to stay in that room, don&#39;t stay in that room. Horror movies will end up saving a life one day.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaWOW, exellent movie thumb up
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshita2:03 -- and that&#39;s how you get to Narnia. 
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is a brilliant work of art!
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaGreat Horror/Thriller film and John Cusack was impressive. The story was intriguing &amp; creepy. &#39;1408&#39; is one of the most unique horror films from the 2000&#39;s (next to The Descent, High Tension, Final Destination, 28 Days Later, Reeker, Cabin Fever, Infestation, Wilderness, 30 Days of Night, The Ruins, Splinter, Tamara, Burning Bright, The Fourth Kind and Triangle)
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve just watched it ...
I&#39;m a horror/psicotic movies lover ...

the imagination is still to strong of a 9 year old 
(al personal opinion)
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitaIs grass purple?
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitathe movie is way better than the trailer makes it seem. the little things they say that let you see into the mind of these characters, to almost be able to feel their pain. incredible.
WIASqPZqnhsdelimeterByIshitathis gave me chills down my spine a thriller to not be reckoned with. i really like the idea of 56 deaths and no ne ha left alive. its spine tingleing,teeth chattering,mind boggling,horrer i realy enjoyed the movie and the mysterie behind the room. actually all of my family loved it. thank you for creating this trailer and he film.

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaNo, the trilogy is written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, Paul wasn&#39;t. Also, Paul didn&#39;t reference Cornettos, The Worlds End is going to reference mint cornettos.
n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitayeah mint for alien/sci-fi. 
strawberry for zombie/gore.
plain for cop/action.

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaUK dupstep lol

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitadrink responsible.

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitathese two always makes great movies together 
n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaIt was alright at first then it got funny. The Aliens and the Fence scene remind me of Shaun of the Dead. This looks funny.

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitathis is based on a true story mate .. if you don&#39;t know shit 
n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaTHIS is how movies like The Hangover, Project X, Am Pie and 21&amp;Over SHOULD have been done. Absolutely bonkers! :D
n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitadamn spoilers!!!
n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaThats the guy that played Bilbo BagginsI love when great actors do comedies that doesn&#39;t make any sense. This is gonna be amazing.

n__1Y-N5tQkdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the Cornetto Trilogy. Basically, in each Movie, one of the Characters an Ice Cream, and it&#39;s Flavour is linked to the Film. Shaun had the Strawberry because of the Gore, Hot Fuzz had the original Blue, showing the Police Element in the Film, and this one has the Mint... You get the idea.

AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWell I know where I&#39;m going to be on August 28.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaLove the look of this film. Very, very excited...
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaOMG! This looks AWESOME! I cannot wait to see this!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitabwahahha i read the title and immediately thought this was a sequel to Jingle All The Way. This looks amazing though. SOLD!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThe girl Laurence is cute. Shes crazy looking in this. If they were to make a League of Legends real action movie, I suggest her to play Jinx the Loose Cannon. She would fit it perfectly.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitawhats the song, its awesome!!!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitawtf?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know what the tune is 21-32secs in? 
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaMad Max, Kick Ass an Fury Road all in a one!!! can&#39;t wait!!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI have watched this trailer like 20 times, I can&#39;t wait anymore
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitalooks like turbo SHIT!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI thought this would be children&#39;s movie because of the title. Boy I was wrong lol
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI want this soundtrack now!!!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThe blonde girl at the end is so cringey
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI need this theme at all costs.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaIKK
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThat girl reminds me so much of Jinx
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitait says like no other film. but this straight up troma films and like hobo with a shotgun.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI swear to christ, if they all blow up at the end though............
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaHELL YEAH!!! This is like all the make-believe games I played as a kid in the 80s brought to life in a scary, but cool realistic level. ¬†Plus a freaking awesome synthwave soundtrack from Le Matos!!!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitayou had me at Michael Ironsides.... SHUT THE FUCK UP AND TAKE MY MONIES!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaSeems like the closest thing to a good mega man movie that we will every get
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWell this looks amazing.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaGood to see Overdog McNabb back in the movies.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaMicheal Ironside? Hell yeah!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaBEST. SOUNDTRACK. EVER. 
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaSad to see the amount of gory will be of epic size, wish i could show this to my little siblings. Along with Kung Fury and some other awesome mature stuff.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWhat is that song called?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI am happy this is a thing. 
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaGreat music in the trailer. The way it kicks off into happy, electronic, upbeat energy is awesome.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI thought this was a rip on FLCL until the :33 mark.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a mix of Mad Max and Mega Man! With BMX-Bikes.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThe 80&#39;s barfed on this movie which makes it look interesting.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWhat is this awesome music playing?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song playing?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaLooks badass<br><br><br><br>
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitacount me in. ill have one cheezy Apocalypse plz ^^
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaWhat. The. Fuck.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitathat girl is nuts XD i love her
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaCommander Keen and the Wastelands of Earth
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks frickin AWESOME!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaTurbo Kid = Scott Pilgrim VS. The Toecutter<br><br>It looks fuckin&#39; cool, though.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita&quot;Like no other film in the last decade&quot; ...if you count out Mad Max Fury Road and Kung Fury. That being said, keep &#39;em coming!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaFUCKING SOLD!!!<br>GIVE IT TO ME
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI think that movie is not going to be good at all. I like the pastische of the first Kick-Ass movie and this seems to be to goofy and tryhard
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThe 80&#39;s is strong in this one.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitalol Anyone else reminded of the more Zany parts of Fallout?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaAwesome!#100
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaLooks like we&#39;re going to the movies Aug 27 or 28<br>If we miss a screening...
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaif you took kung fury and hobo with a shotgun and mix it ! this what it would look like lol
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita–ß–µ–º —Ç–æ –Ω–∞–ø–æ–º–Ω–∏–ª –∫—É–Ω–≥ —Ñ—å—é—Ä–∏ Kung Furi this
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaEnorme!!!!
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitathe girl reminded me of tiny tina from boarderlands 2 lol
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThat soundtrack sounds just like it came out of Hotline Miami, and that gore too. I&#39;m in like Flynn
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaIs it August 28th yet? Proud to be a Canadian! NSFW
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand who this is supposed to appeal to. It looks like Mad Max for tweens, but has brutal violence that would clearly warrant an R rating.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita&quot;Like No Other Film In The Last Decade&quot; -Slash Film<br><br>I guess &quot;Slash Film&quot; doesn&#39;t get out much. Any precursory look into Japanese cult films over the past few years will reveal the films of¬†Noboru Iguchi and others, &quot;Machine Girl&quot; &quot;Karate-Robo Zaborgar&quot; to name a few, films with much more originality and insaneness that what seems on display here, a cheap, American pastiche of the aforementioned cult-schlock greatness.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like ¬† kung fury
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThe beautiful love child of Fallout and Kung Fury.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaTurbo kid meets Kung Fury in &quot;Turbo Fury&quot;
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaif you liked how this movie looks, go ahead and see &quot;kung fury&quot; and &quot;it follows&quot; thena watch this one<br>. i love the music
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaYES! ¬†YES and YES! ¬†Awesomeness confirmed
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaMad Max on BMX Bikes
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaSam fisher as the villain? i&#39;ll watch it
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita80&#39;s are coming back son
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaoh my god, this movie looks beautiful.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis is like a mix between Scott Pilgrim, Kick Ass and Licenseless Rider from One Punch Man
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song? 
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the song? 
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitai know everyone is saying how great it is but it looks s little ridicules to me but the blade gun thing with the metal skill mask looks awesome  
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaIs there a dvd release date yet?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Scott pilgrim and mad max had a cereal killer baby
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaIs it the voice of Ekko? :O
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like it was made by freddiew

AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a mix between Kick Ass &amp; Scott Pilgrim.
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaLaurence Leboeuf: &quot;I don&#39;t know if I should do this movie&quot;<br><br>Shia Labeouf: &quot;JUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!&quot;
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshitaSo he&#39;s Mega Man?
AFlZ6pVtnv0delimeterByIshita:: ¬°MARAVILLOSO! ::

1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaWatch mama online at movie2k.com that&#39;s were I watch all my movies lol they have mama in clear hd.
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitawhere have you watched the movie ? pleaseee answer 
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaIf youre not familiar with Del Toro&#39;s work it may seem strange but his work is very artfull with usually a message of motherhood
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaWatched the Movie today. BEST MOVIE EVER! 
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaSo that is who Slender&#39;s wife is...i&#39;ve been wondering for a long time.
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaScared me white

1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitasame one as the first :/
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaIM DEAD

1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitait wasnt even scary. there were just scary scenes when you dont expect... but thats it.
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitathis was a fuckin creepy ass movie. it will scare the shit out of you.
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaAre you my mummy?
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaSo, you&#39;re telling me that if you look at Mama, she attacks... the opposite of a weeping angel... Hm... 
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaHave you seen the other movies from Guillermo del Toro? They have been fantastic. If you want a sensless thriller you probably dont like this movie - this is really something different.
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaWorst... Movie... Ever... Besides the hulk .. Pick one... Movie went nowhere. All jump scenes. I like the general idea of it like the premiss but holy shit this was a boring ass go nowhere movie. In my opinion of course
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaHoly!!! This movie is scary, I actually saw mama. *whispers* mama...........
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened 2 the little girl ,,, .0-0

1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaCould be really good as long as it isn&#39;t ruined by an overdependence on non-scary CGI.

1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaI remember renting pans labyrinth back when I was 12 thinking it was a kids movie.. That movie fucked me up for a while haha
1lNyP7w3CuQdelimeterByIshitaThe Devil&#39;s Back Bone was great, I like Gullermo&#39;s work. Even HELL BOY.

ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaIll give this movie s shot
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaLuther King and kitty pryde dating wow
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaEllen page hated working on this movie. Why?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaBoring and weird.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaA stupid and stereotyped movie, that&#39;s a racist level, and I&#39;m a Woody Allen fanatic; There are too many false and unreal things in the movie, too many to list, but I can name at least a couple:<br><br>1st: The fact of &quot;I have to stay chaste and pure to marriage&quot; is no longer done, there are young men and women who lose virginity at 13 or 14, go to the disco, and do not even know what the Classical music (we also have pure Bronx style neighborhoods);<br><br>2nd: We have the same fashion and clothes in America and in every other country in the civilized world;<br>¬†<br>Third: Italian-Americans are not real Italians culturally speaking, we are left to ourselves by a government that favors crime and is hiding behind goodwill (and we have not elected them!) And leaves us in the middle of the garbage;<br><br>¬† 4th: Not all are Christians, we are a multiethnic country, and there are less and less Catholic practitioners.<br><br>¬† 5th and last point we were not in the 50s !!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaAww Roberto Benigni!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI love Woody Allen&#39;s films and sense of humor. It looks really funny.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaCan a real good film director makes a movie With only abused And stupid commonplaces and stereotypes about Roma and Italy ?? I don&#39;t Know an american movie or book or Tv serie about Italy without stereotypes For idiots . Is This The american culture ?? Ugly people .....
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s strange waching this being italian... you guys have a strange opinion of Italy! We&#39;re not like that anymore, c&#39;mon
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitanon credo sia una critica all&#39;italia anzi a me √® piaciuto
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaSe vai in Grecia filmi il Partenone, mica Tsipras, no?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitai HATE woody allen
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is great but didn&#39;t understood the part of the middle class guy and the cameras following him?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitathe only garbage in this movie is Ellen Page.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitajust catching this movie now!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitahahaha love it
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaWoody Allen has a unique style for all of his movies and I like it :)

bit.ly/10tRNat?=G4o1c
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaOw believe me we have. That&#39;s why some of us don&#39;t like his movies :) You know, not liking doesn&#39;t always mean being ignorant, it&#39;s about having a different opinion :)
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaBasically the Woody Allen genre, more about the dialogue and the learning of a character!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitai love woody Allen. might see this.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitado not go and see it it is irritating 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawtf? :p
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaRoberto Benigni, Woody allen, Ellen Page, Penelope Cruz.. oh my
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaWhite People.

ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Leopoldo Pisanello!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaFUCK THIS MOVIE
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitathis  looks terrible 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaIts Woody Allen! Its just a bunch of stories! 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThats what i was thinking
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaEllen Page. nuff said.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaAfter seeing the movie, I&#39;m still not sure..

ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI really enjoyed watching that movie
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawhat in the fuck?? what is the point of this movie.........  and no @indyaakcamp even Juno had a story line -_-
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie sucked
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI like it in a weird way!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaa lot of great movies coming out this year and the next!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaAmazing movie...I loved it!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawow, it looks soooooooooooooooooooo appealing! 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshita.....woody allen :/
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaLike Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service!! 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast, including Rome!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitagonna watch this...
because Woody Allen.
plus this CAST! YES. i&#39;ve nothing else to say. = u=b
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaSeriously what the fuck was going on there?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaOh Ellen so nice to see u again! :D
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaellen page &lt;3 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great. I&#39;m moving to Rome in a week for a year so DEFINITELY going to have to watch this!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitathis movie is sosososo cute ! i love it
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaEllen Pageee :D
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawhat?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawith Ellen Page, too..&lt;3.&lt;3
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaWoody Allen&#39;s movies are so good sometimes becasue they&#39;re about REAL people and the conversations dont feel so scripted. 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitahaha looks great!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaTo watch this movie online in HD go here bit.ly\romelove
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look very good to me, but I might just see it because of Ellen Page :)
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitawhen does this come out, I want- HAVE to see it.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this movie..
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitai feel like Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page have the same personality
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaWoody Allen, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, and Alison Pill. I will see the fuck out of this movie.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaOh I hope woody tours all over europe for his films
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s funny, because for most of his career his films have been placed in America, New York especially. Now he is starting to branch out. So please, check your facts. 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaNo..just stop Woody Allen...just stop...
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Juno, Mark, and and Jack! 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitayup looks good
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitathe guy at 0:25 looks like the old mman from up
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaonly thing i dont like about woody allen&#39;s films is that it always seems to be AMERICANS going to europe and having adventures - don&#39;t see why he couldn&#39;t do more films about the Europeans themselves?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThis movie has a brilliant cast!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaJESSE EISENBERG + ELLEN PAGE = WIN!!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaomg thats the dude from life is beautiful!!! 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve always said that Ellen should be in a Woody Allen movie. She has the right sort of... quirkiness for it.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaRoberto, I love you!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaJesse Eisenberg does in fact deliver one line in this trailer. You should watch The Social Network (for which he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar) and 30 Minutes or Less. He doesnt &quot;play himself&quot; as you so aptly described it.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitai wasnt aware you could foresee an entire performance just by seeing him deliver one line.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshita:D yay!!! ellen page!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitadat cast!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitahehe, welcome to Woody Allen XD
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaAnother Woody Allen film-- say what you will about being a cliche, I love his films.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaEllen Page!!!!!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaEllen Page on the thumbnail brought me here.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!!! Its Powerpacked!!!! &amp; Woody himself! Can&#39;t wait to see.....
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaso whats the plot of the movie...?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaYa, at first I likes Jesse Eisenberg, but as time goes on, he seems very one note and annoying... However, it is Woody Allen and that&#39;ll redeem it if Eisenberg is just a small player.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshita@ThePsybapunk Well clearly you haven&#39;t seen his body of work and you&#39;re most likely politically biased toward him.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m thinking the same, but for Alec Baldwin.
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI hate Ellen Page. Wonder if Woody can make her likable?
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaroberto benigni, how have you fallen....
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitadirected and written by Woody Allen that&#39;s all, I&#39;m going to see this movie
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaI see an apple in the corner...hmmm *judgemental face*
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaPft. Lets see if it can live up to &quot;Manhattan&quot;. 
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaMeh. The only exciting people in this movie seem to be the non-English speakers (Penelope and Roberto).
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaman, penolpe cruz. so fine!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitait looks amazing, I can&#39;t wait!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaROBERTO FUCKING BENIGNI!!!!!!!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitaThe cast is awesome!
ft__aQSrHqEdelimeterByIshitafirst!
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaThe greatest warrior from Europe. Something like that.<br>More dramatic in theaters..

DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaI had to stop watching when my dad showed me as a kid because that opening scene with the party scared me so bad. Probably gonna watch and overcome some childhood trauma!
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaSuch a badly animated movie but entertaining nonetheless.
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaI LOVE BEOWULF SO MUCH

DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaLol I&#39;m gonna tell true story bare with me for a sec...in 2007 after school I stole this from blockbuster 10 years later I try to watch it again but it look different so I went to Google it cause I thought it was wrong film just to find out the whole time I was watching cgi animated instead of a real life film to this day I laugh about it
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaWhat‚Äôs the music in this trailer?
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaThat temptation theme is what works in some of Robert‚Äôs movies.
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaFrom The Director of The Polar Express  üòç
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaHasn&#39;t aged very well at all.
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshita15 years later the animation still amazes me! I remember being dumbfounded when I realized it wasn&#39;t live action. Big ups to the VFX artists
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaThis needs a new audio book, this was pounded out in mead halls by warriors, and one who happened to write wrote it down,a warriors speech was honor and praise, so few in this world know it, rewrite it aloud
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaFELIX
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaNo

DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaI watched this several years ago.  Thought the details elude me, I remember liking it well enough.  I just read the book for the first time (Stephen Mitchell translation), so I want to watch this again.  They&#39;ve obviously taken some liberties with the story, but that&#39;s to be expected.

DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaDamn I came here after seeing this on Netflix, I remember watching it YEARS ago and it took me halfway through to realize it was animated, can‚Äôt wait to watch it again!
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshita&quot;She&#39;s not my curse. Not anymore&quot;

DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshita&quot;Beowulf&quot;(2007) is an excellent and very spectacular epic fantasy adventure movie!
DLukQJO5SH8delimeterByIshitaTerrible movie completely pathetic looks animated and Grendel looks a lot more scarier than that I hope between 20 and 2025 we&#39;ll see a better beowulf movie than this crap. And Grendel had teeth there are no teeth being shown this looks like a 5-year-old made it

FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaBest movie
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaLa casa de papel
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was one of the best roles Denzel Washington played. I&#39;ve watched it more than twice, and the ending is what amazes me the most. It has an amazing plot. And the antagonist is quite smart. Would recommend a hundred per cent.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaWho is here after money heist

FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshita100% no way that woman was albanian
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaThis film has Dil se(Hindi film song) playing in the opening credits. By A.R. Rahman. So before Slumdog Millionaire happened this filmmaker &amp; team already explored Bollywood music.<br>The film is good too. But the song was such a surprise. Thank you.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaQuote from inside man:<br><br>(Dalton Russell)<br>&#39;&#39;Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink. You can cover them up for a while, but they don&#39;t go away.&#39;&#39;<br><br>A lie has short legs. You can run with a lie, but you can&#39;t hide from the truth. It will catch you. The truth doesn&#39;t cost anything, but a lie could cost you everything.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaSo good i had to watch it twice. When he bumps shoulders at the end üòì üò¨ The sequel was so disappointing tho.

FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie,  but there is something not right, they all heard his voice and when they all got out, if  I were the detective, I would have known that none of them had his voice, so I would know 100 percent he still inside, and that type of bank sure deserves a relentless non stop search lol.

FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitathat netflix tv show La Casa De Papel (or Money Heist) seems <i>awfully</i> similar to this

FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaWay better than &quot;Taking of Pelham 123&quot;.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaI think there was a desire to follow up on this film, I wonder what it would be like to give
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best heist movie after Inception.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaNiceeee
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaI haven&#39;t seen this movie. Is it worth watching?
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaWhat held this movie back was Spike Lee directing it. The cast was great. The plot was great. The directing was abysmal and Spike Lee clearly drag sucks farts out a dead horse goiter stricken acne encrusted ass. Spike Lee is just an over rated horse in a blanket. You can put all the fixings on it that you want, when it comes to Spike directing anything it&#39;s still all the fixings on a turd.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitathis movie was amazing
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshita10
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaHands down. Best movie of all time.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaYou gotta do with Alboz babe
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler<br>He didn&#39;t just stole the money, he also give a war criminal to the police so that the police leave him alone and goes after the war criminal, very smart.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaOK movie. 3/5. only worth watching once.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshita9gag
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert!<br><br>To all those that say they find this movie genius, answer me 4 questions:<br>1. Denzel talks to Owen, knows his voice, his height, how come he doesn&#39;t notice he&#39;s not among those that walk out in the end?<br>2. The hostages talked to each other, why can&#39;t they all identify each other in the end based on voice and stories told?<br>3. The police had access to the footages from opening up to the point the painters walk in. Surely they can do a headcount, let alone when Denzel walks around, you&#39;d expect him to do the same. Did they not compare the numbers with the number that exited the building?<br>4. Why did they not sweep the bank with police dogs looking for anyone hiding? Weren&#39;t they supposed to be thorough?<br><br>As a comment, Owen stays in there for a week, and so it happens that when he&#39;s just about to walk out Denzel shows up. What a coincidence, just so the diamond can be inserted into the pocket. Couldn&#39;t they have come up with something less forced, or just do it without that diamond?
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaBelow Mahognygoat said the movie was F....g perfect.¬† But I watched the movie and I SAW NO F****G in the movie - so WHAT movie was HE watching?
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion one of the best movies ever made, it has everything. Fucking perfect. 
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaFucking masterpiece, brilliant movie, and brilliant Spike
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaFucking boring movie !
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaCrime Drama Movies are my Personal Favorites! Spike Lee did a great job Filming this movie Another Spike Lee I&#39;ve not seen yet! I love Spike Lee! What a Cast of Actors in this movie!
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitarendered too bright. original looks darker&amp;better ;)
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshita&#39;Because I can&#39;. Best. Phrase. Ever.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaBrilliant movie. Highly underrated. The plot was well executed.
FSH-dbbiroIdelimeterByIshitaBUENA PELICULA

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s on the project x and 21 &amp; over movie, This guy was no sober, loves to party and shit

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaa future vince vaughn 
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThe name of the song is Feel Again by One Republic
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks amazing
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaSweet!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up for Mary Jane Watson! &lt;3
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaHaha he reminds me of a young John Cusack :)
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaI swear this kid is a mini version of Vince Vaughn.... wtf is he his son or someshit... surely
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaCannot wait to see this
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaWhy do I see Shia Labeouf?
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshita&quot;A walk to remember&quot; without the looming pain of death. joking))
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitashe is amazingly beautiful &lt;3
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitathat guy has Jonah Hill&#39;s voice.
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitadoes somebody know what&#39;s the song in the beginning of the trailer?

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitayup.. me too.. early shia.
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaLooks great ^_^
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaFirstly, i would never say someone is ugly as it is rude, and secondly the girl from the trailer has to be one of the prettiest and cutest girls i have ever seen. If i  met someone with a smile and eyes like that in real life, I would be all over her!!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaHe reminds me of Shia LaBeouf
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshita21 and over sequel
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaShailene Woodley is not ugly. She is very plain in the movie (for her character), but she also is not &quot;Hollywood&quot; poster child.... see how that turns out in Lindsey Lohan and Amanda Bynes..... this girl has her stuff together and we can be sure she won&#39;t turn into another 20s something trainwreck.

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song of kids of 88 called?

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaReally. Did they just show the whole movie in 2minutes and 21seconds!.
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell, this guy came out in Project X then boom his acting career took off? lol

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaDid i just see tris and peter making out? So awkward... O.o
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThe main guy looks like the love child of Cory Matthews and Shia LaBeouf.

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaHer name would be Amy
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaCant wait for the movie
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaAmy OMG &lt;3  she&#39;s on the show my life as a secret teen &lt;3
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaPeter? Tris? Why are you getting along?
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitawouldn&#39;t be surprised if Amy gets pregnant for being the American teenager
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer. Read the script last year and it blew me away. Can&#39;t wait for this! Does anyone know the song at the beginning of the trailer? It seems so familiar...

XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitathey look like they could be siblings... 
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaOK, let&#39;s stop for a second...why are all the Divergent movie stars cinematically circling each other? I mean, that&#39;s the second movie she&#39;s a romantic pair with a Divergent co-star, it&#39;s getting weird!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Feel Again&quot; by One Republic
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThis is good, but you showed way to much, i seen them meet, i see the reason they break it off, then i see alot more fucking trailers 
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitathis is quite sad... ive been expecting this for so long and now im not as excited..
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaOmg ! Yes! I cannot wait to see this movie!!!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaShailene is hot
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaSeems like a good movie
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaBetter Call Soul
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshita1:37 Saul Goodman is that you?
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaTouching and then it&#39;s the secret life :)
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaAt the beginning i thought it was a spin off of that random guy who parties alot from project x.
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaThis kid is alyways in party movies
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitamary jane!
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaDoes Amy die?
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaa  bit cliche
XDTBLSkUmYkdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s gonna play Peter and she is gonna play tris in divergent. I thought Peter had red hair...

LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaI love this movie so much
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaThe life the late Sir Seretse Khama
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaUn excellent film bas√© sur une histoire vraie, prouvant que l&#39;amour ne connait pas de race, ni de couleur de peau.
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaWhere to watch?
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaGreat movie! I would watch it again and again!
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaI wonder if Seretse Khama was a model for Black Panther.
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaand a black person  whos like mainly white girls this was amazing to see something not just about race but much more issues within all relationships
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaI just bought this yesterday,and have been wanting to to get it for a long time! I mean it just looks like a beautiful story...And also because with all of the racism and or race baiting going on in the United States today and people saying that different people are racist because they are a certain skin color...well it&#39;s just nice to find a movie with 2 people who just happen to be 2 different skin colors but they don&#39;t care about that,they don&#39;t see it..all they see is just 2 people in love!<br><br>It&#39;s kind of like the movie Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner in 1967 all they saw was 2 people in love...So what that were 2 different skin colors,but they didn&#39;t seem to care at all,because in the movie Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner the white girl just wasn&#39;t raised like that..and how refreshing!<br><br>I just wish more people could be raised like that,to just see people as people..and not what color they are..if we did this,this would be a much nicer world to live in. <br><br> Because it&#39;s not really a &quot;SKIN&quot; problem..but a heart problem and if you&#39;ve ever thought about it this way.. just for one moment take the word &quot;SKIN&quot; and remove the &quot;K&quot;..and it&#39;s really a &quot;SIN&quot; problem...right?

LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaAm I the only person who want watch this movie for the history and life of Seretse khama and don&#39;t fucking care any shit about race, racism, white people, black people or interracial relationships??? I think that people are so obsessed with human race
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaREVERSE RACISM at it&#39;s quintessential best!!
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaThis film bring wonderful news when they met each other in UK üíû and stick together as one. If they in America, it will be a whole different story when it comes to KKK group of thugs and so as their women that makes false accusation against the black men like Emmett Till.
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaIf they think this is gonna win an oscar they better get back to the storyboard with another movie
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaWow, that chick from gone girl&#39;s English accent is garbage. If it&#39;s real, then wow, it&#39;s still garbage. Sounds way too fake posh
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshita<b>A United Kingdom</b> (2017) || FULLMOVIE || <a href="https://plus.google.com/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/PNeL5cTi8mW">https://plus.google.com/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/PNeL5cTi8mW</a>
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaFunny how Hollywood is constantly pushing black male-white female relationships, whether it be in commercials, TV shows, or movies, they&#39;re constantly pushing these relationships on whites even though interracial relationships have higher rates of physical abuse and divorce, they never seem to push any other interracial combination like Mestizo woman-White man, Chinese man-African woman, or Jewish woman-Armenian man, such pairings are a one-off thing in media but it seems that you won&#39;t have to look far in the media to find a black man paired with a white woman. I wonder what kind of agenda would compel a group to fervently and consistently push interracial relationships as beneficial when there is only evidence to suggest that they&#39;re more likely to result in violence and failure?<br><br>You can give me the excuse that in this case the couple is actually historical, sure, that doesn&#39;t explain the pattern of TV shows and commercials showing these relationships which are entirely fictional.
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitathis looks amazing
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaAnd wow&#39;wow indeed it is a Hollywood movie one on one all over again I&#39;m just saying always, always read between the lines it is always in black and white on white paper in black ink just do your own homework/research for yourself and then and only then will you know the real &quot;TRUE STORY&quot; I&#39;m just saying in my opinion &quot;FOOD FOR THOUGHT&quot;
LKPDNKdpys8delimeterByIshitaHell yeah boiiiiiii
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitabro that little girl is literally old af lmao couple years to late
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t understand WHY they have to show the plot twist in the trailer...
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaImagine if they replace her as Esther
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOmfggggg
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaShe‚Äôs a great actress but why they would think this is a good idea to let her play a 10 years old‚Ä¶she looks exactly like her age, especially her sharp face shape, it looks way too weird than Twilight baby<br>And all the cm here saying the CGI or she looks like a little girl just like the first one (‚óèÔ∏é–î‚óèÔ∏é)?! How much they paid for those comments lol
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWtf  is the Esther actress grown up.or nah?
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWow nice remake
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThe first one was so good and doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough; the plot twist alone is something that I never would have guessed. Can‚Äôt wait to see this!<br>Edit: thanks for 23K likes!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaVERY EXCITED!!!!!!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaKind a like firestarter this is just a waste of money
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaHuh finally. Now it&#39;s better if u guys show us less things in trailers.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaNow we shall see what made Esther so deadly.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaExcited for this! Nice to see Julia stiles!!! üòä
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOkay I‚Äôll admit it took me like 30 seconds to know which movie is this lol but damn they did a great job I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWow,  I thought this movie was okay but man it&#39;s only 2 mins? Kinda short
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaLooks like the whole movie got spoiled.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitashe looks the same age as the mother lmao.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaIsabelle √© foda meo üî•ü§åüèª
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaso help me out here: didn‚Äôt she die?
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitashe&#39;s baaaaaack!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitai still remember watching orphan &amp; it shook me a lot, i dont know how this one&#39;s gona be, but im excited to see. i thought that girl died in that ice glacier but apparently not as we can see her in this next part!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThis is actually lookin pretty decent I‚Äôm kind of looking forward to this
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaüë©üèª‚Äçü¶∞‚ò†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaAlright, alright, alright let&#39;s see how this will turn turn out.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWow.....can&#39;t wait......üòò
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaShesss backkkk
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaAll these bots in the comments are not fooling anyone and is really F&#39;n pathetic. I thought the idea was to use cgi and trick lighting to maker look like she did 15 years ago.....I couldn&#39;t even make it through the trailer....this doesn&#39;t work. I would&#39;ve made it so the ice water made her start to age a little bit and now she&#39;s a teenager. Yeah it takes away from the realism of her disease but it&#39;s a horror movie. You&#39;re allowed to make up shit for a story. This was a really bad idea to do a prequel, or at least that was the idea originally . If it&#39;s a sequel and they actually did use the idea I just said or something similar....well shit...my mistake lol. It doesn&#39;t matter
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaI wonder if this is the same story that mentioned in first movie by Dr. V√§rava: &quot;She tricked a family in Estonia to adopting her, when she couldn&#39;t seduce the father, she murdered his entire family...and burn the house down.&quot;
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaSo the asian guys figures out shes not esther and is obviously dead..thanks trailer for ruining it.. ü§°ü§°
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaAyala porichtind karimeen varuthind Malayalam indo
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitafinally a prequel to this cult classic
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaLooks good
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWait.....what!!?
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaIntresting
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaNice
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaSUPER EXCITED FOR ESTHER! üëèüò±
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaReally liked the first one and thought it was criminally underrated. Looking forward to this one!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to watch Esther back in Actionüî•
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaVery good!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaEven more horrifying of a backstory than I expected! I love the insinuation that she killed a child and passed herself off as them.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThat‚Äôs the story of a trailer that just gave away 90 percent of the movie
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaoof she abouta eat this role yet again
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaAt least we already know they‚Äôre all going to die üëÅüëÑüëÅ
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaNo one needed this movie. No one
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaEven after 13 years, Fire in her Smile still üî•
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE WILL BE SO AMAZING I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT!!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaFuckin prequels‚Ä¶. Exactly what I hate ‚ò†Ô∏è
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaIsabelle Furhman was born for this role!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaHERE WE GO AGAIN BOYSSSSS
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaüòçüòç
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaVery excited for this movie
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaüáßüá∑NAO VEJO A HORA DE COMPRAR O INGRESSO √â IR AO CINEMA
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOMG! I can‚Äôt wait!üëßüèªüéÄüî™ü©∏üñ§
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWhile I liked Orphan which was released 13 years ago, Orphan: First Kill feels like it doesn&#39;t invoke any suspense, thrill or horror! But, who knows? The movie is already due to come out next month on Paramount+ so we&#39;ll see right away what it has to deliver!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOmg! Its creepy ‚ú®
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOnly OGs know &quot;who loevs daddy?&quot;
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaomg the trailer spoiling everything! üôàüôàüôà
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaNobody wanted this lol
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaI cannot with everyone acting like she actually looks like a little girl. She looks like a grown woman cosplaying as a little girl.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaI remember watching The Orphan a long time ago, and remember it was so disturbing. After watching this, I really can&#39;t wait to see it üôåüèª Was a bit surprised when it was announced they were doing a prequel, and now, I&#39;m excited for it.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOk this looks amazing tbh
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaEspero esse prequel desde 2009, s√≥ v√™m Esther.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaBut if this movie follows the previous family, we already know they all die so it kinda takes the suspense out of it.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaO.M.G!!!! I Love Esther
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaShe was destined to play this role!!!!!!! I remember watching the first one as a child and I still carry its intriguing effect. So excited for this one!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThis looks even better than the first one.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaüî•üî•üî•
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s very ironic Julia Stiles plays the mom cos in the Omen remake she also played a mom of Damien.. The killing has come full circle.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOkay, voc√™s tem minha aten√ß√£o
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaSo excited for this the first is underrated.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaEsse momento √© nosso!!!!!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOMG!!!!!!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaN√£o vejo a hora de assistir!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWow! They did a good job de-aging her. And Isabelle‚Äôs accent is still so spot on. üëåüèº So excited to see this! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWow this is a nice return!!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThey literally showed the whole movie in the trailer ...
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaFinally after 13 years of waiting, Esther is back and strong‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitawaiting a long time for this movie
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaLeena Klemmer had been posing herself as Esther the whole time.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaFrom the team who bought you twin warriors and two much
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitabasically a remake then?
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaIM SCREAMING!!!!!!! yes
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaEu amooo
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaESSE MOMENTO √â MEUU üáßüá∑üáßüá∑
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaSo shocked she still looks like her when she was a kid
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaWas excited for this, but it kinda seems like rehashing the same material.
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOMG
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaConsidering Isabelle Furhman is 5&#39;2&quot;, I wonder how much of the filming was done with her kneeling to be child height XD
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaLike they added The Glory of love song she sang from the alternate ending to the trailer , nice touch
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaOmg yess it&#39;s back for a sequel I love this movie I wnated a prequels  so badly üòç but I&#39;m concerned because it doesn&#39;t give really backstory more then it&#39;s givin sequel
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaThe first Orphan was a near perfect horror/thriller! Cannot wait for this!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaUn poco de CGI en la cara no le hubiera quedado mal
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaLove that no CGI was used to make her younger and instead its all lighting &amp; camera tricks
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaBig fan of the original, can‚Äôt wait!
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitaBrasileiros que est√£o esperando ansiosamenteeeee üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
_uX6of3vBu0delimeterByIshitayessssss
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitawow. you know it&#39;s gonna be good when the trailer makes you tear up. can&#39;t wait to see this!!

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitagives me an &#39;into the wild&#39; feeling. &lt;3
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@marxbroths remember, remember
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitafucking good

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@AbsoluteMenech If Chuck Norris was in this, his beard would have a jackhammer hidden in it to free himself.

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@AbsoluteMenech If Chuck Norris was in this, his beard would have a jackhammer hidden in it to free himself.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler Alert Lame-O!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThis is a true story....Aaron Ralston wrote a book about his experience.  Stuck for about 5 days, hand trapped under the boulder.  I got to meet him at a book signing for his book.  VERY neat guy.  Yes, he cut off his own hand to escape.  I told him I&#39;d have died in that canyon.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThe song is called Funeral by band of horses
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@freespace21 james franco. it said his name at least 5 times...
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s that guy from pineapple express! not seth rogen.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaat first i thought this was gonna be a comedy or something...then he fell in the canyon and i got teary eyed. i HAVE to see this.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@MrDeadhead83 probably, in real life the guy had to cut his arm of with a pen knife because it was dying away and was going to kill him...
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWow...I have a dark sense of humor...but when he got stuck I didn&#39;t laugh at all. I didn&#39;t even chuckle, that&#39;s some deep crap there.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIt a pretty bold move by the production company to release a movie 127 hours long. ; )
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWOW! This movie looks amazing! I have to admit, my eyes got a little watery at the end. Love that song! Great Great Band! Can&#39;t wait to see this!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitais that last shot of james franco him without an arm
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitathe Funeral by Band of Horses
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this??? 1:36
at first i thought it was The Prayer by Kid Cudi
but im guessin its the beat to the original song...lol
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@manbearpig900 hahhahhahahhaha
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@manbearpig900 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaI hear this song all over the place.  Sounds like Cold play or supertramp.  Someone tell me.THANX  BTW. I was shocked and amazed when this story broke.  I don&#39;t think I would have the courage to do what this guy did in order to survive. 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaDear Bear Grylls, next time please

SPOILER ALERT!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@west336699 With the help of about 2 producers, 3 cameramen, a professional cook and a safety team. Yeah probably.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Monkeyboy92037 Ha! I&#39;d rather get kicked in the teeth than watch those movies.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThe master Danny Boyle!

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@JakeVonRawro 
&quot;braking the bones in his wrist by snapping them against the boulder, he hacked through the skin, and finally succeeded in amputating his right hand and wrist.&quot;
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaUgh. Looks awful.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitathe song at the end is &#39;the funeral&#39; by band of horses :)
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Jammed9000 It&#39;s not like you meet someone twice in a DESERT.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita&quot;there is no force on earth more powerful than the will to live&quot; I think stephen hawking would disagree with that
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@shaboooya 
Not that I mind, I know the story, but still.  If its an epic spoiler, why the hell did you post it?  Thats a stupid, annoying move to any one who hasn&#39;t seen the spoiled movie in question.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitawooo!!! this will be another amazing movie =3 woooh . luvit!!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWait, THE Aron Ralston?
That&#39;s EPIC OH MY GOOOOD
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitais there the movie?
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWARNING! EPIC SPOILER!!!! Aaron amputates his lower right arm to free himself, and he does not die, in fact he is still alive as we speak
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@tuberpi yeah me too!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@zizotherollingstoner Band of Horses - The Funeral
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE NAME OF THE SONG PLEASE !!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@tuberpi 

November 5th
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIt seems like they took quite a few liberties with the story. I wonder if the ending will be the same as in real life....
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking amazing!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaOf course anything with James Franco is amazing, but honestly even if I didn&#39;t consider that, it looks like a great movie.  Not to mention the same director from Slumdog.  I can&#39;t wait for to watch this :D
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of Into the Wild the boy Chris Mccandless.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@gopats1208 The song at the end is &quot;The Funeral&quot; by Band of Horses, great song.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaCl√©mense Po√©sy ‚ô•
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@smellyshite aron ralston
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@jimmypetelol what do you call the accual guy 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaI spoiled the story of this movie by wikipedia the actual guy
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaChuck Norris would eat through his own arm
and then grow it back
and then throw the rock into the sun.

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Mactank62 to be fair, De Niro has had his bad roles. i mean, Frankenstein? really?
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaPeople talk about Bear Grylls and what a badass he is, I would like to see him do this. Gentlemen, this is Aron Ralston&#39;s world, we&#39;re just living in it.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco almost failed acting school in New York. whats odd is that he went to school this past year after being full blown famous. he got a d. bahaha guess he doesnt need it.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitalooks incredible ! band of horses epic with this !
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaGuys its oscar winner AR Rahman...wow souuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnn trackkkkkkkkkkkkk
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome, can&#39;t wait to see it. Thanks Peter Rallis!

OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaoh man i love band of horses!!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@thebradchannel this looks nothing like buried
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWhats the first song in this called? 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks pretty damn epic
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Niggs3000 ME, I didn&#39;t know and that was probably the climax of the story! i hate drama anyway, though, so whatever.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitajames franco wooo! ...i like freaks and geeks...
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@VYP3R22 go watch transformers 2....
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaimagine how difficult its to make a movie this days 1 actor, 2 girls, a canyon and he gets stuck for 1h and 10minutes of the movie, pfffffffffffffffffffffff BOOOOOORING
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitalooks AWSOME goin to c it at the london film festival!!!!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@JAWs313 one of my favorite songs before I saw this trailer)
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@aznbl4ckdud369 Band of Horses - Funeral (one of my favorite songs before I saw this trailer)
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIf u read below apparently the song is the funeral by the band of horses
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaRedbull tastes like shit.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaawww i cant believe this story is true poor guy.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitathis looks like one hell of a good movie
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitapause at 2:22
you see his new climbing/hook arm!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaawesome awesome awesome.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitasick movie sicksicsickscisck
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIt looks soo fucking good.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert: he cuts off his arm.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty fantatsic
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitawhat song is at the end of the trailer???sum1 plz tell me!!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIf franco gets nominated this year itll be amazing. 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitahe chops his own arm off and lives with a bionical arm, the real guy is alive and well today
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@WeThrowRiverside NO SPOILERS!!!! COULDN&#39;T YOU TELL HIM THAT IN A PM?!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer made me cry.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitawhat happens 
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaI always thought James Franco resembled Heath Ledger in many ways.  Both are extremely talented actors who would go beyond the call of duty to play their characters right. 

Knowing that James Franco was chosen by Christopher Nolan to be in Inception only to bow out because of other commitments further proved to me how talented he is.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@natshevchenko
the Song is Band of Horses - The Funeral
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve heard/seen the real story on tv. scary.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaWho know song this movie? thank you
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaI love the way James Franco takes roles that shrug off that teenage heart throb image of his, and confirm him to be the brilliant actor he truely is. 

Keep a close eye on this guy&#39;s tremendous career, that will be as big as De Niro&#39;s. Trust me.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita7th person to like this video!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaI get the feeling he has a threesome with those chicks.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Niggs3000 You summed up my thoughts exactly.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@blookoko Really, to me it looks like one a those situations where it takes a ton of creativity just to make the movie NOT a ton of crap. So yea, they probably WILL make this awesome, but even with flashbacks (pretty much all this movie is going to have) can it hold my attention? Nobody knows. anyway...
JAMES FRANCO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitai love james franco! &amp; this looks amazing!
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshitaIf he has to cut off his hand, I&#39;m out. I could watch a hundred babies get get shot to death but someone get&#39;s their finger cut off I can&#39;t look.
OlhLOWTnVoQdelimeterByIshita@Joshalots OMG YOU ARE SO RIGHT! I totally agree with you.

paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer did nothing for me.. UNTIL the end when the little girl ran and turned into that scary bitch omg...
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIn the Conjuring it is said that doll is a demon and now in this movie the doll ¬†is a spirit/ghost ? oh boy

paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaStupid,, they put the most suspenseful scene at start of the movie... what dumb asses...
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/paFgQNPGlsg?t=2m10s">2:10</a> You Better Not Be Shuttin No Doors!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThe last part was funny as hell XD
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this doll and chucky to team up.. they would be one hell of a pair
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaShit if theres a scream next door im staying my ass in the house¬†
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitadoll from a haunted house two lol
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie isn&#39;t scary at all. It looks really gay 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaLooks like some &quot;Boo! Haunted House&quot;-tier unscary shit.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaAnd the doll is fuckin creepy
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI wanna see it but I&#39;m only 10 :(
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI like this trailer for some reson XD
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaOmg that made me jumpüò±
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one who was thinking of swinging a right hook at her when she ran threw the door way <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a>
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThey need to cut down on the amount of scares they put on their trailers cause with the conjuring, most of the scares were in the trailer and when I watched the movie, it made it less scary cause I&#39;ve seen it before. 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIn the movie they should tear the whole house down and break everything and save the doll for last because the doll doesn&#39;t look oddly suspicious whatsoever. Even though it showed up out of nowhere.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song that starts at like <a href="http://youtu.be/paFgQNPGlsg?t=1m00s">1:00</a>
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThat last part made me cry like a bitch, cant wait to see this movie!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita2.09 to 2.17
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg&amp;t=0m43s">0:43</a> yes of course, ¬†I just gonna put a doll creepy as hell in the room of my little daughter, why not?
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI FUCKING HATE DOLLS
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitawhy are white people in horror movies so stupid when it comes to trying to survive?¬†<br>¬† ¬†&quot;Hello? Is anybody there?&quot; why the fuck would u give urself out like that? dumbass.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI loved the Conjuring, the best horror movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time... but this just seems like a James Wan wannabe (pardon the pun). The director is trying too hard to emulate Wan&#39;s style... it just looks a bit dumb.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaScary movies for me is NO NO for miss Scardie cat hereüíÅüôÖüôç..... I rather watch with my friends and cover my face in their shoulder 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaeven the preview sucks.¬†
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIs that Chucky&#39;s new Bae? PSH
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI swear I&#39;m not trying to be tough because every scary movie trailer I&#39;ve seen has scared the crap outta me,but this...just doesn&#39;t scare me :/ it has all the cliches(creepy doll,stupid main characters,woman being dragged on the floor while screaming,anticipation for something bad to happen ex.when she was sowing,creepy woman in a white dress,priest,MC moving but stay possessed, baby in danger) did I forget anything?
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaHoly. Shit. <a href="http://youtu.be/paFgQNPGlsg?t=2m16s">2:16</a> 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the middle of the day and im scared...#dontjudge
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaOh my GAWD 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe I just screamed at the top of my lungs,&amp;  Its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a>pm.this is too scary for me
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not impressed
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThe movie is just not about the doll. Also not a chucky copy.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaFuck yah!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT!!!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaNope... not doin this .. nope.. just nope!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitathere&#39;s a reason I have pediophobia.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaOMG!!! I want to watch it!!! I am not coward! &gt;=] doll¬†is creepy, and I won&#39;t buy¬†doll or bring doll on my bedroom. I¬†really hate doll!! ¬†the last part scared me!! I hate crazy girl. I said who is little girl? she ran to woman and door was closed. I was o,o then girl changed different dark girl then she would attack woman. I screamed. I would throw my laptop. I woke my puppy up. he was jumping lol I said kai, I am sorry to wake you. I am fan of horror movies but¬†not zombies¬†and devils movies.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaI saw like the first 3 seconds of the trailer before I skipped it and I was like &quot;That movie is not scary.&quot; Now I watched the whole trailer and guess who isn&#39;t sleeping tonight! XD <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%232scary4me">#2scary4me</a>
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg&amp;t=1m04s">1:04</a> reminds me of that ghost girl from mark apsolon
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaUgh, every horror flick ever.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this movie <br>
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaWhy the hell would you keep the damn doll after a maniac psychotic bitch tried to kell you for it?! This movie...fuck that to nopeville!...Can&#39;t wait to see it!!  
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paFgQNPGlsg&amp;t=2m12s">2:12</a> That Part Scared The Shit Out OF me !! XD
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIf anyone is wondering what that great song is, it&#39;s by The flamingos: I only have eyes for you. (Thank me later)
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThats my name :(
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaSCUSE ME, why did she keep the doll?
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaAlways wondered why The Conjuring left the Annabelle story out of the movie when they included it in the beginning. 
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitawhy do they get different paranormal research people? like wasn&#39;t the annabelle case supposed to be handled by the guys from the conjuring, and weren&#39;t the haunted people two chicks...????
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaSo scary!       nightmaresssssssss
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t that the doll from A Haunted House 2 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaKill it before it lays eggs!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of those classic Horror movies (like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Chucky, etc., etc.). I wanna see it! XD
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://youtu.be/paFgQNPGlsg?t=2m06s">2:06</a> u see a demons face behind ANNABELLE, looks legit!!!!! It&#39;s very quick but give it a couple tries and you&#39;ll see it
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitathat last part of the video ... well played
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitalast bit looked really bad¬†
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaNOPETY NOPE.<br>I guess the doll falling down in front of the door was a LITTLE surprising but not scary in the least. ¬†It didn&#39;t even move it&#39;s head or anything..(LAMMMMEEE) ¬†and near the end, Did anyone else get a SCARY MOVIE vibe when that girl was running as the door closed? ¬†I was just waiting for the&quot; HE HE CHAMONE&quot; michael jackson sound effect to finish it off!
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song?
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaWhat is it with James wan and dolls, women in dresses and creepy seventies music?
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaIt looks very good.¬†
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaBefore trailer : I&#39;m gonna watch this because it doesn&#39;t look so scary. After trailer : NOOOOOOOOOPE. :D
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaFreaky!!!!! And I still have the Annabelle doll from The Conjuring at home. &quot;I swear I threw that out!&quot;
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaMeh, dolls aren&#39;t scary.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitais ¬†this movie old beacouse i swear i saw this movie where some demon is trying to steal a baby then she does and the woman and husband go on a man hunt for her and then they go to this place then the woman and demon talk to each other and she ask ¬†why are you after my baby spoiler if it is¬†
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaa Haunted house 2 :p abiguel
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitafunny I don&#39;t remember the &quot;REAL&quot; story this is based of having all that happen in it.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaMe asuste xD
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaPretty much looks like crap. ¬†However the genre is not my cup of tea.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaHoly.Shit.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaWhy ruin some nice scares in the trailer? Don&#39;t they have faith in the film? Cinematographers usually don&#39;t make the best directors but I do have hope though.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaDEAD SILENCE
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaAburridooo.
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaim gonna watch it o___o
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaEff that last part man...

paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaFuck why did I click on this....
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitai cant wait
paFgQNPGlsgdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit, the last bit was scary.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaits always the stupid kid
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaand here&#39;s the twist.... the son kills the family...... which is why he let the black guy in....
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitahmm i think this movie smells like trouble, god help us
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaFinally ! Another movie like the strangers!!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI already hate the kid in this movie just from the trailer.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshita@CianMacCecht maybe a large amount of working people die which would solve unemployment
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitai actually laughed out loud at that.  perfect 

K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLoomis col
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI like the concept, but I hope it doesn&#39;t turn into one of those movies that glorifies America.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks sick I love it
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWHAT THE FUCK??? This is fucked up. Allowing murder one night a year? Wowww
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitamost likely
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaSee what happens when you have undisciplined kids.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis look really interesting and intense, I‚Äôm definitely seeing it in cinemas. 


K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitawhy did it have to be a black guy tho ?
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitai understand how you&#39;re feeling bro
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWTF
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI would throw acid into people&#39;s faces
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaMay be a dumb idea, but im still gonna see it
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaif this really happened i think there would be more drugs and less freaky muder
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI want to find the studio executive who green lighted this garbage and punch him straight in the vagina.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaGood original concept for a film but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s glorifying murder,I think it&#39;s meant to make you think what a bad idea it would be. That&#39;s what dystopian fiction is all about.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitavery unique concept
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshita1:20 that bitch
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitalooks good
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaGood cast, terrible plot
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis is so sad!! :(
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitai think that this is actually a pretty cool idea
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitathis looks so good
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitapretty cool idea.  for a movie, i meant for a movie.  jesus christ people. 
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one who thinks this movie is gloryfying murder.....
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s a cute little idea with that purge thing o_O
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaimagine if that was real. the amount of ice cream I could steal
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re projecting.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaMan if this was real.... 

K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaahhhh queen lannister
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI did not see that coming...looks like a good movie but shit if this was real.....
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis seems like its going to be a really good movie!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaHence why this is a work of fiction and not a historical documentary.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it have to matter? I honestly didn&#39;t notice till you pointed it out. Stop caring what race people are. Problem solved.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitawhy dont they just sleep it out
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaNot a sir. And you are welcome.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaDid you not notice the film is set in suburbia? The obvious subtext of this film is that the people who are hit hardest by the purge are minorities.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWhy can&#39;t he? Racist...
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaIt looks pathetic, those who are going to enjoy this movie e think that it is awesome should be locked up.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThe strangers go to Washington D.C.?
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWe keep complaining of recycled ideas, now we got served.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be awesome
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaIt looks interesting but the idea of legalizing murder even for 12 hours is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard of, I&#39;m just saying.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitalooks fucking awesome omg
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a crap film
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWaaaaah
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaso another movie that happened because some kid fucked up everything and got his family killed.... meh
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitawhat....the....fuck...
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t need to watch the movie anymore. :3
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLooks crazy (seeing it)
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaOh god. Are the crazies here yet? The conspiracy theorist? Yep. they are. Color me surprised. not. 
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLena Headey is so damn fine.

K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshita#purgegamers #YOLO
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great O.O
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaIt would be awesome if that happened in real life :D
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s just a movie
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re Kidding? .... Right? 
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaLooks really cool. It&#39;s nice to see a fairly original concept. 
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitahmm original
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaJoin the UN Peacekeepers...those assholes do shit like this all year round.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI wouldn&#39;t worry about that, I could always try to kill those people next year.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshita@theeliteninjas: The Strangers? Maybe! If so I thought the same thing
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaSorry to get a little dark here but, I live in a world of law. I think about things, like killing, or raping that girl I met on the bus yesterday, but I would never hurt anyone, because I&#39;m afraid of the repercussions. If I could just get one day a year to release all this pent up animal nature, I would be happy for the rest of the year and I would be an all around better, more motivated person. And if you disagree, on a day like that, you can always find me and kill me, or at least try.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaOh, I do? Care to explain? Little boy.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaprobably he live in world where always sun shines, unicorns fly around and rainbows are everywhere :D
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitamost of the movies hollywood is producing are either reality that&#39;s absconded from the people or something that&#39;s gonna happen in the future being it like some warning or some shit like that  !!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaRich guy is stealing money or in high end position that his coworkers want to kill him. The guy they let in the house is one of them, let&#39;s everyone in. Then the family lives or dies, or just the dad lives. The end
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaI was dreaming about this idea yesterday......... WTF?
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWTF happened to the door at 2:00
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWTF you need to grow up you&#39;re self
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThe first few seconds I thought they&#39;d got rid of all the black people, but I guess that a horror movie without any actual conflict wouldn&#39;t be much of a movie.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis loooks likes a sequeal too the strangers ?
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaTotally! I could actually see this working though, that&#39;s the thing.. 364 Days of peace a year, then on the 365th just buy yourself a nice semi-auto along with a L118 Sniper and you&#39;re set.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaYou don&#39;t need to be a part of it, but this country needs something like this. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never played a violent videogame or watched an action film. It&#39;s not enough, something like this... It will be good for us.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWTF you need to grow up.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaYeah. I&#39;m sure that if this sort of thing was real, all the rich pricks who could afford it would have panic rooms with ultra adamantium electrified walls and would have already locked themselves inside before this &quot;purge&quot; even began so if the bad guys broke in they couldn&#39;t get through to them in a hundred years, never mind twelve hours -- and they wouldn&#39;t set foot outside until the whole thing was over.

In fact, rich pricks like these already have panic rooms.

And wasn&#39;t this on Star Trek?
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshita2:05 crazy as fuck ...creepy
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaMasks remind me of the Strangers film :P
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWow, looks fun as fuck!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaThis needs to be a real thing!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitawhat kind of goverment is that ?? all crimes are legal ?? 
 terrorist everywhere
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaAWWW that looks like that film i can&#39;t remenber the name of it but this looks fun and scary 
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWicked !
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitafinally something new, and Ethan Hawke is in it... I&#39;ll be waiting to watch this!
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaSeems like my kinda film
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitalooks nice.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaSeems like something America would do‚Ä¶ teehee

K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaNice thriller.
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaWooooooow all legal activity is free for all for 12 hours sheshhhhhhh can&#39;t wait for this
K0LLaybEuzAdelimeterByIshitaseems like an interesting concept
