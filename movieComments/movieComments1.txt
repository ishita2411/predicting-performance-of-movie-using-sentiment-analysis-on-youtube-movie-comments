KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else think Kevin was Michael Fassbender?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI was on board until he started &quot;altering his body chemistry with his mind&quot;
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaMy god professor what happened to you?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaWhy won&#39;t Shyamalan just quit?? Damn
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaApocalypse really messed this guy up.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaomg this look good
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m kinda hoping someone gets buried alive
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaGuess I&#39;m  not the cult of personality anymore.........
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaJust send in Vegeta to take care of this :P
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaAlso why didn&#39;t this trailer just spoil what I think will be most of the movie.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see, a review of this movie because there is no way I&#39;m going to see it day 1 without knowing what I can going into.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaoh he!! naw !
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaYay... more guys abducting kids.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita:I
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS EPIC! @0 @
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaM Night Shyamalan&#39;s Salad Fingers.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap it&#39;s m. Night shalayma this is gonna be the best comedy EVER so hyped for a good laugh
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaNope.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitait was alright, BUT NOT MORE MOVIES
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaYo, why am I hearing the Windows fault/exception sound?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m laughing so hard right now!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaMPD films are the hottest
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaThe scariest part of the trailer was seeing M. Night Shamalyn&#39;s name.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Pardon me sir I think you have the wrong car.&quot; Please I&#39;d be out of that car when I saw him approaching the driver seat
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaOh, so you caught on to me you little shit.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIpGKumxiGg&amp;t=1m56s">1:56</a> girl on the right is fine
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitasomething roger from american dad will do....
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI fucking hate trailers, they literary spoil everything, the trailer should of ended with the girl crying in the car. that would of let us think, &#39;&#39;what the fuck, i gotta watch the movie to figure why shes crying&#39;&#39; no instead, they show literally every fucking scene in the movie that would have been a &#39;&#39;twist&#39;&#39;! I honestly find trailers these days revolting! its as if directors have no hope for the general public and just SPOON FEED EVERYTHING TO US INTO A FUCKING TRAILER.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaProfessor X has gone crazy? <br>Can&#39;t wait for theaters.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaProfessor X has gone mad! Well, We knew that was going to happen.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitadid anyone else think it was the cellar by Natasha Preston?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIpGKumxiGg&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> that ass tho!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI was excited about this movie until I realised it was a Shyamalan vehicle. Weak
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaBebé James
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaDamn it Barry, stop fucking up the timeline!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI hope trailers will go one shade dumber and even show the very end, then we can all stop going to movies for 3 years. Then maybe the industry will start being run by talented people, not focus groups.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitathis movie is for perverts.. a pervert director made it and hired some perverted people.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaHollywood already made this movie aka Sybil, even that movie was stretching out the truth for entertainment/horror purposes
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitathis movie can fuck off, making people with multiple personality disorder seem dangerous and horrifying
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaDamn it, Xavier. I tould you it was too much of fucking around with mind games!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaOMFG THIS WAS ON MY ADVERTISMENT AND I WAS GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL AND IM LATE NOW I WAS SO DISTRACTED I WOULD TOTTALY WATCH THIS MOVIE
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitathis is what happen when you read to many minds
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a great concept but the bit about him turning into the &quot;beast&quot; at the end sounds absolutely retarded, hopefully it&#39;s not too stupid.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaIs this supposed to be a dark comedy?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaWell color me pissed off... way to completely misrepresent D.I.D. guys.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita&quot;The Human brain is the most complex object in the universe&quot;..... smh that&#39;s some border line retarded shit.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaDuuuuuude!!! this is an award winning movie!! amazing so far. i hope the movie is as great as the trailer !!!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaThis movie puts mental illness in such a bad like I&#39;m appalled
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI have same disorder but I am not like this. this movie is just fantasy. in the real life thigs not happen like this. know one can understand that if you are not mad
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitathis is me
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI think me many people and me barely feel shit when it comes to movies anymore but this actualy freaked and creaped me the fuck out i gotta see this film anyone got the same feeling or maybe its just specifically creaping me out
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaXavier what have you done
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really fun and creepy.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaDank
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitait is good to see M.Night again.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaso bad
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaRed Lips Always Lie! WUBWUB WUB
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Hey, so I know this random guy just entered our car and started attacking my friends in the back, and possibly even killed the owner of said car....but I think I&#39;m just going to sit here and watch him do this, while crying.&quot;<br><br>Also, this movie looks like it has potential. Let&#39;s just hope that it won&#39;t be just that, potential.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaMeal toys how to make toys
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaSigh....Another great movie trailer that will probably be attached to another meh grade movie.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaX-men:days of the origins of the past in the future of flashback. That is how Xavier started.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaplease make a southpark reference 😂😂😂
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaAw. the description sounded so good, but the bad science sounds so...bad.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI am excited to watch this but a little worried its not going to be as good as the trailer looks
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaLogan &quot; Professor whats Worng&quot;<br>Professor &quot;I haved fuked with to many minds!!&quot;
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaJessica sula looks amazing
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaButters! That&#39;s it mister, you are grounded!!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaLegion the son of Professor X
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s gonna&#39; turn out to be a Werewolf.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaWhen The Village was marketed as a creature feature, Shyamalan knew his movie was doomed and later often wished he could change the way it was marketed. I bet this movie has its best moments hidden and it will be completely different than what the trailer implies it to be!!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaGulp.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaLooks interesting but unrealistic doesn&#39;t matter tho if it&#39;s good
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaSo... why not lure him into the room while he&#39;s going through the kid perosonality, run out, lock the door and skedaddle?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaAnya Taylor is bae
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaA severe condition of bipolar to me
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI unfortunately saw this trailer that was part of the previews while seeing Ouija Origins of Evil yeah James McAvoy is creepy but I feel like it&#39;s miss marketed and might of showed too much of it. This is why trailers should be avoided.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI need to see it 💕
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaM. Night Shalayman, welcome back. This is your field and stick to what you know best... BRINGING OUT GREAT THRILLERS. James Mcavoy, you are fabulous, I hope for you many awards in your future.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaDude holy crap what&#39;s the name of Professor X&#39;s current actor?<br>He&#39;s honestly incredible and, judging by the trailer, this is totally his role.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t what for the plat twist at the end
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita34 comments?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t! I can&#39;t watch this trailer! I&#39;m so excited for this movie I just have to be okay with the first trailer and let it be. I&#39;m sure its a good trailer but I just can&#39;t..
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaWe just want to see the awful things he does to the girls. Do they show any of that?
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really torn about this. The first time I saw the original trailer, I was stoked, right up to the moment they revealed it is a shymamdadfbas movie. But this trailer makes it look even better, and I don&#39;t know if I should give him another shot. What is everyone else doing?? Are we going to risk M. not fucking it up again??
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaThis sounds psychologically taut.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita&quot;human brains are the most complex objects in the universe&quot;.......is this a joke? I hope so
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaLooks so good and people who saw this at a preview showing a little while ago said it&#39;s M. Nights best work in years
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita1 out of 3 of me should like this
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaIf it&#39;s a parody I&#39;m in.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaSold!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaThanks for spoiling the window reveal. Trailers are fucking trash.
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitabilly milligan!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshita&quot;Can change their body chemistry with their thought!&quot; lol ok. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SIX PACK ABS! SIX PACK ABS! SIX PACK ABS!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaXavier playing Legion
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaSe ve curada :B
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaIf the studio had any confidence in this they wouldnt be releasing it in January,that month is used for emptying out the trash!
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaso, charles xavier went apeshit
KIpGKumxiGgdelimeterByIshitaErr, so what is it? YOU GOT REKT BITCHES!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d96cjJhvlMA&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> mark you can see the collector from the end credit scene from Thor 2 The Dark Lord. This pretty much guarantees we will see another artifact for the infinity gauntlet in this film. It&#39;s going to be more essential that we are giving it credit for! I can&#39;t wait for this movie!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaNOVA OUTFITS! Maybe a sighting of the hero himself!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaComedy
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see this movie! Looks fun 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaIs that Batista as that muscly red guy
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI like the Theme Music a lot !!!!! :D
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaIs that Batista? I want to see him do the Batista Bomb 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaYES! ;D
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaтолько енот эпичен остальное как-то уныло
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d96cjJhvlMA&amp;t=0m47s">0:47</a> Drax - aKa the Destroyer - aKa Dave Bautista! :)
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaWow...looks like Steam arrested them (looks at John C. Reilly&#39;s chest logo)
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaNIN - Love is Not Enough lol
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita8-1 is way so far away!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Farscape, but I&#39;m pretty pumped for it anyway! And I do miss Farscape too.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaok so here&#39;s amovie that doesn&#39;t take itself seriously cuz it&#39;s based on a comic book, I love that, why didn&#39;t the Fantastic Four movies do that?
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaONLY 22,000 views for this trailer channel ON THE MARVEL CHANNEL.<br><br>well I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter. As long as the hype is everywhere, the way marvel sees it.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita¿Guardians of the Galaxy? prepare to guard yourself 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaidenticos a los del comic
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaall i can say is if this movie becomes a blockbuster hit along with ant man, then that&#39;ll only further put pressure on dc and wb to put out some damn good superhero movies, as it&#39;s sad that they still cant&#39; make a successful superhero film outside of batman and superman.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaLooks funny. Willing to give it a chance. Like OcihEvE wrote: Marvel force fed fruit loops to the Firefly crew. If it&#39;s half as good as firefly was - I&#39;m in!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitala vere por batista
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaAAAK!!<br>Marvel force fed fruit loops to the Firefly crew for a year.<br><br>I R confuzed.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaSee, it&#39;s things like this trailer that make me want to pull a Captain America and get frozen until this movie comes out.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaCould anyone tell me what the music at the beginning of the trailer is? Not Hooked on a Feeling, but the instrumental when he&#39;s picking up the orb.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been trying to give this movie a chance since I never heard of these marvel characters before. Now that the trailer is out I still don&#39;t get whats great about it. 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaResearched this for the 3rd time and realized The Collector from the end of Thor: The Dark World was there<br>
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaAwesome!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a stupid comedy! FAIL!!!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaAugust 1st needs to get the f**k here already! 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see it.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaКруто и Весело!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaSploosh! 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitathis is going to be so awesome!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI love the music for thid already, really can&#39;t wait for this :D
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaawesome!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was a joke that the earlier leaked trailer sported the &#39;Hooked on A Feeling&quot; song. It really wasn&#39;t! And made me laugh two-fold.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite marvel team in the Marvel Universe 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaooohhhh yessss
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaSeems like it might be interesting. Let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t bomb.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaIs there a reason why Marvel UK account uploads the trailer 1 day earlier than this Marvel &quot;USA&quot; account? It was the same for the first Captain America: Winter Solider trailer.<br>Or is this because if Jimmy Kimmel account?
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitadc take note
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaHonestly, one of the main reasons I&#39;m excited for this movie is all of the Nova tie-ins.<br>Annihilus story line?<br>YES.<br>PLEASE.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitathis looks absolutely weird.... but honestly I&#39;m still gonna see cause it also looks good and i don&#39;t understand.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve never really read the Guardians of the Galaxy comic book, i&#39;ve only read them on cross overs with other superheroes like the avengers and spiderman ,and i&#39;ve researched a little about them on wikipedia ,on saturday i&#39;ll probably go out and get some at my comic book store , but if anyone has read them , can you recommend me where to start please.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaAlso I love the fact that Chris Pratt from Parks and Recreation is the star of this movie LOL he&#39;s so funny... But you would think they would have Bradley Cooper in a more substantial role than a CGI Raccoon Man but I will personally reserve further Judgment until I see this movie...
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaNa expectativa de um grande, bem humorado e divertido filme!<br><br>Grande trailer!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaNever heard of Guardians of the Galaxy till now but Marvel has been doing great the last couple of years cranking out these Superhero movies if they are gonna incorporate this into the Avengers universe that&#39;s awesome. I heard the plotline is they are carrying a very powerful object one of the infinity stones like the Tesseract from Captain America First Avenger &amp; The Avengers and the Aether from Thor the Dark World. Given the ending of Thor the Dark World that guy saying 1 down 5 to go. I bet Avengers 3 after Age of Ultron that guy gets his hands on all 6 Infinity Stones and gains ultimate power then The Avengers gotta stop him...
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaDat Nine Inch Nails.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaAmazing~!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaMeh. I&#39;m still excited more for captain America the winter soldier and amazing spiderman 2 and age of ultron but still keen to watch this. 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitawell done Marvel, genuinely excited for this one
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaBatista 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaOSOM
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaOOGA CHAKA OOGA-OOGA OOGA CHAKA
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThe song is: &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot; by Blue Swede. 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitalol
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pleased with Groot and Rocket&#39;s appereances.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaGotta see this!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita.... marvel is sleeping, to make this look so lame
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaHonestly why is broadly cooper playing rocket raccoon. Rocket raccoon is so pose to have an Australian accent 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitawho is the villain?
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThe song is called: <br>Hooked on a feeling<br>By Blue Swede
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaGuardians of the galaxy? really? how many comics this series sold? You need to be a hardcore Marvel fan to know about them. what about a good Xmen movie instead? I mean, they are the best of marvel universe. These comic book movies are mediocre at best.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaWhatever music is playing here, does NOT match the theme for this trailer!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThe song ? Anyone know ?
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not the only one who saw the collector right
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitai want to see this movie now!!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaLoads were blown and dreams came true when this trailer was released. 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d96cjJhvlMA&amp;t=1m59s">1:59</a> The Collector!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaBjörn Skifs FTW!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaCANT WAIT!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaTHE AVENGERS IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE...<br><br>...yeah, I&#39;m gonna see it.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaA raccoon with guns sounds like a good movie to me
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaare richard rider and/or sam alexander in it as novas 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s gunna be a laugh, I haven&#39;t read the comics but I&#39;ll fling out £20 or so to go see it
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaLooking good so far.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI really like the Trailer. It&#39;s very funny and awesome. :)
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThis film is going to be legend........wait for it..........dary!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaYeah, that looks god, but we&#39;re still waiting for a Deadpool movie.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaOkay seriously EVERYONE support this movie please 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE THIS TRAILER!!!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason Groot is in this movie is for his sex appeal. 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaI hope marvel doesn&#39;t change the way the characters look now especially star lord
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaLooks good so far.  I just hope Marvel doesn&#39;t go too far toward comedy (every movie of this type -- Yes, I&#39;m thinking of you Man of Steel -- needs some charm, but no more than, say, 20-15% of the film) and forget that ultimately the Guardians of the Galaxy are still a superhero team doing generally superhero-ish things.  But, Marvel hasn&#39;t really gone wrong yet so I am going to believe the best until I have reason not to.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaDamn that song is catchy!!!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaTwo words -  Fucking awesome 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaThis is great!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitalol this looks amazing and hilarious
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaIch versteh nur nicht, warum der deutsche Trailer schon draußen ist, komplett synchronisiert. Trotzdem denke ich, dass Guardians of the Galaxy ein super Film wird :D
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitain the 3rd part of Avengers I&#39;m pretty sure they will be in it.
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitaSo if the Nova Corps are in this movie, does that mean we will See either Richard Rider or Sam Alexander as Nova in the future 
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitahope it&#39;ll be good!
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshitanice !
d96cjJhvlMAdelimeterByIshita1st comment. Looks cool

yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaWait, so the lost city of Z has Dudley Dursley in it, even though Z looks like Harry&#39;s lightning scar. And the lost city of D has Harry in it even though D stands for Dudley

yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaFawcett was pioneer of his time. He was the one to look at native people as advanced civilization. This was time where racism and white superiority was rampant and anything different was considered beneath the white race. Everyone else was savage, stupid and  freakshow. The civilization is not defined by just certain parameters. It is a complex combination of social, economic, political and technological advancements. it can&#39;t be seen through racial lens. He opened the door for future archeological discoveries and explorations.

yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaLooks cool!  “The Lost City of Z” is based on a true story about Percy Fawcett, who would stop at nothing to discover a lost civilization in the Jungles of the Amazon Rainforest.  It looks like a very dangerous journey.  Director James Gray tells a similar story in his follow-up movie “Ad Astra”, which unlike this film, was based on an idea he had since 2011.  It’s amazing how trying to find a lost civilization can have the same effects on trying to prove the existence of alien life.
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaTom Holland
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaThanks Joe Rogan
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaWait is this based on that percy guy who went into the amazon and basically disappeared in like early 1900s?
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaThis movie reminds me of the explorer/adventurer Leonard Clark who searched the Amazon for the Lost City of Gold and said he found it, later in Venezuela, he drowned searching for diamonds, mans reach can sometimes exceed his grasp
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaThis film is a masterpiece.
yqGDNvX1F4gdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a top notch movie! Wonder if it answers the questions about whatever happened to him.

avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitanot bad, looking forward to the movie
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaOberyn? Must watch!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> It&#39;s the Chinese Power Rangers, lol
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaSicarios soundtrack
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT TO SEE LUHAN!!!!!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaPeople complaining about whitewashing because this is the story of europeans traveling to china. Such small closed minds. People travel, get over it, seeing foreigners on ancient cultures can be amazing for storytelling, really looking forward to this movie!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHonestly I&#39;m going to see the movie just for LuHan, but the script and special effects looks awful... Sorry not sorry.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaMy God it&#39;s Jason Bourne
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaman the dialogue atrocious
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad they have some white people in this movie otherwise I wouldn&#39;t watch it.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaAlso, good to see Oberyn has recovered from his headache
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaIs that what Trump thinks Mexicans look like? Giant fucking lizards?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaThe Warriors look like power Rangers. 😂😂 Either way, I can&#39;t wait for the sjw&#39;s who support black actors talking over white superheroes, but hate white actors being in an Asian movie
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI wasn&#39;t aware that the power rangers have a part in this movie
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaSo thats how the dinosaurs got extinct
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> Power Rangers?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaFirst, Jeremy Renner stole Jason Bourne from Matt Damon...now Matt Damon steals HAWKEYE from Jeremy Renner.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaFucking War Z up in this shit, still gonna watch it though hahaha.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaSit back &amp; let the wall-to-wall visuals wash over you..
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitawow this actually looks pretty good. The first trailer didn&#39;t really grab me, but this one looks much better. As for people complaining about whitewashing, remember that Damon isn&#39;t playing a character that was intended for a Chinese actor. He&#39;s simply playing a foreigner so it&#39;s not the same principle
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHelms Deep on steroids. This is either going to be tragically bad or fucking awesome.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaExpecting this for Luhan!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHelm&#39;s Deep: China
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHelm&#39;s Deep with bad writing and Matt Damon? Count me in
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita国产 helm&#39;s deep
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita鹿晗，我爱你！😍
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t know Agent Pena had jurisdiction in China.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitalol is it dubbed?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitagod damn mongorians
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLUHAN ALWAYS FOR HIM
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI feel so sick of people keep talking about LuHan is gonna take a part in this movie. After all he  can&#39;t be a real cast except the function of grubbing money from stupid fans.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaSInce when did Mongols become monsters and dragons?! Way to distort history XD
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaWorld War R- reptiles
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaChina vs Zerg......
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitawhy the sound is so low?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitain addition to looking like the DUMBEST movie since Gods of Egypt, this trailer also straight up stole the music from Sicario...
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaThe Brothers Grimm sequel! Yay!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitathe effects are a bit weird, yet I like the colors. Story is OK although I can&#39;t judge properly before I watch it. It might just be like the case of the Warcraft movie, which people said would have an awful story and CGI but it turned out great. We&#39;ll see.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> Am I watching the Power Rangers tralier?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLUHAN!!!!💕💕💕💕
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here for Luhan but the other casts and trailer are great! Look forward to the whole movie 💖✨
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaDid Luhan die? Just like that..?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaBack from Mars and remember that he&#39;s not Jason Born, he is Chinese general. Epic scenario!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitai saw, POWER RANGERS!!!!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaAll I can say is, for Damon to be in this, the money must have been pretty good…
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaThis is obviously is about expanding game of throne look Oberyn is net to matt damon this must be when he traveled the world
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitadid they actually rip off johan johannsons score for sicario or did he compose for this too?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLUHAN!!! 👑👑👑👑👑👑
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just here for luhan but  now I&#39;m more excited
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLooking forward to 鹿晗 Luhan&#39;s Hollywood debut!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaFebruary garbage .... did Matt Damon own a favor to someone?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaOmg! Luhan😱😍😍
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaBetter title would be &quot;Audio Dub The Movie&quot;...
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m waiting for the Donald Trump parody trailer.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita2016, when being a white male makes you worse than Satan.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaMusic:<br>Sicario - The Beast (chinese version) :D
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c&amp;t=01m15s">01:15</a> Green Arrow would be proud
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t kill Luhan assholes
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie just to cash in on China&#39;s interest for Hollywood... Remember The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emperor? <br><br>Pathetic. Cringe
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible, some of the dialogue sounds corny and forced af and the CGI looks really bad.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaSo this is Agent Pena&#39;s punishment for working with the Cartel/Los Pepes....poor guy.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaFucking insulting stupid shit here.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaWhy does the english dialogue by the non-Chinese actors look and sound like its been poorly dubbed?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaIs this set in the future? Why is a 21st Century American in China?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaGods of China... Ughh
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaThis is basically a mega zerg rush
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitathis looks fuckin wack
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita&quot; I bet this movie is gonna be huge &quot; - Donald Trump
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avF6GHyyk5c&amp;t=0m25s">0:25</a> ancient time power rangers?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking forward to luhan and the trailer is great👍
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaThe Trailer is just not well edited, they have hollywood people working to promote the thing right? Why is it that the promotional efforts of the film look so unprofessional, posters/trailers included?
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaFor the highest budgeted movie in the history of Chinese production, and Chinese/west coproductions, the special effects looks surprisingly weak and unpolished...
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaLUHAN!! what an overall amazing cast, looking forward to this so much!
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHolly shit, looks good
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaplease tell me this is part of the Godzilla King Kong Pacific Rim cinematic universe.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaHorrible. they shouldn&#39;t have nixed Edward Zwick&#39;s script starring Henry Cavill and Zhang ZiYi with Mongolians as the villain.
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitaUSA - aftermath of the elections - Official Trailer
avF6GHyyk5cdelimeterByIshitais nice to see a film about EEUU wall and mexico people  .

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaat 2:16, who or what is that thing in front of her? a space jockey maybe?
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@webstermuhammad Oh come on. Tarantino&#39;s films are linked by cigarette brands. This is linked to Alien from the ship and the Space Jockey. 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaLikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelikelike
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaC mon Scott, you can do it!!!!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@ Scullibundo how can you like this so much? It looks every sci-fiction movie released in the past few years. Who keeps giving all these films the same look?
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaI CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS EFFING MOVIE

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita1:38-someone(space jockey;;;;)is preparing to launch something.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think this boner will ever go down
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaFuck y&#39;all who said this trailer gave away too much an showed all the good bits, ur just naive retards who think they already know the whole story, U DON&#39;T KNOW SHIT!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitahot shit
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThey get a call from a race of aliens that created mankind, then in finding the &quot;who is god&quot; answer end up stealing something FROM the aliens (i.e. prometheus) where in the &quot;gods&quot; activate &quot;something&quot; to track them down and destroy all of the humans (which is why it shows earth). Eventually creating the bipedal aliens from aliens 1-4, the &quot;kill all life&quot; device the spaceship aliens let loose, took part of our DNA, which gives it the best way to exterminate mankind. 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaNow that was a good trailer
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@TheCStewEffect It&#39;s not. It just exists in the same universe as Alien, so some things (like Space Jockeys) might appear. It&#39;s just like how all of Quentin Tarantino&#39;a movies are in the same universe and are linked together in one way or another.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!!  But they gave away the entire plot summary.  Too much revealed.  The first trailer was much better because of it&#39;s ambiguity.  
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@MrSatrdayKnight - thanks for being so helpful :) 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaOh my fucking god, most intense trailer I have ever seen.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitai have tears on my eyes
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else analyse all the good bits of the trailer after watching it the first time?? No? Just me then lol
Oh and And a CLEAR xenomorph at 1:37!!!
OH HELL YEAH!! This is the film us alien fans have been waiting for!!!! This just peaked my interest even more!! Ahhh I hate u ridley for making me wait a few more months (not really lol)
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaPQP Fantástico! 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaSo bored of this Michael Fassbender guy. Still watch it for Idris and Charlize.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@hamstathps Yes he plays a droid!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaat 2:16 - goosebumps..could it be the early version of the Xenomorph??
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaif this damn thing somehow manages to suck and/or blow, I swear I&#39;ll stop expecting ANYTHING from ANY film EVER.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita2:04

go in slo mo
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaxenomorph alien being removed from host at 2:04 ?
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaholy fucking shit holy fucking shit holy fucking shit

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaDATSHITCRAY
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaNot watching this trailer or any others so the movie ends up that much better. I&#39;m hyped enough as is.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaamazing trailer...bring it on 

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaMOVIE OF THE FUCKING YEAR ALREADY! 

FUCK :D :D :D
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaOH MY GOD... June 8th, please hurry the F up.

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaAvatar = 0   Prometheus= 1
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaUnfortunately, dat trailer shows too much. This aliens ship, which was going to the earth, crashed at the end. I don&#39;t like seeing primary episode at trailers..
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaI really hope holograms are made illegal before we have to endure them floating over every piece of electronics in the future.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaspace jockey has a role in this movie.and i think is the bad guy.

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Big things have small beginnings&quot; Yeah yeah, I try to tell women that all the time!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita2:03 that jumping alien has astronot clothes
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaNice.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThis has Alien written all over it.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita1:37- xenomorph.... :D

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitalooks like some sort of chestburster-ish thing @ 2:05. 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaHammer!

Ridley ist der beste!!!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaHoly crap!!!!!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita1:37 makes me happy!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaOMG?!!!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita4 Space Jockey dislike this trailer!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaEverything is so over saturated in the future!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThis is Jizz in my eyes.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitadislikes??...oh go  f**k yourself..and check your f**king pulse whilst your at it...

EPIC...Ridley Scott..i bow before you....
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaAmazing. True fear. And I think religion has a big part. It is evolution and what would it take for you not to believe in god. Awesome. 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaawesome trailer i waiting to see movies.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@Andreazor Just knowing what exists does not fill in the gaps of the story.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaI was hoping Idris Elba wouldn&#39;t have an American accent. I think his normal accent is pretty cool.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaTHE TITS!



HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@HeavyMetalEvilien Your loss. :P
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m simply speechless. 
Well...let&#39;s hope, that this little trailer will be the beginning of a great movie.
If not...a cinematic world would collapse. For me. 
(Yeah, i&#39;m ignoring Part 4 and all those crappy AvP-Sequels. ;) )
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitai bet michael fassbender&#39;s character is  a robot
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaHai guize - there is an ALIEN at 1.37 :D
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaRidley Scott, though many will immediately bow down to whatever you create...  Seems to me like this is just an extension of Alien...  Not anything as original as I expected.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThanks to this trailer, I&#39;ve seen all the important bits of the movie and I no longer need to go see it.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaSorry but this looks horrible. I will be skipping this crap.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThumbs up if you were rocking to this in 1979 (Alien)!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this video only counting my views?
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaOK I DONT KNOW IF IM CRAZY BUT @1:38 it looks like a queen on the wall 
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaShit! That was AWESOME! But now another 3 more months. :(
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThat trailer is FUCKING SWEET!!!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@disneyboy3d I was just gonna post that how cool ! A xenomorph carving!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaGigers Pyramid wow
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita@jackfwoodward Time doesn&#39;t speed up if you&#39;re frozen...
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaOMG YEEEEEES

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaSo fucking cool!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita1:36... ALIEN confirmed, maybe some type of art but thats an alien for sure!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaFucking Great !!!!

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Big things have small beginnings&quot;

That&#39;s what she said. &lt;(^.^ &lt;)

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaTHUMBS FREAKING UP IF YOUR EXTREMELY EXCITED FOR PROMETHEUS!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitai think ive just died and gone to heaven.

HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaWoot.
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaThe Q&amp;A was amazing thank you! This will be the best movie possibly ever made.... Evolution.... Epic......
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitaFirst! This looks fucking A!
HHcHYisZFLUdelimeterByIshitagotta have the first comment.... CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitajennifer lawrence on a table? They&#39;re really trying to get us in the cinemas... well it&#39;s working!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaGravity with romance and characters?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaRomantic Comedy + Dramedy + Sci-fi with a little bit of cheesy dialogue. &quot;Just what I always wanted&quot;... said no one!!! There&#39;s a reason we haven&#39;t seen much about this movie until now. The studio knows it&#39;s terrible and the actors are embarrassed 😳😳😳😳😳
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaPandorum + Sunshine + Gravity = This
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaOml seriously ahhh
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThis is pretty much Red Dwarf, Lister &amp; kochanski.... kryten as the butler..... the skutters as the robot handing the letter and nodding up and down (almost exactly the same scene in Red Dwarf). I wouldn;t be surprised if this film features a cat (or other mutated animal over the years of stasis)
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaSo like Pandorum but a lot whiter....
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI hope they remove the &quot;You die, I die&quot; dialogue from the final cut.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M SO EXCITED TO SEE JENNIFER IN THE BIG SCREEN AGAIN OMGGGGGGGG!!! THIS TRAILER IS SO EPIC THAT I&#39;M GOING TO EXPLODE
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitait was worth waiting for so long 😍😍😍
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitalo ame lo ame lo ame lo ame
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitasong name?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThat glorious tan on Chris Pratt..i LOVE HIM.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWas NOT expecting this trailer to drop today. Wasn&#39;t expecting the thriller aspect either.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaTAKE ALL MY FUCKING MONEY
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI wish they had chosen another actress instead of Lawrence.  ugh
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaStarlord and Katniss
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie has a tragic ending it will be unforgettable. Just don&#39;t end everything with a stupid happy ending!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaDirector of &quot;Imitation Game&quot;, Composer of Shawshank Redemption, Chris Pratt, and Jennifer Lawrence? i have the feeling this is gonna make a shitload of money.... and will probably be pretty good.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshita&quot;a year ago, everything changed.... WHEN THE FIRE NATIONS ATTACKED&quot;
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaGuardians of the Hunger Games: Breaking Dawn: Sunshine
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI have a feeling the twist in this movie is going to be so fucking good
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI like both actors but this looks corny. I hate to say it but I think this movie is going to flop
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitait doesen&#39;t seen like is competition to Arrival, but still looks like a entertaining movie.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaITs and Adam and Eve thing with the time destination longer than what they were told and even in cryogenesis they still grow older. They need to procreate in order to have children to reach its destination.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaPlease don&#39;t suck...  Please don&#39;t suck...  Please don&#39;t suck...
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a commercial.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m shook
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be so awesome!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaTHIs looks really good !!!! JENNNN
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThe font of the movie is so cool. Do u know if it&#39;s available somewhere?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaFor fucks sake, this trailer gave so much away! People are gonna go see a sci fi romance film with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, so why do they have to reveal so much of the plot? Sony Pictures hang your head in shame
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWall-e anyone?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIt caught my intrigued at the end of the trailer with the &quot;There&#39;s a reason we woke up early&quot;. Now I wanna know.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaProbably the best trailer that does everything wrong
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks better than I thought, eh why not, something to bring your girlfriend to this Christmas, right guys?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaHas that Stargate Universe and 2001 A Space Odyssey vibe to it.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaStill intrigued by it but i reckon it&#39;s one of them films that will end up with 61 % rotten tomatoes rating lol
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaFirst &quot;The Space Between Us&quot; now this. Hollywood is ruining the Sci-Fi genre.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitawow the trailer reveals everything, no need to see the movie :)
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThis is great! It&#39;s going to be an amazing experience to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence on the same screen. This film looks fantastic and looks like it could be one of the best films of 2016! I think there could be a twist in this film. Can&#39;t wait to see it.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI cant stop watching this trailer my replay button is broken!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI live to see two of my favorite actors in a SciFi film! Get me my tickets! Take all my money!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitastar lord and mystique :p
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshita100% flop!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJen looks so good in this movie. Cant wait to watch it
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThis is the type of movies I love to watch!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaAnd of course you have to spoil the plot AND the twist. 🙄
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJenn 😍😍😍
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJenn 😍😍😍
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaAMAZING
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitai really hope they didnt spoil the movie with this trailer
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI love It!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe it took so long to get this trailer but was it worth the wait! Looks great and I can&#39;t wait to see this.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaLooks hysterical. Hopefully they meant it that way.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaGetting serious Space Odyssey vibes from this trailer.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaHow would a date in zero gravity work exactly?<br>How would sex in zero gravity work if it works at all?
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJUST LOOK AT JEN 😍💘💘
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaOMG THIS IS SO PERFECT 😍 I&#39;M SO EXITED
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaStar lord knows his way around universe nothing is gonna get him dont worry
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m So Hyped People <br>The Trailer Gave Me Goosebumps BTW
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks borring to me...
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S FINALLY HERE AND IT LOOKS FREAKING PHENOMENAL!!! I LITERALLY CAN&#39;T DEAL RIGHT NOW!!! 😱😱😱😝😝😝
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIm getting strong Gravity vibes. Not sure if that&#39;s a good or bad thing
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer was strange yet makes me really want to see the movie. I like Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt so I cannot wait!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitabut the line &quot; if you die , i die &quot; a bit cheesy....
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI love Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, but the track records of the director (The Imitation Game) and the writer (The Darkest Hour, Prometheus) don&#39;t inspire a lot of confidence. Hopefully they&#39;ve upped their game for this one!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIm getting old man periwinkle vibes from this trailer and this movie looks great again another movie that is proof that sony is having a great year. Dam it is so intense looks like a movie I have to watch.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJennifer lawrence i love it....  😻
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaAlready love this movie. It brings out that Stargate Universe vibe to it.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIt seems...  okay.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThanks SONY !! I now know the entire MOVIE!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaChris Pratt. Now give me likes.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the whole movie,thx

7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaYou die I die!!!  OMG!!! I&#39;m gonna see it for sure. The great movie this year lOl
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWait... is the plot that the ship is hurtling toward a sun and they have to stop it and you show them passing a sun... did you show the ending in this trailer!?!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWOW, mind blown. This is amazing. It&#39;s going to be one of the best movies of the year and could get nominated for Best Picture ;)
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThe Heartthrob and the Sweetheart
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaOMG looks amazing! Love these two. Plus, the story looks very appealing to me 👌
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaLove Jen, but this looks awful.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaTwo very engaging leads...
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshita😭
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s looking awesome
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaanother Adam and Eve, but wait, it&#39;s better. Oh and in space.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s ok, I guess
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThe promo tour for this though...
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaomgggggggg this is a beautiful trailer. Jen and Chris are so perfect &lt;3
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good! From the trailers, C. Pratt and  J. Lawrence chemistry seems really on point.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Lawrence + Chris Pratt = I&#39;m watching. (plus the trailer looks pretty good too.)
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaThat score, though.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitai like it.
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaLOOKS FANTASTIC
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWTFFF
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWill watch only for the most beautiful person on earth. Chris Pratt &lt;3
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaNice!
7BWWWQzTpNUdelimeterByIshitaWas getting worried about this since there&#39;s literally no marketing until now, but I dig this trailer. Looks great.

5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one with the take-away from this trailer that <i>the black women working in NASA during the space race were the catalyst that made us successful</i>?<br>I&#39;m not knocking their accomplishments (especially for back then) or their contribution, but come on...this trailer has only recently been released and I have already seen people commenting that black people <i>not only built the USA,</i> but <i>got us into space and to the moon.</i>
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWE
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaTwo things America never mentioned. Three African-Americans contributions to NASA and the 1,600 Nazi scientist who became American citizens and designed all of NASA&#39;s rockets, computers etc....(many of them were Class A war criminals). The boss of NASA, former SS officer Wernher von Braun.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! So Proud!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis,and fences seeing both
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaIs that you, Sheldon?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitahighly expecting!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaTheoretical physicist doing a rocket scientist job? What a insult to Sheldon Cooper.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWe wuz rocket scientists an sheitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wfrDhgUMGI&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> When did Sheldon get a job working for NASA?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWe wuz NASA &#39;n shieeeeeeet
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaOmg!!! This is crazy NASA propaganda. Wow lmfao!!!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s the whole story right there.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitais this really a true story or lies??
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaAlways go back in time to make black movies thanks Bollywood for more blacks picking up black lives matter signs good job.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaAh so this is where Cookie was when she was &quot;locked up&quot;.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI wonder if this movie will even acknowledge Margaret H. Hamilton.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaoh look Sheldon
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR THIS!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWOW why watch the movie when the trailer shows the whole thing
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaHAPPY HOLIDAYS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS 2016 FROM YOUTUBE AND FOX
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThe moon landing was fake.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is come out on my birthday!?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be excellent.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaOne of the very few mainstream movies in the last decade that I feel I NEED to see in theaters. This looks amazing.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWhere are all the Sheldon Cooper jokes?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaChad Radwell!!! He&#39;s only in this movie to find Denise Hempfield ;)
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI sadly dont have enough money for tickets or a tv ;-;
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitalol i keep playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wfrDhgUMGI&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> over and over
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks like a quick buck. It seems funny but also predictable. Hopefully it inspires more woman to get involve in science and math. No need to think you need to be the next Kim k or  another hair dresser in order to make money .
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaYaaas!!! Where do I preorder my tickets!??!!?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI smell an agenda...
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaKatherine Johnson is quite accomplished with a very interesting story. Why are they just now getting around to telling her story and of the work done by Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitawow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaall these racist movies.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be great I can&#39;t wait to see it

5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI actually really want to see this, this looks so amazing, and the jokes are hilarious, dry, and subtle I love it
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaA movie focused entirely on race. Here&#39;s a drinking game, take a shot every time they mention somebody&#39;s skin color. I know that I wont be seeing this movie.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome, can&#39;t wait to see it!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThere are literally tears in my eyes at how beautiful this movie is going to be. Thank you so much.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitashow this to black lives matter and maybe they would learn to contribute to society
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitawe need to show this to all the violent protestors to show that you don&#39;t get any where being violent
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wfrDhgUMGI&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a> thats sheldon cooper...aka the guy who plays him but still
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a good movie...wait was that Sheldon from the The Big Bang Theory at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wfrDhgUMGI&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a>
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaStill the Russians were the first
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaScience cares not one iota about skin color!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWait, wait, wait! I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks movies intended for showing the socially disadvantaged overcome is getting as crowded as FPS games.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing! So much hope for this to be a hit.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaJanelle Monae - Ms. Electric Lady herself! I see you &amp; see it for you boo. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Respeck">#Respeck</a>
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshita:O
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitawhy are white people salty in the comments though??
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaway to rip off another movie
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaEmpire went back in time?
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer alone made me emotional and it didn&#39;t even reveal too much! Love Taraji. And music by Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams! ahhhhh
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThe comment about chasing a police officer in 1961 ruins the movie.  Yeah, like her character actually said that.  We&#39;re all aware of the history.  They should just tell the story without blatantly throwing cheap lines like that in your face.  Presenting everything as it actually was would be far more impactful.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaWE
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaThat could happen…
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaAnother movie where black women into white men propaganda!
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaI only watch half of every trailer now... Otherwise you&#39;ll see the whole movie...I get a good feel of the movie and I wait.
5wfrDhgUMGIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait til this come out!

F4gJsKZvqE4delimeterByIshitaNo other actor will bring the justice to the character of &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, The character is made for Matt Damon.  He suits the role best! No Doubt About That!
F4gJsKZvqE4delimeterByIshitaThose badass punch sounds though...
F4gJsKZvqE4delimeterByIshitaThis looks interesting I must say... I hope it&#39;s not the same story tho... I hope it&#39;s a new twist on this story

F4gJsKZvqE4delimeterByIshita1st...
F4gJsKZvqE4delimeterByIshitaoh man I can&#39;t wait
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaDev Patel has a monopoly on all the Indian roles in Hollywood
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaWho scrolled down to look for Slumdog Millionaire comments?
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaHe looks like Sayid from Lost in this trailer :D
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaAnwar wheres Maxxie?
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSlumdog Adopted
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaWhy the heck it&#39;s titled as lion <br>It&#39;s nowhere related to it
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSlum dog millionaire 2
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaWow, actually looks good.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaBeautiful
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitawunderbar!
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaLion? What is this movie about?
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitatrailer looks great, but i imagine why India is always depicted as slum in almost all the hollywood movies, there is more to the country than only slums and poverty
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitadev patel is on fire..keep going..
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaHaha good luck finding your family among billions of indians
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitahe just nailed it . well done
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaOh look third world poverty porn
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaCan we leave out the economic condition of india for a minute and just appreciate how dev has matured as an actor....seems like a tear jerker cant wait for this one!
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitatheater is about to smell like curry, can&#39;t wait!!
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaI actually really like this trailer... Will definitely watch it!
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaLook what winning 1 million dollars can do
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaStupid movie about a Mexican who got lost as a kid.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSure! India isn&#39;t like this poor, filthy country. But the reason why it caught Hollywood directors&#39; eyes because, on this poor side, there lies something really great! Just think why would they capture the skylines and megacities in India when they&#39;ve got NYC? And the directors want to show this rural site so that they could make a movie which is different from the rest. Although I didn&#39;t like Slumdog Millionaire, but that&#39;s the directors&#39; point of view. But don&#39;t judge any country by seeing a movie. India recently ranked #7 in the richest countries and remember GIFT? or World One? India has it all. Living in India, I myself never had this poor and filthy experience in my life.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitathis looks so original...
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaomg i thought the guy in the trailer was Avan Jogia
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaHe is clearly making a mark with every film!!!!God bless him,this movie has every chance to fetch him an Oscar!!!!!Got me into tears!!!!
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSPOILER: he finds his family.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaAll of his roles are about him being an Indian guy.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSaw the piece 60 minutes AU did about this remarkable story. It has a bitter sweet ending.........
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaIf you watch the trailer without sound, it seems like Slumdog Millionaire 2
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaThis guy always does some type of slum dog esq role.... Imma watch this though
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaLooks like another great film. Always pleased to see Dev Patel in leading roles.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaThis is some inspirational shit right here
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshita&lt;3
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaAt least they didnt whitewash it
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaRooney Mara is a freaking on screen monster
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSo... why is this called Lion, is it the guys&#39;s last name, or a metaphor, or a literal lion...?
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitanot impressed really
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MyNiggaDevPatelDeservesAnOscar">#MyNiggaDevPatelDeservesAnOscar</a>
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshita🔱🐼🔱
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d give it a chance. But would be obvious if the ending is &quot;Oh, this is it, I found home... because of the butterflies! I remember!&quot; Hope that&#39;s not it.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaDev looks cool with the long hair and the beard
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitathe trailer alone got me teary
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaTHAT GAVE ME SOME REAL CHILLS CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaGood so far...hope the film is too
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaSeems good. People stop complaining, Ik this isn&#39;t all of India but this is based off a real story. Now, whether that&#39;s true or not is debatable but this does make for good story telling, I mean isn&#39;t that the point of movie entertainment?
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaDamn this looks GOOD !
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitastupid trailer making me tear up now I have to watch the movie
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitawtf there is no lion in this movie
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitatoo good <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LoveFromPakistan">#LoveFromPakistan</a>

-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaBased on a true story+ famous actors= oscars

-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaThat looks good and sad
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaYes Dev!! cant wait to see it. but i know those kids better get paid a decent amount for this movie.

-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaAnother racist stereotypical low life depiction of India played by the most Non-Indian Indian ever. Grow up Hollywood.
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaThis is based on a true story I saw it on another YouTube channel .like wow this guy lost his family and used google earth to trace his footsteps backwards to his home it&#39;s on this channel called Dave and John and they have have this thing called fact wars the story is on one of them
-RNI9o06vqodelimeterByIshitaOscar...............

xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks really good
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitahals dealed with recce,dewey and malcolm.How hard can this be
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s worth torrenting....but not seeding
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitai love these short movies, i cant believe they are free on the internet
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI can make a better looking movie than this
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshita<b>I love James Franco</b>
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like I have something to watch on Christmas thats actually entertaining.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaeminem
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHey, It&#39;s a young Trevor Phillips!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHillary shill Franco.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHEY IT&#39;S ROSE HATHAWAY
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaMeet the fockers combined with the dictator and the social network?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaAll I see is Walt
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaDid he buy their company or did he buy them a company ???
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI love Bryan Cranston and James Franco but to be honest this movie looks really lame.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitazillion ALWAYS make womens happy...Gold digger movie.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s tea bagging you bro!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitajames franco is a terrible actor.  His little brother would have been better for this part.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one who noticed key from key and peele
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaMovies are getting over the top vulgar ruining movies that would otherwise be funny and entertaining. If this is generational then the upcoming next gen movies will be unbearable.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitamost franco movies are trash, this dude cannot be taken seriously
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitamember this is the end. i member
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaEhh. Already been done before but whatever. They also showed the entire movies that&#39;s also great. Love trailers now.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaAlthough people are leaving negative comments about the movie and James ...I&#39;m so excited to watch it. I mean it has Bryan Cranston in it and that&#39;s already good, and in my eyes I think James is perfect for this film he has that look, the tone of voice, even the smile to match his character. I&#39;m all for it ! (:
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshita:D ...looks good
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaNo need to see the movie... I just saw it watching this trailer
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco, Bryan Cranston enough said
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHahahahahha
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitameet the fockers? no thanks
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaWhy wouldn&#39;t he accept him as a son when he&#39;s rich af? 💁🏼
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaFranco did not age well
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHES TEA BAGGING YOU BRO
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t need to be original looks funny as hell, can&#39;t wait
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitalol.. Did anyone notice the girl mumbling Franco&#39;s dialogue with him at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZ2bs9IboU&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a>.. hahaha! amateur!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitain the end he&#39;s gonna be accepted. there you go. that&#39;s the movie.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitahorrible trailer.jesus christ
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaomg yes I love James 😍😍😍
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitathat actually seems so bad yet I will watch it. why? because I can&#39;t get over James Franco (4 ever Harry osborn)
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie 😂😂😂
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSo in this film who I&#39;m rooting more for? The parents...Laird...the moose?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see it! James Franco is so funny!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaKeegan in da house = Insta Watch
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaNo one is good enough for my precious white daughter.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThese lyrics basically explain the whole movie 🎶🎵Why you gotta be so rude?<br>Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m human too<br>Why you gotta be so rude<br>I&#39;m gonna marry her anyway<br>Marry that girl🎶🎵
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSeth Rogen needs to make an appearance!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely watching this. Definitely.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaAnother typical Hollywood movie these days. I think we have all seen this movie before. Girl falls in love with bad boy and father doesn&#39;t like him and tries to break them up. Real original. In the end, father ends up liking the boy. In reality, what father wouldn&#39;t want her daughter with a zillionaire?  You couldn&#39;t pay me to watch this movie. Typical American Pie humor with typical ending.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco is an awesome and most underrated actor in my books.<br>He does a comedy which is fun and everyone&#39;s like oh god it&#39;s terrible!<br>Watch it and then judge guys jeez
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m glad to see Harambe on James&#39;s shoulder. :)
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaRemember, if you supported Trump they don&#39;t want your money. Don&#39;t watch this movie.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fun
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI wanna c dat
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks very good and hopefully it will brighten up a dark winter day. And at least it&#39;s not a remake or a reboot which is kind of rare in Hollywood comedies at the minute.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHAHAHA Christmas movie of the YEAR ! Oh thank you Jesus... I mean James Franco x&#39;&#39;D
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitathe same&quot;meet the parents&quot; scenario we&#39;ve seen ad nauseum. all the while innovative indie films can&#39;t find backing.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI cannot wait for this two of my favorite actors. So excited 😄
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m watching it.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaway better than the first trailer
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitathis trailer made me actually laugh out loud twice it&#39;s been a while since that has happened if youre not a James Franco fan you obviously won&#39;t like this movie this is just his style cause I see all the hate already
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaLOl He&#39;s teabagging you bro XD lol <br>That aside... Omg he is back!!! &lt;3 James Franco!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSuch an original concept...
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHow is your packing process? Need a hand?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s amazing, Bryan Cranston has been in many more roles where he is NOT a murderous meth-cook than where he is (Just one, after all), yet I&#39;ll never not see him as Heisenberg. Just hearing that voice threatening James Franco...I feel like he should be in fear for his life...
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna get a lot of money if James Franco character switch to Aaron Paul!!!<br>Agree?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitait feels like I have watched the whole movie in 2 minutes
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitamove to Canada already Brian!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaharambe with a gun lmao
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie about trump?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks terrible
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitawill try to see bryan Cranston last film before he move to Canada!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is a lot better than the first one was
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like that British show cuckoo
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaJAMES FRANCO IS PERFECT 😍
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI basically just watched the whole movie with this trailer..
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSo over this infantile humor
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitathat was a good movie, thanks for putting all of it, here on youtube
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaWith this trailer, I don&#39;t even need to see the whole movie.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaLooks funny
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSo classic
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSo anyone else feel like you&#39;ve just watched the entire film?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaThis kind of movie make me glad I don&#39;t work in a movie theater anymore.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHey T-Bagging You Bro Lol.... :P  At <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZ2bs9IboU&amp;t=2m29s">2:29</a>
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaJames Franco should be scared of the one who knocks, let alone messing with his daughter!
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaFeels like a Jim Carrey movie. Where is Jim Carrey?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshita<b>Music at the beginning; Rizzle Kicks - Mama Do the Hump :3 You&#39;re welcome ^_^</b>
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sold.....I wonder what the Unrated Edition will look like?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s a campy of cuckoo series 1??
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m expecting a Breaking Bad freak out so don&#39;t let me down.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitawhats the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOZ2bs9IboU&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a>?
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI said it before I&#39;mma say it again, this movie could be EXTREMELY funny if Aaron Paul was in the James Franco role.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaI love James Franco but you don&#39;t mess with Heisenberg.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshita💜💙💚💛❤
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaFranco bout to get a ricin cigarette
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitadoes franko plays wade wilson??????
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaMeet the fockers 3
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaGuy goes on saying double dicking, titties in front of his mum and here, in India, you get detained with no WiFi for life for even having thought of, a cuss word. 😂
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaTime to meet the love of her life. James Franco &amp; Bryan Cranston star in the new trailer for Why Him? In theaters 12.23.
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitaHoho) Будет охуенно)
xOZ2bs9IboUdelimeterByIshitamusic : eminem - berzerk
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLmao... A YouTube ad that actually made me keep watching AND click the link.... A mircale. .....I think it&#39;s kinda funny. I&#39;d go see it.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaParts of this were filmed at my school
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMotor cros
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaOr you could just learn to say no... And make your kids ride the school bus... Just saying.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaBeen responsible is hard suddenly
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good! I feel it&#39;ll be good seeing a movie about responsible (single?) mothers not being prudes and wanting to have a good time, yet not at the expense of their child. I also feel that the majority of the commenters who hate it are either 1) People who have no children 2) Guys who have children but are horrible fathers and leave their baby mamas to do all the work 3) People who are just against all-women main casting or 4) Those who think moms aren&#39;t allowed to wild out every once and a while.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaAnd women want equal pay. HA! Get back in the kitchen. You can barely cook a proper meal now a days.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaSeems like 95% of you are all such negative beings.  If you don&#39;t care for a fun and funny hour and a half film, then don&#39;t see it.  Geeeeeeeez.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI love that song
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWe don&#39;t know how to raise our kids? Oh then lets have a big lesbian orgy and become degenerates
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaId smash em all
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaJews teach white women how to live: the movie
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaDamn Hollywood, women are not funny, quit trying to shove it down our throats you degenerate fucks.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaIf you look at the CDC concerning child health, you&#39;ll find that mothers are 55% of the perpetrators when it comes to children being sexually abused by their parents. You can find other statistics that show that mothers are more likely to beat, to starve, and to humiliate their child than the father is.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitashut up Meg
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a shame this looks shitty cause they have a great cast
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLilly is going to be in this movie for a small cameo 😄
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaPut this shit on netflix
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThis looks unbelievably stupid.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshita&quot;Hey son i&#39;m going to be banging random dudes and drink alcohol all night, be a good boy and stay in your room, ok? bye sweetie.&quot;<br>Is this what liberals want to make us believe is an adequate role model? DISGUSTING
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m here only for Kristen Bell!
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaIf I didn&#39;t have to buy a movie ticket I would go see that.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaFeeding kids healthy food is so stressful...make bad decisions and drink too much instead!  This is trash.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaDoes Hollywood not know about school buses? Every fucking movie with kids they have to be dropped off.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThe world doesn&#39;t need any more bad moms. <br><br>Bad moms usually raise bad kids, which in turn make bad adults. Bad for society, bad for everyone.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaNo.  Just no.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitamore liberal bullshit
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitasame dumb recycled gross humour.  pass
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitacrap.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaKesha!!
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitathis movie in a nutshell<br><br>&quot;omg i hate having kids and responsibility!&quot;<br>&quot;haha come on girls lets partayyy!&quot;<br><br>the destruction of the west cannot come fast enough.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThis film takes place in an alternative universe where men do not exist.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll watch it faded. Lol
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaPlot twist: she reunites with the kid&#39;s father and is able to correctly divide the work of raising a family.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLOL This looks hilarious, I can totally relate! Go moms!
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaCan we please get a Cinema Sins up in this bitch
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI hate when movies portray mothers as morons who don&#39;t know how to handle their children. .but that&#39;s most movies and tv..that&#39;s why I liked the Cosby show..they didn&#39;t take crap from their children
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitagoing to watch it
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaKristen Wiig should be in this movie!
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaOMG.. yeahhhhh.. I loved .. that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m think.. enough with this perfect mom crap.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI want to like this movie but it is too literal. They do not need to say stuff for us to get the jist.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitadumb
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitathis movie is strictly for females, and thats ok, but i cant imagine any guy would wanna see this.  good luck ladies.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI am speechless. Bad moms: Nor funny, poor scenario, bad directing. And trailers are usually better than movies... <br>Not only I won&#39;t go to see it, I won&#39;t watch it even if Mila and Kristen hand me a brand new dvd with the movie themselves.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI think Mila Kunis gets a smaller face and bigger eyes each time I see her.<br><br>Also the usual modern message of &quot;it&#39;s okay to be mediocre, just fuck it, pretend to be 20 forever&quot;
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaSo Mila had a kid when she was like 19 another at 20 and still was very focused and sucessful at her carreer, but a PTO bake sale is what make her fall apart?
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThe little girl from Southpaw?
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaif i wanted to see bad moms i could just go to Section 8
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaIs this supposed to be a comedy, haven&#39;t laughed once which is a shame cause it&#39;s a good cast.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis doesn&#39;t look old enough to be a mom
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaBad Moms is almost a spiritual sequel to The Sweetest Thing. Plus, Kunis and Bell can do no wrong. I&#39;m in!
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitawaiting for lilly (superwoman) cameo
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLooks great
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaFrom this comments I can see why they made this movie. Basically it&#39;s you&#39;re damned if you you and damn if you don&#39;t. Men and woman judge the fuck out of women especially moms. &quot;You don&#39;t breast feed!? You breast fed too long! You give your kids processed food!? You deny your kids everything! You&#39;re a stay at home mom!? You leave your kids to go to work!? You went out to eat 3 weeks after having a baby!? You need to give get away from the kids once in a while overbearing! &quot; There is no way to be a bad mom or parent if you&#39;re seriously trying because there is no right way written to do it. Most parents are just trying their best and winging it with a few things by their parents example and many more from their own perspective in life. No not great examples but basically is a fuck it movie.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWhen it said &quot;from the makers of hangover&quot; i just knew what kinda movies its gonna be.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMy boyfriend does half the work and I do half the work. Together we are a great team and our kids are happy, even though we&#39;re not perfect. It&#39;s not rocket science.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitajohn cena cameo is missing. seems like he is in all movies of this genre
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaY&#39;all are acting like some paid movie critics lol either watch it or don&#39;t
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaAwful
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitacame here for superwoman
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaSoooo Stupid they need to stop making trash movies like these I agree on the kid subject but this is fail
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaway to go for perpetuating female irresponsibility! this is what&#39;s wrong with society today. weeee let&#39;s celebrate single motherhood... smh
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaintroducing the new shit hole that american society has sunk to.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThis does not look good at all. Plus, how does Jada Pinkett with her over 25 year career not have a speaking role in a trailer??
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThis sounds like horse shit.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaum...I guess it&#39;s OK...nothing against the actresses and it looks amusing... but who is ready for some suicide squad huh!!!??
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLooks like complete and utter garbage.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaStressed out milfs finally let their freak flag fly by chugging alcohol and whipped cream. I don&#39;t need to go out and pay money to see a movie like this.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it seem like these women were randomly thrown into motherhood? Like her kids are like 10, she&#39;s had a long time to master this and would not still be so addled by taking care of kids. And where are any of the dads? This shit looks so stupid.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaGuys!! Who is excited for Natural born pranksters
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI feel like you won&#39;t laugh at half the jokes in this unless you are actually a parent. Maybe it&#39;s just me.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWell, at least this looks better than the ghostbusters reboot.....
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitasurprise surprise no mention mentions of teh fathers.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks stupid and all but I agree that kids today are a bunch of soft ass little bitches who are not prepared for how the world actually is. wet rags.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaomg actually looks fucking stupid. don&#39;t try so hard. and don&#39;t dumb us down like those fucking men movies that they lose the baby while shopping and shit. so stupid. there&#39;s so much more to invest their money in than this crap.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThat casting made my dick hard and the movie looks funny so I can&#39;t wait till this one drops
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll bite

iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaSong is &quot;Good Day&quot; ft Nappy Roots
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaAaaannd....Western Civ continues to circle the drain as we &#39;celebrate&#39; the &#39;empowerment&#39; of the single mom&#39;s display of blatant brattishness. <br><br>Theodore Dalrymple had it right when he suggested that the exemplars of such behaviour tended to corrupt the lives of those who could least afford to deal with the consequences.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitawhat is the song in trailer
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWhy do they even make these movies, who write the scripts? even bollywood is making better films now. WTF hollywood?
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMilaaa😍
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaanother reason for people to say women arent funny, who wrote this plot?
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitalooks better than ghostbusters at least.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMila Kunis looking beautiful as always, and this movie looking as shitty as feature film could possibly look.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMore like &quot;Bad Milfs&quot;
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWhat a cliche over done movie. Im surprised Mila Kunis agreed to this. By the way she looks FANTASTIC. Also, the kid that plays her son looks like Gordo from Lizzie McGuire
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaLove how fathers aren&#39;t mentioned or shown anywhere in this film. Another blatant promotion and idolization of the career woman, single-motherhood, and subliminal erosion of the traditional family. Men need not apply.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why exactly, but this looks so BAD. Over-done, cliché and super tired. Maybe is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKCw-kqo3cs&amp;t=00m00s">00:00</a> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKCw-kqo3cs&amp;t=00m06s">00:06</a> unnecessary mini clip at the beginning of the video or the photography, which made me genuinely think it was a TV sitcom
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaIs that Ted Cruz in drag on the left in the still image?
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaMom&#39;s should be mom&#39;s not very wild humans.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaМоралфаги негодуют)
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaBad Moms, Bad Grandpa, Bad Teacher -- BAD MOVIES. Art is dead, burn it all to the ground.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitawait wasn&#39;t this originally the one that was supposed to be called Mean Moms
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaThere is something off with this trailer, hopefully  from just the trailer and not the movie.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaOkay this is the type of movie you release on Mother&#39;s Day.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaFROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER... FUCK THIS SHIT.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaWell then.<br><br>That&#39;s 2 minutes of my life I&#39;ll never get back.
iKCw-kqo3csdelimeterByIshitaCool 👌👌👌👌👌
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaLooks awesome. Casey &gt; Ben.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the beginning song?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaDid someone said manchester united?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaEhhh
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaMATTHEW PERRYMAN JONES
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitahollly shit its a wheallll!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaOnly Manchester i know is Manchester United
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be a tear jerker.<br><br><br><br><br>The song at the end?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI thought the dude in the thumbnail was Ben Affleck
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI wanna see it all NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCried like a goddamn baby watching this.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaSo amazon is making movies now, got to be better than sequel rehashes from Hollywood.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t stand movies like this but I really appreciate his work. I think Casey Affleck is one of the most underrated actor out there!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI ALREADY WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI clicked because I reckon This film was about football. What a disappointment.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCasey as Robin
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaall the brits that clicked..its not OUR Manchester😭
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaLove to see it but...<br>you killed Kyle Chandler?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaaccent is rubbish
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCasey affleck one of the most underrated
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThat is the guy from American pie, Kevin&#39;s brother
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaGot to love the Boston accent.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaSong: Matthew Perryman Jones - Land of the Living
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaboring
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaA trailer made my cry. Kudos Casey and company.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaDamn, Casey Affleck is really looking more and more like Ben Affleck...<br><br>I actually only watched this because I thought It was Ben on the thumbnail.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaBy the title I thought it was going to be a football movie and now I&#39;m sad because it&#39;s not
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaMichelle Williams is going to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DeservesIt">#DeservesIt</a>
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis looks a rough ride to sit through emotionally. I heard it&#39;s great from those who&#39;ve seen the film.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaSo the &quot;kid&quot; is like 20 and needs a guardian?  So confused...
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaMatthew Perryman Jones- Land of the Living
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m definitely seeing this!!! :)
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s with the dislikes? this looks fantastic.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaOscar smells for Casey and Michelle :-) lol
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaLuigi Affleck
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitawow forsen is a really good actor
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThe town Manchester-by-the-sea changed their name from just Manchester so they wouldn&#39;t be confused with the New Hampshire city.  By the sea has a reputation for being very snooty.  Doesn&#39;t quite fit with the blue collar vibe of this trailer.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitathe only dude who kill Jesse james fuking ford
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m all in for Kyle Chandler. It&#39;s only a matter of time before he becomes an A-list actor in movies.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCast Casey as Lincoln March and we&#39;re settled.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI clicked on it coz I thought he is Ben xD
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshita:) This looks better then I thought it would!!!! Excited to see how this is going to be received.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWhy do people want to see movies about inadequate human being screwing up each other&#39;s lives?  Half the men in America are in dire jeopardy of dying from uterine cancer.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the song?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitasong anyone?? thx!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaAnyone know what song is playing during the second half of the trailer?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaomg omg omg omg omg
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaStarring Batmans bro...
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitalooks like &quot;gahbage&quot;
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaManchester isn&#39;t by the sea😂😂
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWhat happened to your brother?<br>He became Batman
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCannot wait for this one.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCasey Affleck is easily one of the most underrated actors of our time<br><br>He deserves so much more recognition.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis is what i&#39;m talking about!! Since i see the title and the crew, i knew it.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaOh my god just be his guardian already and let&#39;s move on with our lives
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI live in Manchester UK. 😣 there is no sea
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis looks really good actually. I&#39;ll see it.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWhere did they shot this movie? this town looks so beautiful
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaboooorrriinngg
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitait sounds ok
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaanother movie by one of the afflecks about baasten isn&#39;t it
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaManny on the map 0161
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI think that casey join to a New batman movie with his brother as nightwing.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaoh that Manchester...Meh.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI was like oooh Ben a<br>Affleck! then I look at the title like oh wait... okay 😂
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting for this movie since it came out in Sundance, I think is going to be amazing
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaAmerica by the sea
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaDo you hear that, good movie season is upon us!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaReally I want to see this......it got really good buzz at Sundance film festival.....and I just can&#39;t wait....
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m waiting... I&#39;m still waiting... I&#39;m always waiting... This is the fate of a movie fan. Constantly waiting for movies to come out.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaDamn, looks good for a 41 year old o.o
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI think it would be better if the &quot;kid&quot; was younger. Looks about old enough to handle himself. Still looks like a good film.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis looks great!
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCasey Affleck is related to Ben Affleck that means that he&#39;s related to batman.....mind blown
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaOnly one Manchester and its red
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaWas expecting a northern tale about Manchester UK, how about no...
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitais this like the american manchester or something?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitawhy all the dislikes? looks solid to me
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsVoD0pTge0&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> It&#39;s naht a shahhhk

gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCasey affleck is relative with Ben Affleck?
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitalook good
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI live in Manchester that&#39;s is definitely not it
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaI love Casey
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsVoD0pTge0&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> is what this movie has been created for. Difference is they&#39;re trying to catch an Oscar
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitalooks good but that was a bad trailer
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be beautiful. So good to see Kara Hayward back on screen since Moonrise Kingdom.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaTrailers tell too much, just show dont tell
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaLooks great. Love the title as well.
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaCan I ask why it&#39;s called Manchester by the sea
gsVoD0pTge0delimeterByIshitaLast time I was this early the wall between mexica and USA wasn&#39;t there yet

-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshitaI find it weird I had to watch an ad to watch an ad.
-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks very intriguing!
-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshitaThis to me looks like if David Fincher directed Pulp Fiction
-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshitaMichael Shannon is low key in everything
-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshita100 percent sure, amy and jake will be nominated for this
-H1Ii1LjyFUdelimeterByIshitaOMG OMG OMG OMG 😭😍❤️ Looks so intense !

79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be good or total failure but I will watch this just to see Lee Jun Ki on the big screen.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaWow! They&#39;re finishing it off with a blast looks amazing!. I love these movies! <br><br>The games died at 4 so calm down all you Felicia&#39;s.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThe best trailer ever! 🙌🏻✨❤️
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaso..... why is Issacs back again with the laser grid for the 20th time? and..... why is Claire always captured in a glass box????
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaResident Evil you either Love it or hate it ;].I love it !.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI really like it !.<br> <br>All Resident Evil movies I like,so this for sure will be not bad as well ;].
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLooking good.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaIt looks pretty bad
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaF u people this is the last movie im going to watch this one lol
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaSharknado is better then this crap, im glad cause this movie , by some reason called Resident Evil is over
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI want Wesker to be the father of my kids.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll see it either way, but tbh, the trailer for Retribution looked better than this one (in my opinion) and I didn&#39;t quite care for that movie. I&#39;m looking forward to watching it though. I&#39;m a fan of both the games and their movies. I respect the differences between them. (I know, crazy right?)
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaFortemente!!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaNo joke, I want Michael Bay to headline the new Resident Evil series.  It&#39;s at its best when it knows it&#39;s cheesy B-film fluff with big boobed babes and massive explosions taking out the zombies.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaMuito amor por esses filmes trashs do resident evill 💛❤
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitai love that Millas very own daughter is now playing the Red Queen!!!!!:)
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s Jill Valentine?<br>Sienna i love you.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitakaraio eo dia mais feliz da minha vida.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThe Red Queen is the good guy now? Wtf happened in the last film where she was the one who wanted to kill mankind? And Wesker being bad again?! Wow what a cringy plot.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThis is the trailer I&#39;ve been waiting all these years, the other one was amazing, but this is pure PERFECTION ! &lt;3 .
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaTHAT REMIX OF THE SONG IS JUST SO AWESOME LIKE I NEED IT RIGHT NOW
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaalgum br ae?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaMilla jovovich 😍😍😍 i love her
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaFUCKING AWESOME
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaPlease let Issacs turn out to actually be BIRKIN....  That would be awesome.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaGood as soon as this ends I give it aboot 5 or 6 years before Capcom decides to give it a reboot and have it be a proper horror movie and hopefully star like Chris and Jill instead of them taking the back seat (Even tho they should just either leave it alone or make a HBO/Stars/Netflix TV Series outta it RE has A LOT of lore)
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaFast and Furious 8 ???
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaComes./././

79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaJeeeesus it&#39;s ridiculous how much they fucked with resident evils universe.....honestly....kinda makes me sick to my stomach.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaYeah, Iain Glen! ❤️
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI dream of a day when they make REAL Resident Evil movies.

79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaDo the gamer fanboys honestly think anyone cares what they think? These are the same idiots that constantly rebuy the same couple games and think bad controls, poorly placed camera angles and excess backtracking are good game design. Not even the game company listens to these pathetic whiners.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a cringy way to spoil a nice Guns n Roses song.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaWho wants to bet that this wont be the last movie?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaSO MORMONT FOUND THE CURE ? SWEET &lt;3
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaAI MEU DEUS
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaWeak.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitawhat is Jorah, The Andal doing in this movie???????????!!!!!!!!!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaDigan lo que quieran pero esta película tiene una pintaza increíble! Amo estas películas de resident evil!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaNEED TRACK!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI saw 3 RE game bosses on this trailer.......alright i liked
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLooks so bad, i love it
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaAlice and Wesker fighting at the lasers corridor.....guess how wesker gonna die?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaCHIEF STILINSKI WHAT ARE YOU DOING
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s the best trailers of Resident Evil Saga. Milla Jovovich, you are the best also Paul W.S Anderson
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaResident Evil: The Final Chapter ( Part 1..2..3..4... )
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThese movies are just so f%&amp;king terrible. Now add a dubstep remix of Paradise City on top of it. These movies don&#39;t deserve the Resident Evil name attached to them.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLixo.<br>Ainda bem que é o último filme que levará o nome Resident Evil.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThank god, the final chapter! My cancer is cured
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitamaravilhoso
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitalooks great!  i LOVED the first 4 films but RETRIBUTION was just atrocious. this final film has me so excited to see it!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI thought it said John Malkovich..
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI need to know who made the remix of &quot;Paradise City&quot; used in this NOW!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaOMG! This is f*cking crazy!!!! I cannot wait more!!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaBring on the reboot!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshita:O increíble, espero con ansias el disfrutar esta ultima película &lt;3<br> PD: dejen de estar chingando que: &quot; si la franquicia fue un desastre&quot;, &quot;que no tiene nada que ver con los vídeo juegos&quot; , &quot; que donde esta Jill, Ada, Leon, etc&quot; ya basta! yo soy super fan tanto del vídeo juego como de las películas &lt;3. Yo no veo nada de malo que sean historia alternativas ni tampoco que se enfoquen en Alice, son cosas que las grandes empresas del cine hacen para explotar increíbles títulos como lo es &quot;resident evil&quot;. No me digan que incluso la &quot;supuesta historia de los video juegos&quot; ha evolucionado y ha dejado muy por de lado el horror survival.. así es esto! así que maduren y valoren el esfuerzo de todos los que realizan estas películas. y YA!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaSay what you fucking will, any film with a TRIPLE barreled shotgun has got my ticket.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLol the first movie at least TRIED to be scary...They just pretty much gave up and became straight action/adventure.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitawhat I understand on this trailer: Nothing<br><br>how she killed that GIANG FLYING MONSTER with a car? A CAR?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie needs HDR badly
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t remember much before all this started either. How many Resident Evil movies are there now?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s bittersweet that the franchise is ending! <b>I love the Resident Evil movies.</b> They&#39;re great popcorn flicks. Milla Jovovich is just badass! She needs to be in a Marvel/DC film!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Sd4GtOXuI&amp;t=2m43s">2:43</a> Lion amd chris 😨
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaand the final<br>and the final<br>and the final
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaand the final<br>and the final<br>and the final
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThey may have next to nothing to do with the games but they are entertaining, in really dumb way.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaoh my god! WOW!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitame vi toda la saga ahora esperando el final.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ittttttttttttttttttttt &lt;3
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like an entertaining mess.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLet this be the last movie.
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaSony can you just reboot this fucking franchise already!! Just call Biohazard and make it a true horror survival movie based in the mansion.  Is that so hard to do?
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaUGGGHH I LOVE RESIDENT EVIL SO MUCHHH!! Both the movies and games are great!!! Can&#39;t wait!!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m feeling BAD. I&#39;M IN LOVE WITH ALL THIS OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaLmao they literally explain the raccoon city incident like the people who will see this movie dont already know about it
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;My name is Alice,i&#39;m not connected to resident evil&#39;&#39;
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI am not fucking ready to say goodbye to Alice. That lasers scenes kills me! She is dogding like Captain One in the first movie!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaQUE FODA
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaThree more months... (I&#39;m dancing) Three more months...
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaВот это да, супер! Жду с нетерпением!!!

79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaOMGGGGGGGG
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaI LOVE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES SINCE 2002!!!
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH QUE LINDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
79Sd4GtOXuIdelimeterByIshitaAwesomeee!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait...CAN&#39;T WAIT!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Contact 2. 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshita&quot;we must not think as individuals but as a species&quot;..... to a certain extent. Individualism is what makes us. Collectivism has lead to the true horrors this world has produced.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaReminds me Robert Zemeckis &quot;Contact&quot; with Jodie Foster.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaSome probably thought after &quot;Rises&quot;, Nolan is going to move to smaller films. But there is no doubt in my mind Nolan is the one to shy away from big, audacious blockbusters like this one is going to be. Space + McConnaughey + Nolan = GREATNESS!!! I&#39;M IN!!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaSame scenery from Man of Steel? lol
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be epic!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaNot really a trailer for Interstellar, more like a trailer for the first 10 minutes of Interstellar
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshita♫♫ I could stay awake just to hear you breathing<br>Watch you smile while you are sleeping<br>While you&#39;re far away and dreaming<br>I could spend my life in this sweet surrender<br>hahahaha!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie turns into The Dig...
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaCan I book my tickets yet??????!! :-O
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaI saw this on IMAX today for the previews while waiting for GODZILLA!!!!! LOve it! 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaSeems almost like Nolan&#39;s taking a cinematic response to the scientist&#39;s laments about the value of science in the face of climate change, finite resources, asteroid impact, etc.<br><br>A rallying cry against the cynics, priests, mullahs and doubt-merchants for solidarity and long-term thinking; to wake up to how vulnerable, precious and fleeting humanity&#39;s future is. Science or the abyss, dear ones. To return to the dust and the water we emerged from... or out into the light, to be among the stars.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaWhat if John Steinbeck and Stanley Kubrick had made a science fiction film? This is what it would look like.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaSimply Stunning. Cant wait for this!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaI want a new Sunshine not a whining drama!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaYou don&#39;t wait until the planet is in a global drought and dying before you explore deep space.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaMy most anticipated film of the year!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like one of the greatest films ever made; i teared up just watching the trailer. I think Christopher Nolan found his masterpiece
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like it&#39;s gonna be up there with Gravity, can&#39;t wait!!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer.. But who did the final mix for the trailer?? I can&#39;t hear any dialogue towards the end of the trailer.. :-/
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitawoah.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m holding out for a Jodie Foster cameo, y&#39;all.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaMcConaughey has become a badass actor lately!! Looking forward to this movie
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAnybody else wondering why it read &quot;It was never meant to die here&quot;? and not &quot;we were never meant to die here&quot;? Is the &quot;it&quot; referring to humans?
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaEyegasm..!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitanot impressed. But that&#39;s good, i&#39;ll wait til november to see it
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaFix the volume maybe? It&#39;s peaking several times towards the end...
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAHHHH SO MUCH HYPE! NOLANSTAR NOLANSTAR NOLANSTAR!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitalove it
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaHans Zimmer&#39;s background score is always amazing. 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOnly 9000 views ? In my opinion, we should expect 90000000000000000000 views for this. <br>
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIs this a science fiction or a drama??
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIm in tears
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaooo em G! <br>i can&#39;t wait
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThat was freakin beautiful...a tear almost fell. Nolan is THE MAN! and Matthew McConaughey is STELLAR!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaYawnnnnnnnnnnn
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing. Can&#39;t wait!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaNolaaaaaaaaaaaaan
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOh sweet Jesus Jet-Skiing Christ, Nolan&#39;s &quot;Interstellar,&quot; looks PHENOMENAL. I just hope that he doesn&#39;t end it off with McConaughey&#39;s character going into a wormhole and having it  end there.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitanice
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIts true we need no more engineers :). and I&#39;m an engineer.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! CHRISTOPHER NOLAN IS A GOD!!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitathis looks amazing.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshita&quot;The world doesn&#39;t need anymore engineers&quot;<br>BRAVO NOLAN, BRAVO
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitakain91939   I really don&#39;t see this outgrossing Avatar at the box office. Already the dialogue sounds weak and Hollywood fake serious like in The Dark Knight Rises and Man Of Steel. How TH are we supposed to root for anyone in this scenario.<br>Look at their goal. Use up one planet then move on to the next. Don&#39;t use ANY science to restore Earth just spread like a disease to another world?<br>Nope! This film will be another Nolan Inception/Prestige, Convoluted, needlessly overcomplicated, dull, empty and lifeless and ultimately meaningless. <br>All the Nolanite Avatar haters should be ashamed(I&#39;m looking at YOU Mike Stoklasa of RedLetterMedia ).
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit...
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaSo, he&#39;s a pilot AND an engineer? What, was billionaire brain surgeon not available? Talk about your Phantom Menace syndrome.That&#39;s too many things for that character to be, the writers should just pick ONE.Not only that,but McConaughey doesn&#39;t come across as EITHER of them.<br>Why not just name him Garry Stu and be done with it already? How TH does Nolan plan to make this character relatable to anyone in the audience?   
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaMan I&#39;ve gotta see this
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps. I have goosebumps now.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaTHIS is what all of you Avatar haters like?! Call this a sci-fi? Unbelievable! <br>Interstellar will not make a billion dollars. Watch this space. If it beats Avatar box office gross, I&#39;ll admit Nolan is God the Nolanites always claim. Till then...
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOkay, yes. This looks fucking amazing.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitadat Event Horizon ... <br><br>This looks incredible!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaboring music
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaWhat is name of the music?
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaamazing trailer! In Nolan we Trust
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitagood trailer, doesn&#39;t give much away but still leaves me hyped for the film! can&#39;t wait. inNolanWeTrust
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOK I&#39;m guessing that they discovered the black hole near solar system, and went through event horizon to boost the speed of craft... 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaДа, сучки, раз в два года в этот мир снисходит благодать!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing trailer.. Wondering about those 2 nerds who hit dislike.. Did they even get it?
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for it !!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThe music used in this is from V for Vendetta. If you want to see it in a movie theater, the Imax 3D version of Godzilla is your best bet as scenes from this movie were shot in Imax and 35mm. 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThis just gave me goosebumps :D Eagerly waiting for this movie! :D
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIn Nolan We Trust.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaperfect, epic.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaRust cohle is back yes
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaBets thing about wormholes, I get older. and they stay the same age. Alright alriiight.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaCHRIS NOLAN IS THE BEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOH YES!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshita FUCK, I&#39;m gonna cry. 
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaGoosebumps.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitathe little girl looks just like anne hathaway
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaI wanna sleep till November :D
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaQue ganas! 6 meses para el trailer y otros 6 para la película no puedo!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaепічно! чекаємо!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaLooks deep, excited for it.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIn Nolan We Trust
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaYes!!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIf this is only half as good as Inception, it will be the movie of the year!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaPeople criticizing McConaughey go watch The True Detective, Dallas and Mud!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who ended up with goosebumps on every part of my body? Nolan you fucking genius!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitacant wait.....
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitafuck yah
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaWormhole time...Cant wait for this one.Nicely cut trailer \m/<br>But strangely the music is &quot;Evey Reborn&quot;-Dario Marianelli from V for vendetta :(
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaNolan takes his work to the next level.<br>Just wow.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaMusic is the same one where you can here it in V for Vendetta movie, Natalie Portman&#39;s scene(God is in the rain).
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaAnother Nolan masterpiece for sure.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThis is what a trailer is supposed to be like. Spoiler Free and Attracting.<br>But I guess that they don&#39;t have a musical score for the movie yet because they are using music from &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. I LOVE IT ANYWAY!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThat much of Producing Companies :D Feeling Excited
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaOh what glorious new horizons will Nolan lead us into with this one.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaGOOD LORD this look SO GOOD! 6 more month, can&#39;t fucking wait!!!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaGr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaTHE KING IS BACK.
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaIn Nolan We Trust | Here is the next 2001: A Space Odissey
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaThankyou so much! I feel like everything from this trailer was in the first hour of the movie, unlike most nowadays which give you the whole plot.<br>Brilliant!
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaMatthew McConaughey is terrible<br>i dont know how he can star in anything
2LqzF5WauAwdelimeterByIshitaWow first like baby!! Can&#39;t wait for this film!! Movie of the year!

4haJD6W136cdelimeterByIshitaNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
4haJD6W136cdelimeterByIshitaAs someone who does not play or really enjoy the games that much, this looks cool. I might see it in theaters, if not then I&#39;ll definately buy the bluray.
4haJD6W136cdelimeterByIshitaNothing is true, everything is permitted.
4haJD6W136cdelimeterByIshitaStill better than RDR 2.

q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaJust saw the Seven Samurai recently, phenomenal movie. Excited for this now!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a big fan of the original so I was skeptical when they said they&#39;d remake it. This looks like a fun western instead of the gritty stuff we&#39;ve been getting lately so I&#39;m all excited for this one.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitahuge fan of these actors especially Ethan Hawke stoked to see him in here
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaAs much as I hate seeing American westerns be rebooted and just filled with a bunch of characters for &quot;diversity&quot;, I must confess that this looks pretty good.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but i hope the movie itself doesnt feature the shitty kanye west music. Sets the wrong tone comepletley<br><br>What is with people and putting modern music in westerns latley? its so fucking out of place
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThis remake should have been seven women not seven men
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaEnough time has passed for a good remake of this. I actually enjoyed the remakes of True Grit, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RBA0xoaWU&amp;t=3m10s">3:10</a> to Yuma, 13 Assassins, etc. Fuqua and Denzel always make for a good duo as well. This looks like a blast.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitalooks like it&#39;s based off of the Hateful Eight or something
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitai was hoping they&#39;d play the clash&#39;s magnificent seven, but it doesn&#39;t seem like that kind of movie )- : what a waste
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s the classic song ? Now it seems that we have to listen to Kanye West crappy songs in every trailer that&#39;s released.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThe hateful eight<br>The magnificent seven<br>The ridiculous six<br>The gritty Five<br>The optimistic Four<br>The notorious Three<br>The joyous Two<br>The Lone Ranger
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaGuardians of the Old West brought to you by MARVEL
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaLovely nurturing breasts.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaUff, a potentially okay trailer completely wasted by the choice of music.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s up with those shitty mini trailers at the start and why do the real ones keep getting longer and longer? Stop that, Studios!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThe song is &quot;Dangerous&quot; by Royal Deluxe feat. rapper, K.O.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/born-for-this-ep/id1088256338">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/born-for-this-ep/id1088256338</a>
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaA Kanye song is a stupid reason to dislike a trailer. Especially when its a Kendrick song
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaOh look! How cute, a remake of Seven Samurai..... Oh wait.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaif u make something perfect then copies will be imperfect end of disccusion and a thumbs down
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks magnificent!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshita:49 them titties
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThe 1954 original movie was Akira Kurosawa&#39;s epic &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot;, which was a superb film, groundbreaking in many ways (the scene in so many Westerns where the Indians come over a hill? Kurosawa!)  It was multifaceted, featuring characters with depth, morality, charisma and martial skill.  Toshiro Mifune, who plays comic relief, is brilliant. Some (many?) of the actors were also Kendo masters, so when you see them engaged in swordplay, it is the real deal.<br><br>The 1960 John Sturges remake was a piece of shallow crap, with a &quot;yee haw!&quot; script, two dimensional characters, and a lack of plot that happens when you take a 3h27m story and try to cram it into 2h8m. I felt genuine loss when characters died in The Seven Samurai, I found The Magnificent 7 to be boring and hackneyed.<br><br>Now they&#39;ve remade the remake, with more fatalities, explosions, and random violence, even less plot and character development, and whoever did that &quot;music&quot; (Kanye, Kendrick, I don&#39;t care, just try something appropriate to the period).  Oh, and when Hailey Bennet says &quot;I want righteousness... but I&#39;ll settle for revenge&quot;?  Yeah, bullshit.  Righteous(ness) is a title bestowed upon you by others, you can&#39;t &quot;ask for it&quot;.  Revenge is what you seek.  The word she SHOULD have used was &quot;justice&quot; (or &quot;retaliation&quot; or &quot;retribution&quot; or &quot;rice crispies&quot;) any of them would have made more sense than &quot;righteousness&quot;.<br><br>Remind me to miss this piece of cinematic garbage.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitayes please..
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThis is strange casting.  Denzel set the right tone, but not sure about the rest.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaNothing can beat the original
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer! Surprisingly Kayne&#39;s song wasn&#39;t a terrible addition to the trailer and actually fit compared to Assassin&#39;s Creed. Still hate Kanye though.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSong/music: House Of The Rising Sun<br>Artist: Heavy Young Heathens
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaUhh...rap music?  Is that really necessary?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaclash- magnificent seven
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitacan we stop putting Kanye west&#39;a garbage music in behind really good movie trailers. it ruins the trailer for everyone
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t help but to be SOOOO excited to watch this! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Mag7">#Mag7</a><br><br>Also:<br>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RBA0xoaWU&amp;t=1m15s">1:15</a>) My favourite Actor!!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSo much talk about whitewashing nowadays, how about blackwashing, yellowashing and redwashing here?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaoriginal was masterpiece!!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaTHE MAGNIFICENT TRAILER
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaProbs be utter wank. Seems to lack the substance of the original. Also, Kanye West, wtf?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaCan I just say that I&#39;m really impressed with this movie? Not because of anything about the movie itself (though it does look great) but because of how cool the internet is being about it? It&#39;s like the anti-Ghostbusters, and in this age where people hate reboots for really no particular reason, that makes me feel extremely happy.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s because people realize that the &quot;original&quot; Magnificent Seven was already a reboot of the Japanese movie Seven Samurai.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaDear God!! Please spare me this politically correct crap.  They&#39;re only missing a lesbian gunslinger in a wheelchair and they&#39;ve got all the boxes ticked.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaAnother remake! Why? But this one is all PC. All kinds of different races in the wild west (not historically accurate at all) and they&#39;re not helping a small Mexican village this time.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaGRAVES!!!!!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWHY KANYE&#39;S SHITTY MUSIC FOR A WESTERN?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSo Ridiculous 6, Magnificent 7, and Hateful 8... noice.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good, luv westerns, great cast...hope it lives up to the trailer. Ohh and Sony, we&#39;re still not OK me and you after the Ghostbusters fiasco.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWhat Kanye West song is that?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaA bollywood movie named &quot;China Gate&quot; had a very similar plot. But i would definitely want to watch this movie!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaChris Pratt
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaMurica Gun GUn!!! Weehheee...
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI am a simple man. I hear Kanye&#39;s music, I dislike.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSomething about modern cinema&#39;s light and color is so ugly to me -- no matter the composition, resolution and budget It only ever looks synthetic and lifeless.<br><br>I miss natural light on celluloid.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaIf it&#39;s even half as good as Ridiculous 6 then it&#39;ll be a timeless classic
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI need this movie like yesterday
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaestou muito ansioso
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitawow... Kanye West music overlaying a multi million dollar production. This movie is going to be terrible.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s Django?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitagreat trailer. Sh1tty rap music accompaniment. There IS better music from better artists out there.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaBasically, A Bug&#39;s Life in live action.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitadislike for kanye!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song name?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaand i Think. ..Hollywood Brings is the Original Sound from mcqueen..Brynner...bronson...coburn...wallach...ok kanye works in  2016 movie...but where is the respect from a legendary movie???? Blown away like smoke...
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitacowboy westerns...we grow up with
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie better not have &quot;FUNNY MARVEL QUIPS&quot; and shitty pop music.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, love western movies, can&#39;t wait and yusssss Chris peats in this,lol
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitai want to watch this movie now...
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaJust why Kanye here? Noooo
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI at least expected Will Smith to show up in Wild Wild West 2, he just isn&#39;t coming back for any of the sequels that made his career.<br><br><br><br><br>... Shame.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good although Im mad that theyre showing a load of material from the 3rd act/final action set piece. The music was really good too.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI really hope this new hip hop rap music shows up in a movie about the old west.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaIf there isn&#39;t the original magnificent seven music in the next trailer I&#39;m not going to watch the movie
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaDenzel motherfukers
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaЧто это за карнавала толерантности?<br>Позорище какое то и паразитизм на имени старого фильма с Юлом Бринером.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaNot a Red Dead Redemption 2 announcement trailer, but at least a western. I liked Star-Lord anyway.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWe really need Kanye West&#39;s shitty music in every 2nd movie trailer?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaGO AHEAD AND SKIN THAT SMOKE WAGON
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI think it will be great movie. But could you make a version of trailer without rap?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSo you seek revenge? I seek righteousness.  But I&#39;ll settle for magnificent.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Rainbow Seven&quot; :D
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaHell yea! Can&#39;t wait!  I loved the remake (ripoff?) with Brenner, McQueen, etc., and this looks great.  I don&#39;t like the hip hop in the trailer, I think that hurt it, just like the rap music in the Star Trek trailer, it does not fit the vibe of a western.  That aside, this looks fantastic.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitameh
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitai love Chris Pratt just as much as the next guy but I can&#39;t really take him seriously
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitadidn&#39;t something like this just come out
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaGooood!!!!!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaAhh yes looks great until you see the pg-13 and I just think expendables 3 in the west which is the vibe they are going for here
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaSomeone plz tell me what that son is in the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RBA0xoaWU&amp;t=1m53s">1:53</a> <br>thx
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaanother great trailer!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s high noon
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWho else couldn&#39;t hold back their grin while watching the trailer??
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaIsn&#39;t me or is that westerns films are getting popular again?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThis is awesome
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song used in the trailer?
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitawhat song is this ....
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaMore shitawful hip hop attached to a trailer that should have anything but on it. Sheesh.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaFirst
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitayou already know this movie will make a lot because of one single man...<br><br>Denzel Washington
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaThe boobs are enough for me to go see it
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI hope this movie goes off really well!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaEpic...Pratt in a western. <br><br>This is going to rock!
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaFor such a big movie the marketing of this has been surprisingly low key.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaI hope this movie do well.
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshita\m/ \m/
q-RBA0xoaWUdelimeterByIshitaHigh hopes for this movie

RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaIt is terrifying that the animators chose to animate so many realistic teeth on a jar of peanut butter rather giving him one long, cartoony mono tooth.

RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaAnd that&#39;s why you do research before going off to watch something.
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaWhen I first saw this, I was like at first &quot;Ok this is kinda cute...&quot; and when it gets to the part at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDm_jsvksQQ&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a>, my reaction went to &quot;WHOA NOW!&quot;
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaIs it just me or is this movie getting a resurgence lately?
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaYou know, the movies much more funny when someone isn&#39;t swearing every 3 seconds.
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaMy family put the movie up on TV until they heard that F word
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitareminds me of that regular show episode where the sausages want to be eaten
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaI was little when this came out and I dint know why my dad dint what me to whatch this and I&#39;m 13 and know I know
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaHow did they make this whole film without one Foodfight reference?
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaI remember when I went to see this, when the “dirty” part came on at the end I saw a bunch of parents taking their kids out quickly as if there was a fire 😂
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaNo wonder it’s rated r
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaRIP the kids who saw the ending XD
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaIs it funny the trailer said no swear words XD
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaif I was a parent I would believe this was a kids movie
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaWhy did the stupid parents even think it was for kids?! Did they not notice the food gore?!<br><br>Edit: ok guys thanks, it makes sense, I guess. Sorry for yelling lol
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshitaI no longer wanna live in this world
RDm_jsvksQQdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDm_jsvksQQ&amp;t=0m00s">0:00</a> &quot;approved for appropriate audience &quot;

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaNeeds more CGI.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThat speech from the first movie gave me chills. 😭
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaMadre de dios *takes off glasses
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaTHIS IS GONNA BE GOOD!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaLooks better than I thought it would be. I think this will be a fun summer movie to watch at the theater.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWhy do the aliens come back AGAIN on the 4th of July?! Lol
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitapretty awesome
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaisnt this enders game
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaYes, I also came here cause I just saw The Lad Biblie post on facebook.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaLooks horrible.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI suppose the alien ships now have USB ports, so that a virus can be uploaded with current hardware.<br>I&#39;ll give this a miss.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaTake my money
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI have high hopes for this and 2016 being a good year for movies...please don&#39;t let me down Hollywood
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaOMFG <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Nerdgasm">#Nerdgasm</a>

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitahello earth we&#39;re back!

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaPerfect teaser!!!! The story sounds like a great angle for what happens next. CAN.NOT.WAIT!!!!!!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaIncreíbleeeeeeeeeee
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s will Smith at? this film is dump already
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaHmmmmmmmmmmmm feels a bit forced. Love u bb Hemsworth. Ans you, Goldblum. But. Meh.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaYeah this is cool and all but...WHAT ABOUT BOOMER?
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaHelp me move out my parents house <a href="https://soundcloud.com/flow349/hoe-having-options-everywhere">https://soundcloud.com/flow349/hoe-having-options-everywhere</a>
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita10 minutes ago no one cared about this movie, now every one is hyped up. Job well done, this looks impressive. Put Goldblum in anything and I&#39;ll watch it.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaUnder 5,000 Views Club
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita&quot;But nothing can prepare us.... FOR JOHN CENA&quot;
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even miss Will Smith <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23WasSmith">#WasSmith</a>
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaayy lmao
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaOnly here for Jeff Goldblum
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita..... Just what I needed in the middle of finals week
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaMY REACTION, HAS EXPLODED INTO SMITHEREENS! =-O
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaNo Will Smith, No party!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitauhm, Will Smith??!!!?
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitawhy make this movie without Will Smith
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaHello Boys!!!! Today we celebrate our independence day!!!!!!!!!!!!! xD
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaExcellent.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWhere is WILL SMITH WHERE ?
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaMUST GO FASTER! MUST GO FASTER! MUST GO - <br><br>Oh, shoot - wrong movie. Wait ...
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThey coming back for back to revenge see u soon !!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaOriginality is LOST in Hollywood.... but Excited for this...
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI still think it&#39;s BS how they replaced Mae
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not excited for this film because of how good it may or may not turn out to be, I&#39;m excited for this film because it brings epic nostalgia.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks cool. Like every trailer for Emmerich&#39;s movies. Not sold.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI really hope this is as campy and fun as the original.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaActually doesn&#39;t look bad, might go back and see the original
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThis is the reason why we haven&#39;t met aliens yet, &#39;cause we create our own.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitawhere is big willy?
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI find your lack of will smith disturbing
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaNeeds more will smith.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI have a theory there&#39;s another race of good aliens that will join forces with the humans to defeat the bad guys. That ship they found was probably the good aliens and goldblum deduces another race or culture of alien.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWhoever thought to put the original speech in the debut trailer should get a massive raise and promotion.... god tier speech
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaSo they replaced Will Smith with the guy from Survivor&#39;s Remorse who has zero sense of humor? Ok.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT! WE WILL NOT VANISH WITHOUT A FIGHT!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaYeaaahhhhh!!!!!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaLooks so good
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitait must be an beast!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitarealy a good trailer i see all the original cast is back but without will smitt  not such a good idea ..
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThere has been some controversy on the Casting of Patricia Whitmore/Maika Monroe but after seeing the trailer and the movie &quot;THE DUFF&quot;.Yeah..I see why the decision was made and I Approve.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbduDRH2m2M&amp;t=1m06s">1:06</a> that not the father who sacrificed his life in the first movie??
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaafter 20 years will smith become young   yeah why not ?
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaAAAAAAAHHH
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaDidn&#39;t give a hoot about Independence Day 2 15 minutes ago but Goddamn, call me crazy but that trailer sold me..

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThis sure does look dumb.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaInteresting...
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaBill Pullman&#39;s speech from the original really gives this trailer character. It was the best part!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWelcome to earf!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaFOX really wants that box office cheddar 😂😂😂😂

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWill smith???
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaBreathtaking
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThis is what XCOM2 should have been!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWhere there is a will, there&#39;s a way. There&#39;s no will in this film.....
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaI have been waiting a long time for this movie.
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer caught EVERYBODY off guard and it&#39;s better for that because now everybody&#39;s hyped!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaHollywood will make sequels to anything
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaSome CGI effects look unfinished. But I guess that is common in first trailers...
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita2016 is already too much for me!
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaMuch Aliens<br>Many wow

LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitafirst xxxxxxx
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshitaWhere&#39;s Will Smith ? :(
LbduDRH2m2MdelimeterByIshita:)
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI thought Ronald McDonald invented McDonald&#39;s
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaand the awards goes to Michael Keaton
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitafianally something worth watching that aint hero movie or a remake or a 9th part. xD
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI think this movie will get michael keaton another Oscar nod, maybe even a win.<br>This seems like a great movie with a great plot and great cast
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitalooks pretty good... incredibly corny tho
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitabirdman!!!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaAHHH. Nick Offerman looks freaking weird
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMcDonalds: The Movie... America you have proven the entire world right, all you care about is money and food
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&quot;Contracts are like farts.... they smell like rotting vegetables and deviled eggs... or something..... probably.... &quot;
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2uz2XYkbo&amp;t=1m28s">1:28</a> - How bout&#39; you Utavich, you&#39;d make that deal?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitawhen he said &quot;one word&quot; my video started buffering, the anticipation was killing me
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitasounds like an Oscar!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&gt;be american<br>&gt;eat burger<br>&gt;go to cinema<br>&gt;watch burger<br>&gt;get shot
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaName of the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2uz2XYkbo&amp;t=1m11s">1:11</a> ? Can&#39;t remember
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaOscars 2016 Best Picture Award
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaBasically The Social Network, but with McDonalds?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThe beginning of the end for billions of sentient animals, millions of hectares of planet earth and hundreds of thousands of blocked arteries.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaAnother Oscar ???
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThis looks great. I love Michael Keaton so much
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaSo this is how Bruce Wayne got so rich.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaLinda Cardellini @ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2uz2XYkbo&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a>   I hope her role is bigger than it seems
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaWhen Batman meets Ron Swanson
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaBefore Keaton&#39;s comeback I&#39;ve been saying he&#39;s one of the most underrated actors around. Now he has two consecutive best picture wins under his belt and working on his third. Maybe he&#39;ll win best actor next year instead. If anyone here is unfamiliar with a film called &quot;Clean and Sober&quot; then look it up. It stars Michael Keaton and Morgan Freeman and it contains my favorite performance by Keaton.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI really want to watch this.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaguys .. which track ? Captain ?!!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThis film just feels like a big advertisement for mcdonalds, with them talking about how amazing it is, and how the small business owners seem to be the villains for some reason? Such a weird movie.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaKeaton rocks! Can see John Lee Hancock has done terrific job directing this. Definitely going cinema to see this in August. Can&#39;t wait to own Spotlight on DVD too.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m interested...
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI hate Mc Donnels but this looks intresting i also hated steve jobs but that movie was shit
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMeh.... Subway is better.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitamichael keaton just keeps rolling out with awesome flicks. Keaton is the comeback kid of the decade. Cant wait for this.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaFor you consideration Best Motion Picture of the year
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI love you michael Keaton
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMichael Keaton is GOD
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThis movie contains 5,679 calories , 300g of fat , 2097g sodium and 254g of sugar
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&#39;The Founder&#39;; the story of how McDonald&#39;s was founded by Beetlejuice.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaray kroc is the name of milkshake salesman. i just did an essay involving him and mcdonalds
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaSo a based-on-true-story big money american film that breaks the fourth wall? I&#39;m sensing a pattern.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s currently no UK release date =[
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaKeaton may have had the greatest Hollywood come back of all time
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitanext in line founder of KFC followed by .... you know guys!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI wonder if this means movie theaters will allow us to bring outside food (so long as said food is McDonald&#39;s)?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&quot;The one thing that makes Americans fat&quot; that&#39;s a better movie title!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaPRESERVATIVES! PRESERVATIVES! PRESERVATIVES!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;M LOVING IT!!!!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaAnother movie trailer using this &quot;Sax&quot; song....cmon....
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s Patrick Wilson
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaRon Swanson and Fast Food: I think not.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitalongest Mcdonalds ads ever!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThe ad before the trailer was Burger King
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks great, but I get a weird feeling that Michael Keaton&#39;s doing some kind of Matthew McConaughey impression. Is that weird?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitabest picture of 2017 .. mark my words
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI thought Michael Keaton was gonna play Ronald Mcdonald...
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaImagine if this didn&#39;t have the actors it does...
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaRON YOUR MUSTACHE FELL OFF
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThe &quot;The Social Network&quot; of fastfood
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI didn&#39;t see Patrick Wilson in this trailer?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaOscar bait
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaWow, just I think Michael Keaton is on fire these days ?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitahow cancer started
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMichael keaton is the man
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaIm pretty sure this will win an Oscar for best pictue
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitalove the idea
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitadoes anyone ever remember the movie my life with michael keaton??? so good
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaProbably will be more entertaining than the two Steve Jobs&#39; movies that no one gave a shit about.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaNo offence but every time i see Nick Offerman i see Ron Swanson. So Ron Swanson created McDonalds. Good to know.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaSo when does wendys gets its own movies.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&quot;Coca Cola&quot; coming soon! Trust me, it&#39;s gonna happen.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaAh. The reason us Americans are so healthy.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitamatthew mcconaughey is that you?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaOf course Ron Swanson helps come up with the idea of McDonald&#39;snothing more American than that.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI like to eat at McDonald&#39;s. I like the filet-o-fish sandwich. A lot of people don&#39;t like the filet-o-fish sandwich, but I enjoy it. Usually when I go to McDonald&#39;s I get the filet-o-fish sandwich but sometimes I get a quarter pounder sandwich. I did try the Big Mac sandwich once, several years ago, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much. I also like the apple pies. McDonald&#39;s is a good value.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaWHAT?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitajust saw the whole movie
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThought I recognized that voice....Took me the longest time to realize that was Nick Offerman without the mustache
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaJustKidding crew needs to watch this!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI smell an oscar nomination
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaGive this man an Oscar
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaCall me crazy, but I&#39;m calling this will win best picture
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaBirdman was the kick in the pants, Michael Keaton needed to relaunch his career
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaSo glad Michael Keaton is officially back.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI thought it would be bad as Hancock directed it, but it looks quite good. No way it&#39;s going to be an Oscar contender, but maybe we&#39;ll see a nice movie. I pressume that Michael Keaton is going to get GG nomination for that.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitathe new american church, and it ain&#39;t just open on Sundays boys
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaRon Swanson
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMichael Keaton boutta get that W with best actor
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaHow America got Fat! That&#39;s a befitting name for this movie!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaVulture!!!!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitatoo bad it isn&#39;t authentic anymore.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaMichael Keaton and Nick Offerman? Sign me up!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaThe kind of movie where you root for the villain. The brothers seem like asshats right off the bat.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshita&quot;Contracts are like hearts, they&#39;re made to be broken&quot; whoaaa
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaNext up: Jack Nicholson finds Burger KIng thus creating the historic battle between Batman and The Joker.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaI Love Mc Donals for 61 years (1955)!
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaGreat. Now I want McDonalds.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaAh, so It&#39;s the Steve Jobs movie but instead of Apple it&#39;s McDonalds.
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitafirst
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitabirdman with michael keaton won best picture 2014<br>spotlight with michael keaton won best picture 2015<br>2016?
AX2uz2XYkbodelimeterByIshitaBruce Wayne used all his money and riches to help endorse and grow McDonald&#39;s for us? How thoughtful and nice of him. Bruce Wayne is officially the smartest and kindest man that ever lived.

6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaFinally, a  sweet movie you can bring your family to.
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaK camp
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaBeutiful idea. No negativity needed. Yes while it may seem &quot;ghetto&quot; by your standards, it really is a culture that did not wither against Americanization and instead flourished like a blue spruce in Kentucky.
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaFinally a movie about Cars again, about time! No more of those F&amp;F BS! Now I wanna see a movie about Japanese car culture!!
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitayo that&#39;s that one FIFA 14  song
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitano video!? OK, it took awhile then it popped. 
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not Mexican, but I will go support this movie, bc I love seeing other minority try to break into mainstream media. Just hopefully, this movie have good message for younger generation. Gangs and drugs is not way of life....
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaThese chicanos think they&#39;re so latino, but they can&#39;t even speak Spanish. LOL...they got it so good in the good ole USA, but can&#39;t stop whining just like the blacks, gays, etc, but they still hate the Gringo.
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitathis would have been poppin in 2005 low riders are weird now personally coming from a Mexican looks like a good movie though
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the first song in the trailer
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaTrash
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaAnd then Donald trump happened upon him Lmfao
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitayup this is going to be good
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaOk, they&#39;re making a movie about lowriders. Now it&#39;s time for stance cars!!
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m down to watch this!
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaDid not spot Hector from Fast &amp; Furious.😁
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitalooks cool <br>but I&#39;ll wait for it to be on kodi
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitatheo rossi Xicano?

6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshita<b>THIS IS WHY WE NEED A WALL</b>
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitabitches
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitathey should film a 3 seasons show about chicanos and lowriders in LA. That´s a great topic and part of the chicano LA identity. I just hope they don´t put anglos as main characters.
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the song
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaBet white kids are gonna try sealing Latino culture after this.
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaWhy is this movie called lowriders when it has to do nothing with lowriders just a kid who wants to be a famous artist
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitaHow that fuck is that guy the new Flash Thompson
6k0mm_cxzy0delimeterByIshitanow that&#39;s a film damn can&#39;t wait to see this

9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaBrokeblack mountain
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitasome of you saying this is a gay movie, by watching the trailer you know it&#39;s a gay movie? Wow what a sad world we live in.... and suppose it&#39;s a gay movie?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaSo what&#39;s this about again?😐😐😐
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitawhat is this about
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaJANELLE

9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitanigga you gay
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the music? Anyone?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a> You&#39;re my only... ravioli? WTF?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like things have gone downhill for Remy after he left the White House.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitathat was vague
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaI love it i hope its a huge hit
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaRemy Danton!!!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaAnd that folks is how aids was created.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaStill hard to believe people are against homosexuality nowadays? Can&#39;t people just grow up?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaminus the black &amp; gay parts this looks pretty good
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitawhat the eff is the movie about usually the trailer gives the whole movie away but i couldnt catch anything from this
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis seems so interesting, but the problem is that gay movies tend to end so sadly that I&#39;m actually scared to watch this one 😥😫
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaawesome music
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitasnatch my soul!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitalooks good
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaBeautiful trailer, I love A24. A bold studio with a distinct direction in choosing its movies.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaits just like brokeback mountain, but without mountains and without white people.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitahopefully this isn&#39;t just another gay movie where someone recieves shock therapy, goes to prison or dies of aids.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaFuck this looks incredible
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaa24 is just sublime. these motherfuckers just make the best choices.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitashe is acting like one of those BLM people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NJj12tJzqc&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a>
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaCan someone help me find out the music in this soundtrack?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to be so important!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaim so ready. this looks amazing

9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!!! Unfortunately, there may be an uproar from this
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!!! Unfortunately, there may be an uproar from this
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaUgh, I can&#39;t stop watching! It just looks so good, I can&#39;t wait to see it.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitamusic?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just imagining the shit storm that will erupt from the black community if this doesn&#39;t receive Oscar nods.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitawow!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaJANELLE MONAE MY QUEEN MY PRINCESS SO BEAUTIFUL IM CRYING RN
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaBoyz N The Hood: The arthouse edition.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitathis looks great!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitalooks like a great story on something that really ought to be exposed in the black community. Looking forward to seeing it. The cinematography looks excellent
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThe Irritated Genie is not going to like this.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWHOAAAA
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis is such a beautiful film trailer !!!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWesley Morris brought me here.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitahere comes the homophobic black community.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaNo thanks. I&#39;m good. I&#39;d rather  watch cats sing Public Enemy on YouTube.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWelcome to the gay agenda spreading like a cancer through your local media.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the soundtrack ? some one respond please !!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaPlease, please, please don&#39;t let it be another tragic death story. I can&#39;t stand gay movies/shorts that do this. this looks absolutely breathtaking and incredible.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks Awesome :)
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible...definitely looking forward to seeing it
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaI am here for it
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaChills yo.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaMedicine For Melancholy and Tall enough were great films. Hollywood isn&#39;t interested in these films with lead black characters.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaAn intriguing trailer, looks like A24 did it again.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWords cannot describe how breathtaking this looks.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaName of Soundtrack?please
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to see this!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaHe shouldn&#39;t watch.  Just a Troll.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaAndre!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitamoooooosic people??????? :D
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks like &quot;A Single Man&quot; but in the hood.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the music?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaRemy Danton
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks cool as shit
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incredible!
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThe cast and cinematography for this film looks strong! But this movie doesn&#39;t look like my cup of tea but who knows?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaA24 is my favorite distributor.
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so sad. T_T
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaminus the gay part this looks pretty good
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaoscar ....especially this year
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitacan I buy tickets for the opening yet ?
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaA24 stays releasing the best movies
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaman this looks amazing
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitaLooks good. Gotta check this out
9NJj12tJzqcdelimeterByIshitapulling all the stops I see. This looks well produced
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t leave me murph!!!!!  MURPHHHHH!!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry what is this movie about. I must&#39;ve got lost in her eyes. &lt;3 <br>^____^
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaJessica is super hot, but this movie looks boring as hell.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a glorified biased propaganda film with chrome paint. . . PASS
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaLeft wing shit flick, karl marx would be proud
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaA house of cards style political drama movie does sound nice, but so far the trailer makes the antagonist too &quot;I&#39;m evil muhawawa&quot; for me. Maybe just trailer issue so will need to see more when it comes out.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaOoh, this is beautifully directed and Jessica looks stunning!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaHahaha I forgot, America likes to make movies about change now..why bother legalizing gay marriage or cannabis or abolish slavery, when you can just make a dramatic Hollywood piece of shit movie about that.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaGreat cast, great director. I&#39;m in.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaDAAAAMMN.... I am not, nor have I ever been, a Jessica Chastain fan. I think she always plays her same old bland self in every single movie she is in (The Tree of Life, A f**king Most Violent Year, Interstellar, Zero Crap Thirty) except maybe The Help, where she was servicably decent. With that said, this movie looks frikkin fantastic, and I hope it&#39;s as good as it&#39;s trailer! It could be this decades Michael Clayton if it&#39;s handled well enough. :)
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaRather see Jessica Chastain  in the Fifty shades Darker trailer.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaDID YOU KNOW DAD?!?! DID YOU ABANDON US
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitacrazy azz biatch is all I have to say about that
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitawhat a gifted actress, and she&#39;s likely too old to have her own children anymore. There&#39;s always a price to pay.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI just wish they wouldn&#39;t have made this biased...
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaThis is either going to be absolutely awesome or absolutely bland.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaGay
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaMr. Clayton, I&#39;d like you to meet Ms. Sloane.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaSay no more. You give me Jessica Chastain and my butt is in the theater day one.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought of Hillary?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI read the script....amazing, can&#39;t wait to see it in movie form at last.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaSo is this movie about gun control and how guns are bad?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaStunning and smart amazing
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaCast is on super point. Not a fan of lionizing and humanizing the lobbying industry, however. Even it is in the service of a lefty cause like gun control about which I&#39;m passionate. Lobbyists are a scourge on the ass of the American political system.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaHillary Clinton biopic before she&#39;s dead? What gives?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaThe song in the teaser trailer is WHEN I GO by Keaton Simons, Laura Goldfarb &amp; Smith Carlson
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshita<b>MURPHYYYYY!!!!!!!   MURPHHHHHH!!!!!!! DON&#39;T LET THEM BUY ASSAULT RIFLES MURPH!!!!!</b>
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaAre you ready for mommy kino?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaYeah, this movie won&#39;t be divisive at all...
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitashall not be infringed.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitathe song/music was also used in suits. dont know which one it is though. :)
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI for one find it hilarious that a movie on the US gun lobby had to come from a European film studio
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing 💕
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaA fantasy about liberals repealing the second amendment. lol!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaFunded by the Clinton Administration
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaShe reminds me of the Danish Girl, no offence!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitastrong unapologetic female leads, yass
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaMark sloan I thought you were with lexi
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaA liberals wet dream: the movie!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaThe smell of liberal politics is strong with this one. The face of gun crime in America is a coloured face. I&#39;m sure this movie will portray that accurately.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaMUUURRPHHH
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaLost me at gun control.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitathis about the NRA?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitalook like the female version of house of cards
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaTBH you were surprised when Mark Watney was alive.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaJessica is ...and always will be a legend.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely Myfanny Thomas
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaJessica Chastain needs to eat a sandwich.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitajessica chastain is a national treasure
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t do it Murph..
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaHouse of Cards ftw!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitafake and gaay
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitagun control movie.. I foresee good reviews but dismal box-office. No one but die hard gun control leftists will see it.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaantigun movie?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitawell she&#39;s definitely more attractive than Hillary Clinton
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaive never been this early for a trailer
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaPolitics, am I right?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaHouse of Cards: soon in theaters !
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaNahh
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaHouse of cards: the movie then?
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d rather have her over Hillary and Trump any day
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitahaha my name is Sloane spelt the same way and everything
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaI keep getting her and Bryce Dallas Howard mixed up
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMUkfmUu44k&amp;t=0m40s">0:40</a> NOBODY EXCEPTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!!!!!!!!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaThe song is called FREEDOM by Anthony Hamilton &amp; Elayna Boynton if you&#39;re wondering. It was in the movie DJANGO UNCHAINED.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaYes.
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie trailer with Bryce Dallas Howard!
AMUkfmUu44kdelimeterByIshitaWell this looks anything but subtle... nicely cut trailer tho.

COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaMixed emotions. Tell me what to feel!!!
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitawhere the hell is wolverine?! <br>where is he? -__-
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaBY MY HAND...YOU SHALL RISE...FROM THE ASHES...OF THIS WORLD...WE&#39;LL BUILD A BETTER ONE
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitawheres wolverine?
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaMORE EXCITED FOR THIS THAN BATMAN V SUPERMAN OR CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitathe hype
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshita&quot;He got that from the bible&quot; &quot;Or they got that from him...&quot; Great line! Looks so good! Should&#39;ve had Wolverine as one of the main horsemen though.... Missed opportunity. I&#39;ll bet anything that he&#39;s in it somehow. Either a cameo or a smaller role, but I&#39;ll take it. Glad they&#39;re saving him for the movie. Can&#39;t wait!
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshita2016 is going to be so good
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaLooks baller
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaThis is Awesome.

COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaeh, I may pass on this.  hopefully this will be the last xmen movie.
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaSophie being cast as Jean Grey still makes me so happy.
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitao filme mas aguardado
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait omg so happy
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaI wonder how many people are going to complain that this is almost exactly like the comic con trailer.  Let&#39;s remember folks that someone ILLEGALLY recorded it and everyone ILLEGALLY watched it because it was only meant for those who were at comic con. <br><br>Anyways,  I love it!!!
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaEU NÃO TO NEM CHORANDO TO SÓ TREMENDO
COvnHv42T-AdelimeterByIshitaASSIM MEU CORAÇÃO NÃO AGUENTA!

rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve waited years for this I&#39;m so happy
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaCant wait.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshita&quot;I need you to deliver a message&quot;-shoots his feet- gg
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThe power of ombré 🙌🏽😄
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaFeels like this was brought back from the late nineties. Budget cuts?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait for it...Love you Seline💕
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;t=0m57s">0:57</a> is that king Arthur from Merlin.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaWhat number is this one? I saw the first which was ok the second was like watching the 1st one again. They are trying to drain the very last out of this cash cow.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaAnyone else think Kate Beckinsale should play Bayonetta if there was ever a movie made!?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaGIVE me more!!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale in tight shiny outfit.....must watch.  😍😙😄😆   just kidding
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitai can&#39;t hardly wait for this movie come out !!!!!!!!!!!!!! let&#39;s see Witch movie could be great Underworld Blood Wars or Resident Evil Final Chapter ???
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThey showed way to much in the trailer
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitacan&#39;t wait..she&#39;s my favorite vampire ever
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitawho else feels like they saw the whole plot to this movie?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaesto va a estar interesante enero llega rápido <br>quiero ver lo que preparó esta saga que aún mantiene la esencia de curiosidad desde el inicio
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaawesome
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitai wait
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMs. Beckinsale is back in leather!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaYay!! Loved it &lt;3 &lt;3
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaGoT vs Divergent
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaEpic and badass trailer
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThat female vampire is the female version of Kraven she&#39;s hungry for power &amp; seeing that Selene is unharmed by daylight she wants to be the most powerful.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaSo it looks like Selene &amp; Eve got separated but the way Selene that she doesn&#39;t know where her daughter is could lead us to think that maybe Eve went off on her own to find her dad Micheal. But why go after just Selene &amp; Eve Micheal is a hybrid as well.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale does it again not many women actresses can take a lead role &amp; turn it into a 4 sequels usually roles that are lead by men. Kate was &amp; still is the right choice to play Selene she embodies the vampires warrior any other female actress to play Selene &amp; Underworld would never have spawned 5 sequels.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI just wanna know the trailer music in the background
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitafalling  in reverse
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaSo this and resident evil all in 2017 jan 😕 really sony space these movies out a bit move one in feb keep Underworld as it is 😁😁
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaomg I can&#39;t wait
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been waiting!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitais it me or I hear a piano at the beginning of every trailer these days?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll never pass on seeing Kate Beckinsale in spandex
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaSelene on a motorcycle, cool.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitalatex and her bloody accent :)
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMy body is ready
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThis has to be one of the worst trailers ever, and im not talking about the movie, im talking about the way it is cut/presented its weird
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaWOW
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaJesus blood splats and nudity in a green ban trailer, awesome
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaYAAAAAASSSSSSS!!!!!!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaA Underworld and Resident Evil trailer comes out on the same day? Looks like Sony is competing against itself
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaKate Beckinsale in leather. What more do I need to say?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaHmm... between 15-25% Rotten Tomatoes
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaFeel like I just saw a summary of the whole plot of the movie.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitawhat happened with Eve n Michael?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThe lack of Michael in the trailer is disturbing.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaAs long as they keep putting Kate Beckinsale in tight leather Ill gladly keep giving these movies my money
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m starting to think Kate Beckinsale is a vampire in real life, cuz she looks the same in everything. And that&#39;s hot.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThey say &quot;You must...&quot; a lot.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AWWWSOMEEEEEE
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaDid they just show this whole movie?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaSo ... we all just saw her right about to kill both the vampire bad guys and the werewolf bad guys, right?? So much for suspense lol
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaHalf the music is from the force awakens, batman v superman, and captain America civil war trailers mixed together with other music and it is EMBARRASSING to Sony
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaIt sounds weird hearing Tywin say: You must go to north. hahha

rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaHow is victor alive?  I may have missed it in one of the sequels but didn&#39;t she kill him for good?  And the other movie he was in was a prequel?

rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaAWESOME
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMy boy is ready!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitathis franchise should have ended after evolutions
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaWUT?
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> - music from Batman v Superman trailer
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI know this won&#39;t be a great movie. But I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m still going to watch it!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMoronic pretentious trash for preteen fucktards.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaKing Arthur working with Irene Adler? I&#39;m a little worried.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait! Looks action packed as always. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and badass. She needs to be in Marvel or DC film!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaToo many scenes from the previous movie mixed, I don&#39;t like that.<br>But anyway, everyone is pretty excited to see Kate rocking out again :D
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaonly the classic franchises can save cinematography in this genre !
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaLooks better than the last one (and of course 3) but dat Theo James... :( gtfo
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaI just wanna see Kate Beckinsale in tights...
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaLmao this movie and the new Resident evil trailer are so similar
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaWow, looks dumb! I lost hope after the shitty last one.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;t=0m53s">0:53</a> Great car!
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaSony, feel free to contact me to discuss why you have misjudged the audience in creating this product and how you can better improve the next.

rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaLooks <b>EPIC</b>
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMy lord the CGI looked horrendous at the end...
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaThis one looks good actually! Hopefully. Kinda hard to live up to the first one, which was perf.
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaMeh..
rKHL5PyAPzsdelimeterByIshitaAla

2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaCame for Shay
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWow I&#39;m surprised that no one commented about how beautiful Jennifer still is..
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThe best thing about this trailer was Owl City. I&#39;m leaving now...
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitatotally in love with Jennifer Anniston
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought it looked very similar to Blended?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI smell a Happy Ending!!!
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaAnother one of those &quot;special day&quot; movie...<b>sigh</b>.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaFather&#39;s Day - 2018. Starring Jason Sudeikis, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Zac Efron, Will Ferrell and Seth Rogen.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaOh! Look it&#39;s that same movie we see every year!
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaShay❤️
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaElla Anderson is in this movie
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThe film looks ok, great actors, but the trailer HOLY HELL it&#39;s awful!
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitais there a father&#39;s day movie coming soon?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI think I just got diabetes...
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaVOICE OVERS FOR TRAILERS IS SOOOOO DATED. STOP IT HOLLYWOOD…. STOP IT!! &quot;The ONE day that connects us all&quot;!?!?!?! HAHAHA WHAT a load of crap!! That trailer was embarrassing… sorry but really really bad.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThis will either be good or bad, no in-between.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitadid i somehow time travel to 2001
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaKate hudson,Jennifer aniston, Shay mitchel, ... AWESOME  !
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaoh god noooo!!! tampons!!!!!! the humanity!!!!!!!!!
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer literally made me angry
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitacheesy ass movie,the narrator for the trailer just makes it more cheesy tbh
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaJack Whitehall pulling Brit Robertson
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWoman aren&#39;t funny.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThe transitions look like it is a low budget student film
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaSafe, generic, formulaic pablum...yay!
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI am pretty sure Kate is lesbian in this one. Also, yeah, same old same old, something something DAY, all Star cast, Julia Roberts, bc she&#39;s a superstar, conection bla bla bla. When will Holloween be out though? Or like, some other, weird holiday? Anyone??
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWeird seeing shay mitchell kiss a guy lol
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThis is the whitest shit ever.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaLooks like shit
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaDid a human write this? Or a machine created by Hollywood execs to churn out predictable, unimaginative scripts that follow the most basic structure possible that somehow makes shitloads of profit?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d watch this if it was only Jason Sedekis&#39;s story.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshita&quot;blended&quot; Remake?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaA pretty used up concept. Amazing cast, but that&#39;s all that is there to look forward to in this trailer.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWhats up with the 90&#39;s movie voice guy making an appearance in 2016?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitawhat`s next father`s dad?
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like garbage.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaits been a while since i heard a trailer being narrated that is not an &#39;honest trailer&#39;
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitatrailer highlights..<br>&#39;free bowling&#39; <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BPr217zLps&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a>-054 reminded me of the same kinda scene from blended
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaJennifer and jason doing like there 4th movie together
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitadefinitely doesn&#39;t look like that one Adam Sandler movie with Drew Barry more
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaJennifer Aniston, say no more. 😘😍
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaJack Whitehall is fuckin it
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was another SNL spoof. Unfortunately I was wrong.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaIs this fake? I was waiting to see scenes from the fake feel-good Shining trailer.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaSo we got Rachel and Elliot. This is going to be a never ending love story with infinite break up ups and getting back together.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaJason looks like the only fun character
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaTry keanu 
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaFor a moment in there I thought this might be a tv series.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaWell hello Emily from PLL
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaCan we stop with the background voice gosh
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitawhy ?<br>so many decent actors...

2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaHappy Mothers Day! Comedy Movie 🎥 Like it.
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaI want my money back
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaAwesome To See Jennifer Aniston !! 😍
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaBlablabla
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaThis is just like Blended, with a slight plot difference...
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitait is 2006
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaاول عربي
2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaTrailer looks like it was made in 2001. This concept is a bunch of moms meet love actually. It didn&#39;t work out well with New Year&#39;s Eve and Valentine&#39;s Day was okay.

2BPr217zLpsdelimeterByIshitaFirst comment
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Garfield couldn&#39;t do an accent even if his life depended on it
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaIt looks so good! I can&#39;t wait! Scorsese is easily my favorite director of all time.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitastarwars
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaOkay I&#39;m just going to say it. THIS movie should have been filmed in GLORIOUS 70MM. Not that waste of film by Tarantino.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaLooks great!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFinally, Some redemption after the shit of wall street.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThis music is just breathtaking!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaHollywood bullshit. Give me a break with those accents and why does every shot of Garfield have him looking like he just stepped out of the salon and makeup room?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitageez adam driver is so ugly lol
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaRemember that time Kylo Ren and Spiderman rescued Qui-Gon Jinn from the Trade Federation…
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitathis is like the last samurai and spider man in one movie. gonna be epic!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaforget about la-la land, hacksaw ridge, moonlight, or hell or high water. Cause fucking is here Scorsese and  he&#39;s going to buttfuck  this year&#39;s Oscar&#39;s.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaKylo Ren is there to preach the Way of the Sith?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThe Music , the acting...just wow!!! It&#39;s going to be another Scorsese magic
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaghey
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie if it wasn&#39;t about religion and spreading the disease
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAh good. A movie of how Catholicism failed to take-hold in Japan. Noice.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaplot looks boring as shit people will eat up anything famous directors put out
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaScorsese is one of the few directors out there that you can honestly say was born to make movies.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaI love Scorsese but.. I&#39;l pass.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThe accents are really off-putting.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitayawn. More religious nonsense.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaHe said the title of the movie in the movie.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaГде Ди Каприо?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaWell it&#39;s about time we got a trailer! haha
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaOh man, I just finished writing my college essay on Christian persecution during the Tokugawa Era. I m going to watch this!!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY THE TRAILER, OMG. I was like &quot;Why don&#39;t you just release already??!?!&quot; IT TOOK FOREVER.<br>Looks great, Scorsese won&#39;t disappoint, he loves so much the novel.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAndre Garfield getting an oscar next year bro
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitadoes look interesting, but what in the hell is up with that accent?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaHuh
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaIs the samurai who smells of sunflowers in this?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitasecond oscar on the way mr scorsese
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThe celebrity of the actors were distracting to me. They&#39;re too famous, and I just saw hacksaw ridge
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaWho the fuck dislikes a Martin Scorsese Trailer?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaReligion!!! The most effective weapon of the European colonist and expansionist to conquer and pillage their way throughout history.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Marvel Team-Up 2016: Kylo Ren &amp; Spider-Man (Jesus Edition)&quot;
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitahere before 10,000!!! anyone else there?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaNot gonna lie kind of reminded me of &quot;There Will Be Blood.&quot; Especially the music.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaSpiderman and Kylo!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer has better shots than 99% of Hollywood
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitalooks like some white man douche knowledge
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaspiderman in  japan whaaa
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitainb4 &quot;oscar bait&quot; comment from transformers fans
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Garfeild is getting an Oscar nomination this year.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAdam Driver gets one good movie role and now we have to see this ugly fucks face in every mediocre movie for the next 2 years because they blew their budget on one actor and the rest just play 5-15 minute cut up roles.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAwful trailer. Still want to see it though.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitais the view at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqrgxZLd_gE&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a> a real place? where?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitanever thought i would be excited for a movie about Christian missionaries.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaLooks shit, fuck religion.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaEven though it doesn&#39;t have that sort of action... I got an AC: Black Flag vibe from this.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaTake deep breath at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqrgxZLd_gE&amp;t=0m51s">0:51</a> when scorsese&#39;s name appear with awesome soundtrack 😪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThis triller is too dam perfect🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏼<br>Andrew Garfeild this year has great chances in two great movies with great directors<br>How lucky this boy👏🏼
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaWould not surprise me if everyone speaks English, unfortunately...
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaSooo, The Mission in Japan?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s amazing. Another masterpiece by mister Sorcese
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaawesome BGM... Andrew Garfield rocked this year...<br>1st with Hacksaw Ridge now with Silence.... <br>Martin Scorsese is always best.... one of the best director living in the world....
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaRead the life of Cristóvão Ferreira. Really messed up and sad.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaconfirmed oscar
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really liking what I am seeing
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaKylo, Spiderman, and Liam Neesons. <br>what ?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThe accents are pretty awful to be honest.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Garfield will get a nomination this year, mark my words. Along with Marty but thats obvious!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaMy body is ready for this. Come soon 23rd December!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaMonsters.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitawow this looks amazing
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaHmmmm... Not sure about those accents. Looks pretty though.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshita1st DISLIKE<br><br>Hated this piece of shit of shit trailer
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s probably just me, but I&#39;m not buying Andrew and Adam in these particular roles.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaMARK!!!!!!!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaadam driver lost weeeiiiiiiiiighttt brrooooooo. RIP Gainz
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitathis will not be a christian film because martin aso directed last temptation
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaI got a Kirk Lazarus feel from that.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaSpider Man went way down hill.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaBest Picture winner 2017 for sure!!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaSo basically a sequel to Hacksaw Ridge
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaDude Paramount is seriously gunning hard for the awards this season with Arrival, Fences and Silence. Except them to come home with a lot of awards
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFirst Hacksaw Ridge &amp; now Silence, Andrew Garfield is on a roll !! <br>Been a fan of his work since The Social Network. hope he atleast gets an Oscar nomination this time
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing but not something id watch
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitamy immense respect to scorsese and i am his biggest fan ... and i dont expect it to be the story of spreading Christianity to asia ... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23secularthought">#secularthought</a>
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thought Andrew delivered his lines in the weirdest way possible? <br><br>definitely seeing this though
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThis music in the trailer sound like it could be in a Paul Thomas Anderson film. But, this movie from Scorsese looks fantastic and mystifying.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaACCENTS OH GAWD ACCENTSSSSSS
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be another &quot;Last Temptation of christ&quot; but with a whole lot more Suffering
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFor this film
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaThere is very much chances of getting nominations in Oscar
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaIs Quentin Tarantino as good as Martin Scorsese?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaIf this movie ends up being as amazing as it looks, it&#39;s going to sweep the Oscars..
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m there opening night. This looks INCREDIBLE!
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like Scorsese&#39;s coming with everything he&#39;s got. Cannot fucking wait.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaDamn, that was intense
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaand the Oscar goes to ..
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFinally this fucking thing comes out. This might be Martin&#39;s last picture
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaswag
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaNever thought I would see Qui-Gon, Kylo Ren and ex Spiderman in the same film.
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaHey now that you got rid of that stupid claim on your official video, you think it could be removed on our reaction?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaWho tf dislikes a Martin Scorsese movie trailer?
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFinally..
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitagreat trailer
IqrgxZLd_gEdelimeterByIshitaFirst
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaNo friggggin way in this Gods earth did they need to kill off Tom.  Sad beyond words
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaMovie lacked drama and impact. I like that kind of movies, to watch using boxxy software app on my android phone.
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMh1EvAQOQ8&amp;t=0m08s">0:08</a> that editing fail XD
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaThis movie was genius. And Bill Nighy better and better with every role he play.  Romance, War, Comedy, Drama ...in one word ...this was AWESOME!

mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaWatch for the place in the movie where they&#39;re all dashing for the air-raid shelters .... while the sirens are sounding the ALL-CLEAR!!  (A single continuous note - when warning of a raid, the siren varied regularly in pitch.)

mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitawent and saw this film. fantastic. sad and funny. Sam caflin adorable
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaThis movie suffered from too many dark interior shots. The woman lived in a dumpy apartment and worked in a dumpy office building. I can&#39;t believe London doesn&#39;t have any beautiful and luxurious buildings, even back in 1940. Movie also lacked drama and impact.
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaThe movie is much better than the trailer
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshita,
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaI believe this film contains spoilers for this year&#39;s Chris Nolan movie
mMh1EvAQOQ8delimeterByIshitaIs this based on a true story?
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaOne of the best movie i&#39;ve ever watch
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaone of the best movie of all time &amp; the best superhero movie
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaRIP Heath.<br><br>Your performance will never be topped.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThe best batman movie ever...
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita&quot;You know how I got these scars?&quot;<br>&quot;you will&quot;
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest superhero movie hands down<br>Best performance by an actor in a villain&#39;s role Period. <br><br>This movie just strikes you, not abruptly, but subtly. This is such a well made movie, such well directed, the deep plot and magnificent performance by most of the actors. <br>One of the best. Period.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita&quot;This city deserves a better class of criminal, and I gonna give it to them&quot; - that&#39;s the real shit 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitala mejor película de batman un super héroe nectamente humano gracias ala WB POR EL CABALLERO DE LA NOCHE
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaTHE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitalove this movei
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaIts it me or does this trailer feels like a marvel trailer it just have action darknes and fun 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitathey were wrong and nothing is impossible
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis Heath Ledger joker is better than the old Jack Nicholson Joker.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI still remember like 7 or 8 years ago when I came across hateful comments on Heath when he was casted as the Joker. It&#39;s unbelievable how people just bashed him being casted because of his sweetheart movies and the Brokeback mountain. <br>What actually hurts me more was not only that he died at such tender age but he didn&#39;t feel the appreciation on his performance for himself longer than he felt experienced criticisms before the release of the dark knight trailer.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest comic book movie and superhero movie ever made 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaharvey;THE NIGHT IS DARKEST JUST BEFORE THE DAWN WEIRD BECAUSE DAWN OF JUSTICE IS COMING OUT AFTER THIS
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaStill my favourite movie, watched it  over 15 Times.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThey totally shouldn&#39;t have showed the jokers face in the trailer, would have made for a much better reveal in the bank rob scene in the beginning.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaWhat a great movie ever! Great batman great joker... great soundtrack .. great story .. graet end.. anyway is in my favorite list of movies of all the time #2 .. just after Gilda.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaHeath ledger was the best joker :(
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI hope they will take  Johnny Depp for the Joker role
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaNothing will come close to the SUMMER of 2008.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis is the single greatest movie of all time hands down. From Christian Bale&#39;s Batman to Heath Ledger&#39;s iconic Joker every one that was in this movie was at their A game and there are no weak links. I dare anybody to find a flaw with this movie. West and Keaton&#39;s Batman&#39;s were fantastic but Bale&#39;s and the rest of the dark knight trilogy are hands down the best.﻿
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaJust watched the film. I wouldn&#39;t considered it as the best film but it&#39;s one of the best of the decade... Though one thing is for sure, it has the greatest supporting role of all time. It&#39;s because of Heath Ledger why this movie is considered as great film. Heath Ledger just proved the he is indeed one of the greatest actors of all time.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaSuch a terrible trailer, completely misrepresents the movie. The Dark Knight was bleak, brutal, depressing and nothing short of brilliant. This trailer makes it seem as though it was some random comic book film that&#39;s stupid and comedic. I hope it&#39;s erased from the history of the world.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaIs it weird that i find the joker extremely attractive? Not the way he looks but just his character is SO sexually attractive to me, its ridiculous :D<br><br><br>Edit: To everyone who thinks im a slut, can i just say that in real life i wouldn&#39;t be attracted to psychopath. And yes probably i am a sapiosexual because his intelligence (despite the psychopathy), is the attractive part. And I don&#39;t see why that should be something i should be ashamed of. Heath Ledger himself just has an amazing talent for acting and an aura that goes through the character he plays in batman.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitathe only problem i have is why the fuck?! they change Katie Holmes to that ugly ass bitch Maggie Gyllenhaal?!  in this movie joker said a line? Hello beautiful! biggest lie! that&#39;s why he died he couldn&#39;t Live with himself!!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest Batman Movie Ever! Best movie adapted from a Comic Ever!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita<b>I LOVE THIS MOVIE!</b>
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaIts like wen they do a Batman movie with the joker its amazing, all the other movies where bad except tdkr and batman returns
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaSuper trailer
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaHeath Ledger died in 2008 because he had an overdrove his birthday is on the 4th April  so now it&#39;s 2015 so he will be 35 because  when he died he was 28.<br><br><br>
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaA masterpeice that MARVEL cannot touch.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitashush
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaRIP Heath Ledger :( xx
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaHeath ledger  was a legend and still is a legend . His performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight  is beyond life
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaAwesome
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaawesome music.......
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaGreat memories!!!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why superman is preferred great I think bat is gr8
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Heath Ledger
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaOh god! I hate this trailer because I remember first seeing it and I still ridiculed the fact that Heath Ledger. The guy from Brokeback Mountain was the joker. Fuck me what a judgemental prick. But I’ve went and done the same with with Affleck and Eisenberg! 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitai hope zack snyder does what christopher nolan did in batman trilogy for his batman vs superman movie.<br>IT WOULD BE EPIC
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaR I P Heath Slater best actor ever!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI hope somewhere in the parallel universe there&#39;s a Dark Knight Rises that has Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaHeath&#39;s laugh gives me chills still
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitawell Mr. Ben Affleck .. can you give us such a performance or you think it&#39;s easy only with big muscles ..
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t much joker parts than the film
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita&quot;You either die A Hero.., or you live long enough to see yourself become The Villain...&quot;<br>-Harvey Dent.<br><br>Well said...B)
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaยอด
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI feel ashamed that I&#39;ve never watched this...I&#39;ve only seen parts of it 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P Heath Ledger<br>after six years we still feel the pain of losing such a great talent.<br>we won&#39;t forget you.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI think this was a brilliant trailer but I felt it revealed a little too much if you know what I mean
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaOMG...this was released on my birthday... xD
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaRip heath ledger
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitabest movie
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s no doubt about it! This is an awesome trailer and the Dark Knight is one of the best films ever made. It&#39;s definitely the best action thriller I&#39;ve ever seen and it&#39;s part of my top 10 list of the best movies of all time. Nolan is a brilliant director and Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer. Christian Bale is a good action movie star and the best and most realistic Batman ever. Heath Ledger was an excellent actor and his performance as the Joker was his last and best of his career. Everything about this movie is great and this is the most realistic version of Batman and the Joker that I&#39;ve ever seen! I love it! The Dark Knight was an instant hit and it will always be mentioned as one of the best movies ever. It&#39;s truly a masterpiece! Anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it, watch it!!! You&#39;ll love it!!!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitabest bad guy in a batman movie HEATH LEDGER made this movie great.<br> no1 will ever be even close to H L in batman movies
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitajoker wins not at force reversal in scenes against govt usa, earth fire shattered like glass around him he is painted silver with his costume . LW 2015 ps silver hair 2 he has.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest Batman movie since Batman 1989, hands down
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis film very interesting i suggest to see it! Especially in this film well play a role Heath Ledger in role Joker!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaWhy  a brilliant actor like Christian Bale chose to play in a shit movie like Exodus is beyond me.<br>Leonardo Dicaprio, has only been in successful movies, why? Because he chooses to play in movies that he believes in first and for money second.<br>I hope Christian Bale chooses he&#39;s future movies smartly not because of greed. He is an amazing actor! Keep that reputation up.﻿
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita<br>
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThe Dark Knight, the greatest movie ever made that&#39;s based off a chess piece.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think they can ever make a movie like this anymore.. it&#39;s impossible to top this!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaIt is simple. We kill the batman !!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitalot&#39;s of ass kisser on the internet... these actor&#39;s and singers and sports stars... don&#39;t give a dam about any of us... we need to stop going to movies and sporting events and concerts ..and start paying attention to our familys , our city&#39;s and childrens... I bet ticket prices will fall and these people will start thinking about who pays their bills....
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI remember when it was announced that Heath Ledger would star as &quot;The Joker&quot;. He did good in Monster&#39;s Ball &amp; The Patriot but was sort of skeptical about him starring as the Joker. When I saw it in theater his performance hands down made that movie into what it became &amp; he blew the Joker character out of the water. Greatest recent performance I believe. From his mannerisms to his chaotic scenes in my eyes make him the greatest villain ever. Sad that he&#39;s gone but his talents as the Joker will never be duplicated. RIP Heath
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest dark knight movie...d knight rises was a boring disappointment.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitano doubt, the best batman movie. 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaTrailer #1 ?
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaSix years later, and this trailer STILL excites. 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaGood evening ladies and gentle men.....Lol
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaSome men just want to watch the world burn
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaPlease Spider-Man 2 (2004)
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita&quot;Because he&#39;s not our hero. He&#39;s a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight...&quot;<br>SO EPIC !!! xP
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaRachael was so much hotter in batman begins, douse anyone know why she didn&#39;t continue the role?
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie!!<br>I read something about how this movie prooved a ton of fanboys to be wrong. When Nolan said he wants Ledger as The Joker, every fanboy flipped out and said &#39;&#39;what this pretty-boy is supposed to be The Joker? You gotta be kidding!&#39;&#39;<br>Later then all went crazy for it.<br>I also read that Heath Ledger improvised a lot in it.<br>Best Batman movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaWow, what a great description.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s so dangerous :)
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita&quot;this city deserve a better class of criminal...&quot;
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaChristian bale is so fucking hot 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitadid you guys know that joker looks like jeff the killer
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer revealed a wee bit too much...
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThe Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies of all time, along with the Godfather and Shawshank Redemption, not bad for a movie after the 2000&#39;s
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitathis epic movie was released 6yrs ago today...
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaawesome movie, marvelous performance by Heath Ledger may he rest in peace
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaR.I.P
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXeTwQWrcwY&amp;t=2m14s">2:14</a> brings a smile to my face everytime I watch this trailer.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis was definitely better than TDKR!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaOMG!  This moving looks awesome I have to go see it!  Oh wait, I already did . . .  I need to watch this again! 
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBelieve it or not I think the Dark Knight was better than the Dark Knight Rises, and I thought that movie was good. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to see Batman in the Superman movie.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaBest one in the series.the joker was AWESOME
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best batman movies so far.<br>Joker could have killed batman but he keeps making him survive because he likes to fight him -- see? Joker (heath) was the best and will always be the best batman movie villain...
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaits simple, we kill the BATMAN!!!
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis video is not scarey
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitagreat actor,no one will be like him..heath ledger
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaThis was the best film in the trilogy, followed by Batman Begins. I felt that Dark Knight Rises was a let down as I was expecting something to rival Dark Knight. There was too many plot holes in the final film. Heath Ledger played the Joker better than anyone could have ever wished.
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie<br><br>
EXeTwQWrcwYdelimeterByIshitaLove this film XD
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaSounds like a interesting idea for a film but isn&#39;t it funny how they just NOW get to this type of horror film?<br><br>You know like the cheaply-made horror or indie horror games where you have to sneak along or stay still without making a sound in case of being found or chased.<br><br>I will say this...it&#39;s funny how the blind man has his gun out and then the phone goes off and he shoots it rather than going &quot;Oh that&#39;s just a phone.&quot; But once again a PROBLEM is that we can tell these characters deserve it given at least what the one teen said about the blind man. He&#39;s Blind, Not STUPID. (To paraphrase a quote from a certain Gene Wilder &amp; Richard Pryor comedy.)
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t feel bad for them but don&#39;t kill the hot guy! ( the one without the mustache )
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait!!!!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThe blind man is the bad guy? ENOUGH OF THIS CELEBRATION OF CRIMINALITY  BULLSHIT!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaSo this guys like a serial killer version of Daredevil?
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitalooks interesting.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaOk normally i hate horror movies. HOWEVER. The fact that it looks like there is no magic, or ghosts, or demons involved in  a completely plausible scenario is just fucking awesome, i hope this movie does well.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t even feel bad for them, they&#39;re getting what they deserve. =P
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaAll right, I&#39;m definitely intrigued
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaFirst we have Hush on Netflix, then this movie. I hope this trend of creative horror movies continues.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the good guy will win this one. As it should be.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaShe&#39;s also the girl from Evil Dead!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis is the sequel to Edgar Wright&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t&quot;
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis is so original I love it
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitainteresting
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaJacked old blind guy. ...You can&#39;t trust anyone.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m actually rooting for the blind guy already.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaNow this is what I call a fucking Thriller!<br>None of that fake scary movie cheap bs.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaJane Levy is an amazing actress! The Evil Dead remake was great, I have high expectations for this movie and the trailer is very promising!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawoah !
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawoah
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawish they did spoil with that girl tied up ... but looks really good ill watch it
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie seems like it&#39;s also a thriller! Also how the hell can that blind man out up blockades if he can&#39;t see!?
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good actually. Gave me some &quot;It Follows&quot; vibes in the beginning
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitadon&#39;t mess with the blind man
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaHoly fuuarrrkkkkkk, that blind guy is from avatar, god i hope he becomes cable
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawhat a fucking great concept omg this is insane
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawhat a fucking great concept omg this is insane
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWhat if Daredevil was evil!??? Ok. I&#39;m in. At least they are doing something new.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitathe moral of the movie: don&#39;t rob a house because the owner will shoot you, and he has the right to shoot you.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis is amazing ! I  wannt to see this movie ❤
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaFor some reason this reminds me of that old man who murdered two teenagers after the broke into his home. I think you can find the 911 call on Youtube?
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome 😈
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaSo it&#39;s basically reverse Wait Until Dark?  Very interesting; I&#39;ll be sure to check this out.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaSomething different at least
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaDareDevil is fucking pissed off in his Old Age.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis seems super creative!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaat lease they put some thought behind it
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI knew that was Stephen Lang! Guy&#39;s a heck of an actor! :D
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaIs this movie demonistic? And can someone explain what&#39;s in the basement? This movie looks good but I think it&#39;s demo and I don&#39;t like movies like thatv
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaGood concept, something new finally. Not like the other basic horror films. Not about ghosts so it&#39;s realistic which makes it scarier for me as it makes it more relatable.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaso this is actually hide and seek xD
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaSomething that hasn&#39;t been done before!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great and it&#39;s  a thriller my favorite!!! Yay, a movie that&#39;s not a remake that looks goooood!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaintense. can&#39;t wait to see
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like the first decent thriller in a long while plus the actress looks like she knows how to act
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshita&quot;The Terrible Old Man&quot; is a very short short story by H. P. <br>Lovecraft, written on January 28, 1920, and first published in the <br>Tryout, an amateur press publication, in July 1921.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of the  Lovecraft story The Terrible Old Man.<br><br>Really looking foward to it, he&#39;s a great director.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaEvil DareDevil.  Nice
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of Outlast.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer, but I think it could have used a little less spoilers.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaOK You&#39;ve got my Attention!...
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaVery interesting premise.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait till this comes out
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitabloody genius
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawho the hell is the hostage? that&#39;s my big blank spot.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI like trailers that show off most of it&#39;s unreleased scenes.Saves money and time.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaooooh, looks cool
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI want the blind guy to  shoot the douchbags who broke into his house to rob him :-)
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaDON&#39;T BREATHE<br>don&#39;t see<br>don&#39;t hear<br>don&#39;t life
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaHow did the one guy die???
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t f..k with old wolverine !
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m never impressed by horror movies, but this movie seems pretty freaking unique! it&#39;s so different. I&#39;m definitely going to see it!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis is why I Don&#39;t ever make fun of blind people!!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaIT&#39;S A FUCKING BLIND GUY! SMASH A FUCKING CHAIR OVER HIS HEAD YOU IDIOTS!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitalooks like a good waste of time if you got nothing else to do on a sunday.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaBlack guy first to die. lmao
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks refreshingly original. Im glad to see a new concept in film
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaHedie finaly at end????tell me the punch
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaOh my god, this looks really, really good!! And I don&#39;t say that about movies often
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWhoa!! Just saw this trailer as an ad on a video and had to find the trailer! This is amazing, it seriously got me excited to see this movie! I cannot wait until it comes out! :D
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaActually looks pretty creative
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaLitiiuiuiI&#39;m iul
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaoh dude, this would be so much cooler as a action flick.... mainly because i feel no remorse for the teens
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaShould say from the rebooted evil dead director . Fede Alvarez didn&#39;t created Evil dead Sami Raimi did get it straight ! Fede acts like he did
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawow this looks pretty interesting. watched the whole ad and everything
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks awesome
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t be the only one that finds this awesomely hilarious.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaShe looks like Reece Witherspoon
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaQuestion: Why should I be scared for three people that are robbinng a blind man? This entire movie is just gonna be me saying, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re stuck in the house? Serves you right for robbing a blind man!&quot;
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s a blind old dude, kick him in the balls or bash over the head 2v1 how hard is that?
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaFrom this trailer you would think &quot;brother, sister and nutjob boyfriend who you will ahte from the start and whish he would just die&quot;, and the dude dies even in the trailer. They don&#39;t even try to keep him alive, that&#39;s how much you&#39;re suppose to hate him
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty creepy. Will definitely check this out. I liked what Alvarez and Levy brought to the Evil Dead remake so I&#39;m looking forward to this.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaThis is brilliant. A horror movie with a hyperrealistic killer.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWhile the trailer kinda spoiled some of the movie, it looks interesting.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaA similar story was in the news. An old man waited in his basement for the young kids to break in and shot them.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitacastle. Tv showy<br>  Stana Katic<br><br><br>stana Katic
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t fucking wait to watch this!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaAt last.. a different twist on the home invasion genre.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaPretty unique. Will see it.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWhy would they reveal he has a girl locked up in his basement?!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWow!
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s blind and u cant knock the guy out?
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaWell that&#39;s a unique serial killer. But seriously.....he can&#39;t see you could pretty much drop a goddamn lamp on his head.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaBasically &quot;Stick: Origins&quot;
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitaGreat, another 30% Rotten Tomatoes for 14 year old white girls.
76yBTNDB6vUdelimeterByIshitawhooaaaa 😲😲
