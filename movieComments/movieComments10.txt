H-BWSrFqjMAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t waste your time. Just a bunch of big actors trying to act cool with zero coherent story and a load of unconnected meaningless dialogue and scenes which go nowhere.
H-BWSrFqjMAdelimeterByIshitasuch a great trailer but the film itself is just not enjoyable
H-BWSrFqjMAdelimeterByIshitathis trailer tells me nothing
H-BWSrFqjMAdelimeterByIshitaI am looking vjvb
H-BWSrFqjMAdelimeterByIshitabravo

bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI just finished reading the book üò≠üò≠ I am so excited and can&#39;t wait to watch this movie!!!üò≠
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaas many other people in the comments I just finished reading the book. It was a rush of emotions as were all of her books I&#39;ve read so far and I&#39;d like to watch the movie but I&#39;m gonna give it some time before I do. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m ready yet and also I cannot forgive Ugwu and am definitely not ready to reencounter the character.
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaMagical, love, trust, betrayals, war, life!

bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaGuys don‚Äôt watch it, def watch king of Scotland. But this movie is just boring
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq9jI1QnEXU&amp;t=1m17s">1:17</a> where are you runing to ? <br>me : african meme - y r u running ?! y r u runing !!üòÇ
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s pretty cool watching the trailer after getting all the way through the book, and having a pretty good idea which characters are which. Ugwu looks different from how I imagined him!
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWhere can I watch this??
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI just finished the book and the actor for Odenigbo was EXACTLY how I pictured him in my head. Cant wait to watch this
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaLink
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI have read the book more than 6 times. Watched the movie over 30times
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaJust finished the book
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaJust finshed the book and I gotta say Im most disappointed in Kainene&#39;s appearance- why can&#39;t they just cast women who arent beautiful? Part of her character, part of her role in the story is her being the &#39;unattractive&#39; twin which creates the comparison between her and Olanna. not all women are gorgeous and thats ok!!! worth is not dependant on beauty!!! Kainene&#39;s bold leadership skills are in part based on her not being able to rely on her beauty like Olanna. She may not be beautiful but that led to other skills
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaThe book was amazing
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWow look at Ugwu...I pictured him so well
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWondering what the 1.3k people who disliked this movie are onüòÇ
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI just finished reading the book and I came on YouTube to watch reviews and the see the author talk about the book only to find out there&#39;s a movie! I&#39;m so excited to watch it!!!
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaGreat Novel. I would be glad if they justify Ugwu character.<br>Overall Great Movie. Love from India
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWhich one is better, the movie or book?
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve been to Lagos twice and the two visits rank amongst my favourite trips. I loved this book and enjoyed the film
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t find on Netflix
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWhy does it have 1.3 tho.  duslikes? üôÑü§î
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t seem to get over how emotional I felt reading this book. It&#39;s such a beautiful, compelling and heart-wrenching book. <br>As I read, I could feel tradged looming but won&#39;t have imagined Kainene
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t seem to get over how emotional I felt reading this book. It&#39;s such a beautiful, compelling and heart-wrenching book. <br>As I read, I could feel tradged looming but won&#39;t have imagined Kainene
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaNollywood has really come a long way. Wow!!!
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d like to know what happened to Kainene. For closure.
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaThis is totally worth best film award.
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaLooks good , but wondering why there are more dislikes (1.3k) than likes (1k)
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitabut Olana and Kaneine are as beautiful as they were described love this!!
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaPakistan
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaWatching this after finishing the book is just magicalüòÇ
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve just finished readin the book it excites me to see that there is now a movie .
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaJoseph Mawle üíô love him üôèüèª
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s not olanna
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaUgwu is a bit disappointing for me, he looks a lot older than implied in the book.
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaThe Youroba‚Äôs betrayed the Igbo‚Äôs so sad
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI must say I&#39;m quite happy with the cast üòç‚ù§ can&#39;t wait to watch this
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitathis was overdone..¬†a real let down sadly
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitai have read half of a Yellow sun more than twice. cant get enough of Olanna and Odenigbo. pure love! oh Ugwu&quot; my good man&quot;
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m busy reading the book...it is so amazing
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitasubscribe to my YouTube channel for hilarious jokez
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI am looking for background music of this movie, at the end of this tralier you understand what i mean, if you&#39;ve idea, plz let me know. Regards
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaas a yoruba I ask igbos...what do you call yourselves now in 2018? biafrans? or nigerians?
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaI do not think the actors are picked corrected. The leading male actor should have been older and more reserved whereas the leading female actor should have been younger and sexually attractive.
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitawhy am i just finding out about this?
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is the definition of boring, and the accents and acting are so terrible
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaugwu is too big wtf
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaok but when are they adapting Americanah into a film?
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion, the best Nigerian movie everr...
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaRage bande annonc√©
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaIs Nigeria safe for Americans to visit these days?
bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s another war greater and it&#39;s called &quot;THE BIAFRA WAR&quot; where ¬†millions of people have starved to death because of food blockage in the past six months. One million people. Think about that for a minute. There are almost five thousand Harvard undergraduates. If each one of them died two hundred times, that would be almost a million deaths. Do people also realize that a total number of over 3.6million Igbo&#39;s died in that war between 1967 to 1970. The British, Russia, Egypt, and America supported and armed Nigeria to slaughter people who only wanted to be liberated from the injustice and mass killings of their kind before the war. Why is the world mute on this? Because the top dogs who are busy advocating for peace are fully involved. This is mass genocide and my people are not healed from the wound. To make it worst, Boko Haram, an Islamist terrorist group are killing the Igbo&#39;s also. The blood of my ancestor shall punish all those involved and their generation to generations shall perish.. All hail <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Biafra">#Biafra</a>.. The land of the rising sun.

bq9jI1QnEXUdelimeterByIshitaHalf of a yellow sun( Biafran flag)

SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t know about the historical or cultural debate regarding the accuracy, etc., but it was sure a fun movie to watch. Very authentic Chinatown atmosphere and great martial arts fight scenes. Don&#39;t take it too seriously. Just enjoy....good acting too !
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBruce Lee was such a huge fan of shitty anthemic hip hop, it&#39;s nice to see that finally recognized and appreciated.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaA movie imitating bruce lee without permission.<br>Only the voice is similar, but others are fakes.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitathe one inch punch!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaMeh... nothing will ever be better than Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhat is with the stupid rap music? It doesn&#39;t fit at all. It&#39;s as bad as the music in the Assassins Creed movie trailer.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitakorny
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI think Shannon Lee (Bruce&#39;s daughter) should direct the real version of Lee&#39;s story. Too many people making movies for the sole intent of profit and disregards to history. Shannon should do this before its too late.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaUh, isn&#39;t this the guy that dared Bruce to fight? And Bruce accepted and the fight lasted about 30 seconds with the dude lying in a pool of his own blood? What in the world is this crap?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawhite savior bullshit.    why do whites have to keep kissing their own asses all day long?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a shame that the reviews of this aren&#39;t good - and from what I can tell that&#39;s well founded, unfortunately. I&#39;m not really aware of Bruce Lee as I never got round to watching many of his movies (I prefer Karate but that&#39;s just because I practice it, Lee&#39;s martial art looks badass as well though) but it seems like it could have made a good movie with a good message.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaSo is this supposed to be a comedy or serious? It has many legends and true stories about Bruce Lee mixed in with half a dozen kung-fu movie cliches, so I&#39;m actually not sure!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaEveryone saying this movie is trash, and I&#39;m pretty sure it will be trash compared to the real Bruce Lee but you know everybody here is going to watch it somehow üòÇ
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBruce was not this cocky, onr did he ask for the fight. just a fyi
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI would like to donnie yen play bruce lee but still young
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaHe may not look like Bruce Lee but he sounds like him, has his mannerisms and is cocky. Of course we just HAVE to include rap crap.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawow.. just wow.. the cheese on this.. it&#39;s like a deep dish pizza... the cheese is so stretched!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaNope
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis will be a great movie!!! I wish somehow, the fight was on today.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThe Birh of the üêâ<br>is going2 kickass<br>take names<br>üé•<br>A alsome..<br>2017 get it #!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaLol the one inch punch
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawho else came here cuz of roblox
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaGoing to be a Hollywood mockery of the Master
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBro he is one of the best Kong fu fighter ever
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawow btw watch ip man too <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ipman">#ipman</a>
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWow
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis was an add on roblox. lol
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWho is here because of the Roblox ad?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThere are enough movies by Bruce Lee and documenting Bruce Lee, do we really need another one - simply don&#39;t be ignorant and look them up. <br><br>I don&#39;t think we need another movie to exploit the life of Bruce Lee for money.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaROBLOX SENT ME HERE!!!!!!!!!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaDragon: the bruce lee story was ten times better.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWWE Studios? Not getting my hopes up.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBruce Lee loses
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIn my opinion, I feel like fucking hollywood is going to die. Just like the Disney version of Star Wars. HEY GUYS LETS REMAKE EPISODE 4 AND NOT INTRODUCE ANY FUCKING CHARACTERS? WHO IS WITH ME? <b>Every 12 year old kid</b> I am serious guys, movies are going to be replaced with really long TV shows. Look at Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. Tell me I am wrong and I will reply with happiness. :)
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaDid this channel brought it&#39;s views 8.4 million and only 138 comments?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThese losers look nothing like Bruce Lee and Wong Jack Man
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshita8 mil viws and only 700 likes
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBruce?&gt; Lee?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks incomprehensibly bad... just sayin&#39;
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s really impossible to properly portray Bruce Lee, without Bruce Lee.<br>Because it&#39;s freaking Bruce Lee.<br>Make a movie about his story, not an action loaded &quot;based off of&quot; story. That&#39;s what Bruce deserves.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI love you Bruce Lee. R.I.P. Bruce Lee. Welcome back Lee. <br><br>Bruce Lee game - Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon.; <br><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3dcvky">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3dcvky</a>
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaEpic movie, over a scrimmage that occurred IN A GARAGE. What I fucking hate about these &quot;inspired by true events&quot; is how big of a fish tale the Bruce Lee mythos becomes, when the reality of those scrimmages, is that they were really comparing notes, by applied sparring. I hope that this won&#39;t be as hokey as &quot;The Dragon&quot; from years past.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿµÿ®ÿ≠ ÿ®ÿÆ€åÿ±
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhy do these producers lie?!  That is not the truth!  Jack Kicked Bruce ass and he got hurt so bad they sent Bruce privately to the East Coast at a Hospital so no one here would know what happened to Bruce!  Bruce lost the fight a got beaten up so badly!  He was the one provoking the fight.  The Triads knew Jack would win.  There was only four people there to witness the fight including  Bruce wife who beg Jack to stop and beg one of the Starters to stop the fight before Bruce dies..her exact words!  It&#39;s a shame when they lie and the majority don&#39;t know the truth!  Shame for the martial arts community!  Only two more person who is alive today who witnessed that fight!  Jack Won!  Sent Bruce to the Hospital!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitacRap music for Bruce Lee?!!!   Wallet closed.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaSad how someone thought a movie about Bruce Lee needed fictional components. As far as ficitional marital arts movies, Triple Threat looks like the one to watch.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI pray the music in the movie is NOT the music in this preview. There is so much potential with this story.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshita&quot;Dragon&quot; (1993) was on TV a few weeks ago.  I would recommend an actual Bruce Lee movie over a fantasy hagiography.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaGeez... Nothing about this embodies the spirit of Bruce Lee.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaShit man, I&#39;m ready.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaShould have been Abbas Alizada. Also looks like making history into an action film. Kind of a shame really considering the wasted potential here.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL7OfxJo2oA&amp;t=2m05s">2:05</a>    YESSS!!!!!!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitai though the fight was 1 sided and that Lee chased the monk around the mat after a few minutes, not this matrix crap.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIm back bitches
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;d kung lao&#39;s hat go
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhelp i&#39;m glad we&#39;re getting another martial arts movie.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThey stay fabricating facts that are known and admitted by those that have witnessed the events. Yet, alone still alive and have given plenty of interviews/testimonies on the life, events, etc of Bruce Lee. I could have sworn his 1st student was Jesse Glover along with others were indeed Asian, black, and white. The cast is completely Caucasian damn near. Why fabricate what can easily be researched and proven? Furthermore never knew Wong Jack Mon was a Shaolin monk/master and was some big famed guy that came from China to challenge Bruce so openly? I have nothing against any race being of mixed heritage/lineage. But, tired of Hollywood etc white washing facts. Like the old west of America. They were all Caucasian let them tell it. No Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians existed then. The Chinese built the railroads, Blacks and Hispanics were primarily what you saw often as cowboys. Along with some Native Americans as well as whites. This movie is an insult to Bruce Lee. As well as his family, student&#39;s, closest friends and legacy. At least Dragon the Bruce Lee story gave a closer insight to the facts that occurred in Lee&#39;s life. Can&#39;t believe this
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaEXPOSISION, THE TRAILER, WWE is not a movie studio, thisa is gonna be trash
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaHidden swastica at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL7OfxJo2oA&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a>! Can you find it?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaMan instead of this go watch The Foreigner starring Jackie Chan cuz that shit looks lit.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis was the story of how Bruce Lee became a vigilante protector of San Francisco? Oh wait, that didn&#39;t happen, just like most of the stuff in this movie.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaLooks like this would be a great movie!!!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawhen is this movie gonna come out?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitahow is this wwe related?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitalooks like a good movie, to bad they put rap crap in it...
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI whoched 5 seconds and I stop just to say this look like a whates of money and this move look fucking dum and retarded
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaOk I don&#39;t give a fuck what there fucking saying about this movie I&#39;m fucking watching it nobody is gonna fucking stop me fuck the haters
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitai seen a lot of bruce lee fakes movies but this one actually interest me. he got the swag attitude
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was supposed to come out in 2016, but the Asian community had an outrage because the movie&#39;s main character was based on Steve McKee, a Caucasian man who met Bruce Lee when he moved to Los Angeles.  Bruce Lee was only a supporting role in the original trailer from last year.  It&#39;s not going to change the concept of how the movie was portrayed, because they only changed it to please the true Bruce Lee fans and for all the Asians who were pissed off when they watched the trailer a year ago.  You can&#39;t make a movie about the greatest martial artist ever without having him as the main character, and to also have the audacity to name the film, &quot;Birth of a Dragon.&quot;
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaTo my knowledge, Bruce has meet this guy just once and the whole fight was more or less like this - The guy was stepping away for a while and Bruce was trying to get him as he was stepping forward to him. Then, after few minutes of walking / slow running around the gym, Bruce did get him and ended the fight. His wife Linda said (she was the only direct witness of this event), that Bruce was kind of a pissed, that it took him so long, but from that day, the Chinese community stopped to threaten him by sending somebody to prove him wrong and his fighting style as weak. Do as much movies you want, but everything sucks ...
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaSleeping dogs?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis pisses me off. Wong runs up a wall and does a flip, Lee does at least two jumping kicks, WHY? Why does a martial arts movie about people who used minimalist technique to maximize damage have to have them doing flashy, unnecessary moves??
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaNow you have begun to exceed your limits! &quot;What limits?&quot; <br>Free your mind! <br>Proceeds to jump off building
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhats next will they start digging stars out of the ground and cgi the skeletons
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI paused as soon as I heard rap. Stop it.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBut can he beat Bruce Wayne?
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIts about time they make a movie on Bruce Lee. SUUUUPER stoked X]
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaasian guys on american movie? fuck yeah
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWait I thought Bruce lee was died
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaLooks dope
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThe bruce lee story movie was the best bruce lee ever made, it was perfect and historically accurate, this here is not.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhat bugs me is the sensationalization of Bruce Lee&#39;s fight with Wong Jack Man. First of the teaching of non Chinese people was an issue but not the only one.  Secondly, it was barely a fight. According to surviving witnesses Bruce landed an early decisive blow and spent much of the rest of the fight chasing Wong Jack Man around the room.  This was hardly some cinematic meeting of equals. The greatest result of the fight was Bruce further refining his technique because he was so angry he couldn&#39;t finish Wong Jack Man more quickly.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaAt least these characters are asian and not white people pretending to be asian
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaYou know the movie is going to be shit when you see WWE studios logo.<br><br>Trailer looks good though 
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fucking retarded...
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaIf you want to see a action-packed Kung Fu movie simply USING the Bruce Lee name, by all means.... Go watch this film.... If you want to see a film ABOUT Bruce Lee, who he actually was and his philosophies; there are FAR BETTER CHOICES!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitalol A white man playing Bruce lol
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaThe One Inch Punch Is Savage
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks amazing
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBased on the trailer It&#39;s going to suck.  Like 99% of the so called BL biographies.<br>Just one point of the many obvious ones:  Who in a fight would run up against a pillar to do a backflip?  Obviously it would be no contest for the real BL even in the early 60&#39;s.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaInspired?? Why rebuild a legend that was already complete?? Bruce Lee deserves better than a movie full of testosterone, hip hop and glorified drama. Treat it like he lived his life... Honest, truthful and with honor.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaBring it!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaGaaaaaaaaarbaaaaaage! This movie is going to be trash. So much fiction, and where did they find Goose Lee? That guy is slower than I am. Produced by a Pro WRESTLING studio? If anybody making Bruce Lee biographical style movies knew ANYTHING about Bruce Lee, they&#39;d know that you don&#39;t have to add fiction to his life story to make it amazing. Flying through the air like Peking Opera an shit. Get OUTTA here with this mess.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitawhy does the movie dress Wong Jack Man up like a Shaolin monk? This movie is already bullshit.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshita<b>Looks awesome</b>
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaWhere is Chuck Norris!
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaNew trailer hides the fact that this movie has a fictional white leading male and puts Bruce Lee as a secondary character. See original trailer.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaUgh. The problem with anybody playing Bruce Lee is they are always less magnetic than the man they are portraying. Few people have the presence that Bruce Lee possessed. And they are never as good a martial artist as Bruce was. Jason Scott Lee did a great job, the best I&#39;ve seen, but he still was not close to Bruce Lee. He was a better actor than Lee, however. Much better.<br><br>This fight was pretty much a nothing fight in real life. It&#39;s when Bruce Lee learned he wasn&#39;t as good as he thought he was, and decided to do something about it. And he did. But the flick is pure, 100% fiction, aside from the fact that the fight DID actually happen.
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m a big fan of Bruce Lee but this movie is a joke.  Bruce&#39;s wife has said he hit the guy once and the guy tried to run away.  He wasn&#39;t some legendary guy that people read about in papers and said &quot;Wong Jack Man is coming to town!&quot; lol
SL7OfxJo2oAdelimeterByIshitaLooks terrible.

cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait for Kat and Matt to interactüòçüòçüòç
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaFrom the trailer Victoria Justice seems like they same exact same way she always acted. Ahe has not emotion. She like the female Nicholas Cage. Matt &amp; Katherine can act w/o a doubt and at the end of the day Justice will be the negative of this film. However, (as I always say) if I am wrong I will be happy 2 admit it so please kind. IDK everything &amp; I don&#39;t have a problem admitting if I am not right.

cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know which song is it playing in the background?
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaReally good to see Lucien get a role after Katy Keene got cancelled. I&#39;m still upset about them killing him off of Scream Queens.
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaShadowhunters looks different here üëÄ
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaVai ser lan√ßado na Netflix ou prime ??
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaOne would think Matt (&#39;s character) learned his lesson the first time he got offered to &quot;stay for a drink&quot;...

cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s going to be released in March
cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaIt looks kind of interesting, but I don&#39;t get why does Matthew play in the movie with the actresses with who he had already played. That&#39;s strange.

cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaMATT!! I can&#39;t wait!!<br>Also, the irony considering his name in the movie is Owen Short (I think) and in reality, he&#39;s like 6&#39;4&quot;

cFYaADDJI6gdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the song&#39;s name?
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blAKCJcXC5c&amp;t=0m58s">0:58</a> I love what he&#39;s wearing.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI read the title as Anthropologie
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie that is not about US &quot;patriots&quot; and &quot;heroism&quot;.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThe guy they have playing Heydrich is a perfect lookalike. <br>Evil looking bastard.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHail Hydra 
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaArnim Zola!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHail Hydra!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t look at Jamie Dornan as a normal person anymore üò≠üò≠
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAnd the codename is August.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good!!!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks to be an outstanding story -- but when is Hollywood going to abandon its love affair with handheld camera work (like, <b>*ALL*</b> the time)??????
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThe guy from peaky blinders!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCillian murphy
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaMr. Grey
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaWhy I got the feeling Dornan will die the half way of the movie?  Just compare the outfits and scenes btw him and Murphy.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCILLIAN MURPHYÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI see that marvel cinematic universe is in here
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaYes another Nazi movie
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitafifty shades of grey action version
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitay is everything r rated

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitawhat is your mission... my mission is to get the mission report of 1969.

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAs a Czech, this makes me very hyped!!! :D
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks very exciting and that may mean something! :)
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThese assassins who did succeeded in killing the Rienard Heydrich cost so many innocent Czech lives. Did Heydrich need to go yes but this operation was a botch job from word go, some estimate that over 10,000 people lost their lives because of such poor planning.I wonder if the movie will go into that?I am not saying it did not need to be done but the operation could have been accomplished with a lot less cost to people who had nothing to do with the plot.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI got a few goosey-bumps watching this...and Cillian rules everything he&#39;s in. &quot;Team Shelby&quot;, even...!   ;)
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this by order of the Peaky Blinders!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCame for the comments only seems like there&#39;s more HYDRA over Mr Grey.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHail hydra??

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCillian Murphy is Seriously underrated
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks awsome
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitared skull is rolling his head in his graves right now....
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThis is Czech ww2 history.

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaTommy fookin&#39; Shelby!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaX Company: The Movie
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCome on, guys. It is based on true events. Actually, this movie is all about true event - assassination on Heydrich, one of the most powerful men in Germany in WW2. It is not just one of 100 more boring WW2 movies, this actually happened, and it is one of the most unknown and even one of the most emotive chapters of WW2.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m really excited to see this film.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaWhat is operation shamalamadingdong? <br><br>We are here to assassinate the world&#39;s worst director before he invades another genre or shits on another beloved franchise.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaMarcin Dorocinski!  &lt;3
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshita50 shades of Nazis
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaZola I thought you were dead OMG PLOT TWIST.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAnother assassination plot that didnt work? Yay, Nazi Germany is such a relevant and creative idea for a movie, never been done before.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHm..I hope the movie is bettter than the trailer. I love Cillian Murphy! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blAKCJcXC5c&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> omg <br>And I also love that guy I&#39;ve seen so many times, but somehow still don&#39;t know the name of at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blAKCJcXC5c&amp;t=1m37s">1:37</a> !
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaEveryone seems to know Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey but he&#39;ll always be Paul Spector to me
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitafinally.... I know why Mr. Grey like the HARD way!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCharlotte le bon üòç
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaSo their boss is a Hydra computer..
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaJAMIE
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaTwo great Irish actors üëèüèº
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitathe fact that Cillian Murphy is in this movie is good enough a reason for me to watch it.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks intense. Problem with WW2 historic films is - we know how long it took to end the Nazis - 50-60M died. They did manage to kill Heydrich, but it didn&#39;t shorten the war. The village where he was ambushed, was wiped from the map by the Nazis.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s captain America??
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitapeaky blinders meets fifty shades ?
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHydra was actually a thing? I thought its just in Marvel stories
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitapeople complain about slave movies but not these...
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitawell they succeed but &quot;SPOILER&quot; <br><br>the villages were they had grown up in were reduced to ash and mud and everyone there was killed
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna watch this for Thomas Shelby Peaky Blinders
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAll I see is Tommy Shelby now
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAnother bloody remake <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075019/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075019/</a>
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it&#39;s worth two hours of my time.

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaChristian Grey is about to burst into action
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a good movie that I won&#39;t probably watch.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaIf we fail, I fear freedom will be wiped from the map. That&#39;s why I pressed dislike. Stop making these stupid slogans guys. Hollywood is such a Hollywood last years it&#39;s not funny anymore.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaAAH IM SO EXCITED
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaJamie Dornan can actually surpise one  as an actor and I think this movie could be good. <br>However, I hope this movie (as the story) will go a little bit beyond the &quot;evil nazi&quot; vs &quot;the good ones&quot; and focus a little bit on how &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; perspectives  often blend into an ugly grey mess.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaFor a moment, I thought the titles was &quot;Android&quot;
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaHail Hydra
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaThis is bullshit. Cillian Murphy is such an actor, but &#39;m tired of ALL THOSE KIND A FILMS. i think that this kind of films, of nazis, are made LIKE  HUNDREDS OR THOUSAND EVERY YEAR.
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaWow, it looks good.  I got the chills.

blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it !!!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitaFirst comment!
blAKCJcXC5cdelimeterByIshitafirst
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshita...PG-13? wtf lol.. lame
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshita...jack reacher... this year.. next December 2013.. jack Ryan
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaThe insane vitriol I&#39;ve seen from Fanboys is incredible. I love Jack Reacher, own all the books, and have been stoked for this since it was announced. Will it be a perfect retelling? Of course not. Will I enjoy it? You betcha.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWell let me start off with I think Cruise can pull it off.  However a good action actor Reachers size is not that hard to find.  Liam Neeson 6 ft 4 in , Dwayne Johnson  6 foot and 4, Matthew Fox 6&#39; 2&quot;, Chris Hemsworth 6‚Äô3, Christian Bale 6&quot;0, Will Smith 6&quot;2, Vin Diesel 6&quot;1  All proven action stars that suit the frame of the charicter and can be devesteing onscreen.   
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaHere is the fact for you Jack Reacher&#39;s fan. Skydance, Tom Curise company, buy this thing copyright and make a movie. Tom as Jack, why not? Because he is the boss. So, if you complaining a lot and make this movie don&#39;t get profit, you never get Jack Reacher again in the movie for a long long time.
Just stop complaining and please make protest or negative comment after this movie get release maybe one month.
I&#39;m not Cruise&#39;s fan, just an audience like good movies.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care about this movie.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitahe plays ethan hunt badass well, but I agree, not at all like reacher.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaActually it&#39;s State Trooper not Super Trooper. Don&#39;t know where the hell I got that from.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaDrop The Lime by Super Trooper. Weird song title I know. Just type in Jack Reacher music 2 and you&#39;ll find it.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaHim playing Jack Reacher, is like Stallone playing tinker bell, sorry not believable at all. He has never come across as a bad ass, stop trying to change your image it won&#39;t work.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaTo bad we dont have any real Jack Reacher&#39;s out there to clean up the trash in America.

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI heard Alexander Rhodes was the lead in this film
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaThe last two clips didn&#39;t make any sense. They were supposed to be funny. But why? Now it&#39;s just awkward because we don&#39;t have any context. No idea why you don&#39;t understand my confusion.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaYou really need to get a life.  
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitabecause it&#39;s so bad?

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaMy favorite writer, my favorite book of his, my least favorite actor.  And I still can&#39;t wait to see it.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaOne Shot.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWell.. massive Reacher fan here. read all the books several times. Like a lot of people i was all &#39;WUT!?&#39; at the casting of cruise as reacher. Then the first trailer came out and i was all &#39;meh&#39; and then the 2nd trailer came out and i was all &#39;SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!&#39; true story
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaThe novel is called One Shot by Lee Child and it&#39;s one of the best out there I reccomend it to anybody
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWhich novel is this based on ?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAlex Rhodes is so good in this movie
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer!  Hope it didn&#39;t give too much away.  Looks fun!  ....on second thought I&#39;d like to see that movie!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitawoW! I like it. 
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaMan.. I&#39;m Speechless
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAssassin&#39;s Creed style 2:03
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLOL...Tommy boy cant act.. Give it up to your spirit in the sky !! DUMBASS

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaNo idea what could confuse you. Remember: it&#39;s a trailer. You&#39;re not supposed to have all the answers. 

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitastepping out of moving car got more awssmm by that CAP EXCHANGE move :)
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI think Cruise will be great, but i think Kiefer Sutherland would have been unbeatable. Or Liam Neeson if you can forgive his hair colour
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaFor those who are interested - The SONG is  &quot;Drop The Lime - State Trooper&quot;
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitahahahahahaha...right?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure how I feel about this. The vibe I get from this trailer is unique but the footage isn&#39;t the greatest. The end confused me and I&#39;m not crazy about Cruise.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaEhh
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshita@TheAwesomerPrime haha
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitacould he at least changed his appearence just a little bit from the &quot;mission impossible look&quot; ?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI personally think that Tom Cruise shouldn&#39;t be playing this role. If you read the books the character is actually the complete opposite.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaDamn, even better than the first trailer, this is why Tom Cruise is a fucking movie star, can&#39;t wait!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathe help he got after ditching the car.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get what&#39;s so hilarious about that though? It&#39;s mildly amusing at best.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitai dont care about all that size garbage. this movie is gonna be awesome no matter what.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWerner Herzog!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLove it!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLOL... the last part was EPIC!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathe last 20 seconds when he just walks out of the car while being chased to the police, into the crowd, and the guy gives him the cap.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitawhat are u talking about?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaCruise could be very impressive in this role. I was buying him as the character.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathey just made the movie
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWhy? Which part of it is funny? Am I missing something?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAnd that&#39;s LMAO-worthy these days? I&#39;ve had funnier STD&#39;s.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaok. I know you are trying to educate me...but. ITS A MOVIE. ANYYHING GOES!.
Could have been MEL GIBSON for all I care...this is about FUN. If the movie is fun that means that I am going to the movies and watch this movie.
I enjoyed Suzzane Collins novels as well but the movie SUCKED!......he!. what are you going to do.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI agree but he doesnt have the stature or look imposing
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitan obecause the crowd reacted in that way and actually decides to blend him in
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitahe&#39;s a good actor but a lunatic in the real world
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaIf they used an actor more akin to the character in the novel, that would have never worked.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAmei! Love it!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaNo its the crowds reaction that makes it funny.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get why people are finding the end of this trailer so funny? Is it because we&#39;re supposed to expect Tom to run away once he gets the hat but instead he waits for the bus? Is that it?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathat last part was just like assassins creed
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshita#YoLo #
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLol at the last scene :)
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaJohn MacClane&#39;s son is in this? Jai&#39;s gonna have a big year
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaget the lawyer! cuz shes hot
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitait is not the joke, its the unecessary lmao e lols and whatever else.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaMorgan fucking Freeman ????
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitadude....everybody gets it except you?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitawhy the lmao? why?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaIt isn&#39;t.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathe hat scene was pretty funny... but where one is suspicious onlooker?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaMix action flavours from MI + Die Hard + Taken + James Bond = The Great Jack Reacher .... Worth watching movie .....
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaOkay, I&#39;m not a huge fan of Tom, but this trailer looks awesome. I will surely watch this movie!!!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaaww Werner Herzog is bad guy :3
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaIs that Morgan Freeman at the end who hands him the cap?...can&#39;t tell if its him or not!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaOk...this trailer was a lot better than the first one. 
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaawesome
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaÊúÄÂæå‰∏ÄÂπïËÆöÔºÅ
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaThe hat-thing is awesome..
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathat last 20sec. was funny looks ok and its tom cruise come on.... and he has to redem himself for knight and day
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI hate when they say someone&#39;s a ghost. They&#39;re always saying that to make the spec-ops guy sound impressive. I&#39;m sick of Casper in my action movies.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitazzz...
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitasometime man wear stretch pants, just for fun... a hero shouldn&#39;t always be the Rock, makes it more closer to reality.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI love the end of this trailer.....
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAfter a long  time great movie trailer ‚ô° it
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLMAO!!!! I dont know ABout the movie, but the last 20 sec of this trailer are GOLD!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitatrailer makes it look good, i hope it is....
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaLee Child didn&#39;t have that much to do with the film, the adaptation was written by Christopher McQuarrie so he&#39;d have had a lot to do with Cruise getting cast. It is without a doubt the worst casting ever.
I think that Josh Holloway (Sawyer from Lost) would be much better.
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaYep thats what alot of money and healthy clean living can produce. 
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathe best part of the film is the last part of this trailer
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaThis is how tom cruise wants to deal with scientology haters!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWow, i&#39;m impressed at how Tom Cruise can be so convincingly menacing.
&#39;Do you think I&#39;m a hero&quot;
/sucks lolipop/ 
&quot;Gaga GooGoo&quot;
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaAwesome soundtrack !!

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitawhen?
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaI am the law!!!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaBadass a little bit younger and with weapons


Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshita2,15 min :DD 
FUCK THE POLICE

Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWhoa,,,,there&#39;s Werner Herzog in a Tom Cruise film!
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitajust cool
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaWell he is 5&#39;6 like 155 on a good day and Jack Reacher is 6&#39;4 like 225 is so thats not a big difference at all. Great choice Lee Child
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitathat last part was awesome :D
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitafinally Tom looks old =/
Q-oxhxD32MMdelimeterByIshitaIs this that new Alexander Rhodes movie?
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaWatched again in 2023 and still funny AF.  üòÇüòÇ
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaPOV: you just looked up what the worst rated movie on netflix was.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaNo matter what they said,i always love to watch Adam Sandler movies... ‚ù§Ô∏è
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaü§†
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaü§û
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaWhy this video doesn‚Äôt have a million views beats me. This was a classic - had me in tears from beginning to end.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was absolutely disgusting!
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaWhy does everyone always hate on Adam Sandler&#39;s movies he&#39;s do good
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer was a terrible representation of what the movie actually was. Trailer makes it look like Adam Sandler plays a serial killer. Soooo not the case. I would have never watched this movie based on this trailer alone‚Ä¶I watched another legitimate trailer that actually represents the real feel of the movie and that is why I watched (and liked) the movie‚Ä¶This trailer is just horribly misleading‚Ä¶
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThe wife looks like Riley reid
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaWhy is the trailer so scary but the movie isn‚Äôt that really... ü§î
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaAdam sandler and David spade omgg
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ1fKYmF4qU&amp;t=00m26s">00:26</a> Mr. Sandler&#39;s voice is the sexiest thing on earth üòÜ
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitawait inspired by true events what
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaAdam Sandler is a good actor man
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaTriiiiiiple hppppp me hicieron dar un strike y la pel√≠cula est√° en muchos canales. Me pelan la munda . M√°s fama es lo que les voy a dar de ahora en adelante . Ya sabe mi gente no paguen por nexflis porque hay plataformas que muestran las pel√≠culas y series gratis. No paguen por lo que est√° gratis en el internet. Pronto les subo la plataforma donde pueden ver todo lo que quieran gratis todos los programas que salen aqu√≠ los podr√≠as ver gratis
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaI really loved this movie. I havent laughed this hard to one of his movies in so long.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitafor the record at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ1fKYmF4qU&amp;t=0m59s">0:59</a> getting your tounge prieces is not nearly as scary or painful in real life.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaI guess waterboy snapped....I think his megula obleggatta wasn&#39;t working momma says
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitainteresting seeing Adam Sandler as a crazy murder.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitathe dude is freaking crazy
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis was good
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaHow many times are you going re-release this trailer? Tracking that bad, eh?
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThey mad this shit look like a horror movie xD
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaI loved this movie
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was actually pretty good.. dunno if it was because I had low expectations but either way I had a laugh!
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitathey&#39;re not gonna laugh at you sandler
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was hilarious!!!
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaIts not a horror at all lol Its typical adam sandler aka funny and crude.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitathis is so not the same mood as the movie i like it
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitabro i wouldnt mind a horror film with adam sandler in it xD
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s sad when you make a trailer that&#39;s more entertaining than the movie
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaHahaha I actually liked this trailer. I like a studio who can play with their own material like this.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis is a good movie.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitathis would of been a better movie.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaYou know, this looks a lot better than most of Sandler&#39;s normal stuff.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitalol they make it look like a horrer movie, I saw it on Netflix a while ago and it&#39;s really funny
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThey should &quot;do-over&quot; the decision of making all these Adam Sandler movies
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaYou guys are making it seem by a scary movie haha that&#39;s pretty cool<br><br>But anyone that hasn&#39;t seen it<br><br>It&#39;s a comedy, a okay one
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaI liked it, was decent
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was a bit funny but the jokes were too much. Sandler is getting old but come on dude i know you can do better, work with Seth Rogen he&#39;s another hilarious Jew x)
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis is probably the best thing Adam has done in years.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaI want to see Adam Sandler play a legit horror movie villain. He sure is terrifying enough.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitahahahah
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitahahahah
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitathe movie was funny stop with your cancerous unfunny jokes plz thnx
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaCan people please stop giving Adam sandler money!!
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitalol! Funny trailer... Good movie too... Hatters gona hate
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaSeen this on putlocker, it&#39;s a 7/10 tbh
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie wasn&#39;t too bad, far superior to Ridiculous 6.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaNetflix stop...Everybody hates Adam Sandler
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaow ffs Netflix stop giving Adam Sandler money
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaHaha awesome job with this trailer. Looks like it can actually be a dark scary movie.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaIs this a comedy or horror ? ??? I can&#39;t tell.
lZ1fKYmF4qUdelimeterByIshitaSo early
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaquestionalble lead actress, but w/e

bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYep, I&#39;m going to see it. 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYYYOOOOO this movie seems so good
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLimitless 2: slow progression
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaDo you speak english?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaDo you speak english?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI like how people get so mad over a MOVIE just let it go
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI like how people get so mad over a MOVIE just let it go
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer looks pretty shitty but the movie seems interesting
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWhat kind of bullshit is this??? &quot;Universal Pictures will distribute the movie worldwide, except for France, Benelux and China.&quot;¬†<br>fucking assholes. Then you wonder why people use torrents?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI feel like my name is overused in movies...
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaSo you <br>accessing more brain power = god like powers <br>Seems legit 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaSo....limitless on drugs?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI wana watch this now
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitanot only Limitless, also nuances of Alice from Resident Evil...
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLive-action Elfen Lied? Sort of?¬† Idk.¬† Lucy is... lucy, after all.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLimitless meets the Martix, with Scarlet.....take all my money!!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWow
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaSeems interesting
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYou don&#39;t need to watch the movie if you don&#39;t like the trailer. Stop being negative..
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitawicked cool¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaChoi Min Sik?!? <b>Hyperventilates</b> this is gonna be one Awesome film!!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI want to use 100% of my brain to think! Why the fuck would I need things like memories, motor skills and eyesight?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaIdiots... What is being said is about potential... We obviously use the entirety of our brain systematically, however, we don&#39;t actually tap into the actual capacity of it... The common man can learn up to six languages without issues and as his I.Q. Increases so does the ability to acquire more knowledge... How many languages does the average person know..? Exactly
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaOhhhkay now this is just ridiculous.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshita...This shit again?Why do we need another Limitless movie?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI INSTANTLY thought of Elfen Lied (which is my favorite anime &lt;3).
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaScarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman. I just <b>mind blown</b>
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaBitch, if everyone that used 30% of their brain could do that, we would have a ton of Lucies.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaSoooooo...its basically Limitless,with a female protagonist?<br><br><br>....And magic.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI smell an elfin lied movie coming soon 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaTaipei??? Why did they make Taipei look like TOKYO !!??¬†<br>The Mob even have dragon tattoos like the Yakuza...who are in Japan not Taiwan!!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m starting to hate this movie because it is the AD for every single video i watch!!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYeah watching this
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWhy are people so upset about the 10% thing? Morgan Freeman said estimated he didn&#39;t say it was a fact its all theory and at least if its not &quot;sound&quot; its still theory none the less so error is allowed. Besides that I&#39;m kinda ready to see this movie seems like it&#39;ll have some great action/visuals if nothing else.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThis summer... Morgan freeman
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaFemale version of limitless ?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait to watch this.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaMorgin free mane
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaMrein femin in the move
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaAnd I want to see this movie so bad
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLol drugs = powerful. :P she just got bad***
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYou had me at Scarlett Johansson.  I&#39;ve heard that humans only use 10% at any one time, 100% use would probably have impressive results, but also some bad side effects. Like overclocking your CPU but not upgrading your fan to cope with the extra heat, your brain wouldn&#39;t do so well long term.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWe only use 10% of our brain is a myth. Though Hollywood seems to like using it in their films. In actuality we use all parts of our brain. ¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaNO NO NO NO! Stop with this &quot;10% of your brain&quot; bullshit! FFS PEOPLE! It&#39;s 2014 not 1958! I&#39;m sick of this shit.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshita10%? Hahaha I guess you guys haven&#39;t discover it, yet.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaSo no one has made the I Love Lucy joke yet? No? Well, here you go.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI know our brain is awesome, but wtf is this? this is god?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWell this doesn&#39;t look fucking stupid at all
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLimitless rip off much?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI think the reason why we never reach 100% or stay at 10% brain power is because if we reach the 100% mark that&#39;s when we lose our humanity we wont be able to think with emotion anymore
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaA lot of half-assed attempts at delving into transhumanist and posthumanist themes lately. Disappointed to see nearly all go for the cheesy route of action as opposed to the internal character drama of losing all reference to human culture, biology, and so on.<br><br>I would watch 10 times a movie where a character actually has to go over the issues of becoming a posthuman god as opposed to where the struggle is entirely physical and they seem fine with it for all but 2 scenes.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLucy, it&#39;s one hell of a drug.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaUm. Dang.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaElfen Lied?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThere was a Bradley Cooper movie with thus same premises that what happens if you use 100% of your brain
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWow good for Scarlet Johanson she&#39;s got three movies coming out this year.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitasome heroes shit going on! lol want to see this.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaBlack Widow Origins
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaTAIPEI!!!!!!!!!!!<br>lol<br>great move<br>SOOO WANNA C IT!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThis is limitless on steroids
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaMaybe.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaregardless of everyone&#39;s negative criticism, I think this movie will be awesome!¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaDid this movie make MORGAN FREEMAN of all people say that &quot;10% of brain&quot; bullshit?! People who believe that probably only use 10% of their brain. This makes me mad.¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitatheres is no spoon neo....matrix fan here so im surely gonna watch this
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaYa quiero verla!!! 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaEch, I was so on the ball with this until they brought up that stupid 10% bs.¬† I&#39;m hoping the trailer is just misrepresenting it because they think people are stupid (sorry, they aren&#39;t that stupid; this isn&#39;t some super sciency knowledge, you&#39;d know this was wrong if you even just went to a State Fair and watched Weird Al&#39;s Brain)
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLimitless...
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaBlack widows new power!!! haha if only, but looks good, i wanna see this!¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaFirst off this is a rip off of Limitless, and second that whole 10% of your brain thing, is 100% bull crap. You DO use 100% of your brain, but not all of it is for thinking, rather controlling your heart, hunger, and nerve endings. 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWhen is this misconception that we only use 10% of our brains going to end already? lol I thought that died with the 80s. Though the &#39;IF&#39; of the idea is still intriguing, and who didn&#39;t like Limitless, good movie.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshita....furthermore although we have made great leaps in learning about the human brain there is still much to be learned &amp; we our long way from unlocking all that the human brain can do!!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThe thing about only being able to use 10% of the brain is a common misconception - people have twisted the original research, originally it was said that at 1 time we can only use 10% of our mental capacity - we use our whole brain just 10% at any 1 given time. 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaHaven&#39;t we already beaten this silly misconception to death already?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaIf she was using 100% of her brain shed realize that 10 percent of that brain theory is bullshit. 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshita&#39;&#39;it is estimated that most human beings only use 10% of the brains capacity&#39;&#39;¬† That is such an ancient, dumb misconception that I can&#39;t believe anybody is still repeating that shit. Most people use most¬†of their brains. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percent.asp">http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percent.asp</a>
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaBecause they casted Choi Min-sik  as the villain, it&#39;s now a must see. 
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaBro, Do you even Limitless?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaŸàÿ¨ÿßŸÑŸÉ ŸÇŸÑÿ® ÿ™ÿ±ŸÅÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿØÿ≥ ŸÅŸä Ÿàÿ¥Ÿáÿß Ÿäÿß ÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿà! :D
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaRIPOFF
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaNeo it&#39;s you ? ^_^
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaRewatching the trailer I half expected a Sharingan to pop up at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN7ksFEVO9U&amp;t=0m39s">0:39</a>
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitait is like limitless but it still looks really friggin cool
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitalol a movie about a common misconception where the plot is ripped right out of another movie thats not even 5 years old.¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWow that looks incredible. I hope they can bring such a premise to life with an interesting story, I look forward to seeing it.¬†
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome !!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaEPICALLY COOL doesn&#39;t even begin to describe: LUCY!
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI will want to see this only because the idea that&#39;s behind it.
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaAm I the only one who thought at 1st it was a remake a Nikita when it played as an ad?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaLimitless much?
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this so bad
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaWow
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitalimitless...
bN7ksFEVO9UdelimeterByIshitaHoly fucking shit this looks awesome
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaCynthia is perfect in the role. I love this actress.<br>The great Emily Dickinson deserved such a tribute.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaBeautiful movie
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaCynthia Nixon sitting near a table and writing is cinematic by itself.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaWhy Emily love relationship with Susan doesn&#39;t exist here? I was dissapointed
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI hate this movie.... WATCH Dickinson or Wild Nights with Emily.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaThe interpretation of Cynthia Nixon is simply perfect, exceptional, in her Emily Dickinson seems to come to life. It is extraordinary! A really very nice film for the setting for the plot for the drafting and for the language.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI had never cried as much as when Emily Dickinson and her sister&#39;s mother died beside them on her bed.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaThis movie has the most tenuous connection with any historical context, told through the narrow minded filter of 21st century Hollywood.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaHow can I get this film in Canada? Anyone?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaWhat are the piano song used as background music
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI‚Äôm gonna need a little more gay from anyone aiming for an accurate portrayal of Emily. Anyone that‚Äôs read her letters knows what was up between her and her brothers wife üëÄ
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshita<b>This movie is homophobic. They totally straightwashed Emily Dickinson.</b>
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitalooks like a chick flick
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaJust watched it on Netflix. A truly beautiful movie. I will definetly watch it again.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI still need to see this movie. So grateful Emily is getting increased attention lately - inspiring new people all the time!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaIs this movie out yet ,please does anyone know ? Thank you .
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaMaestros somos en lo<br>Que hacemos y lo que <br>Hacemos no sabemos<br>Porque no <br>Entendemos . <br>&quot; soy nadie &quot;
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaThis music unbearable.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaMaybe it‚Äôs just this trailer but this movie looks awful

eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI just saw it today and was floored! Laughed in the beginning and cried at the end, an unforgettable emotional tour de force! I am so going to see it again! And buy the movie too. Stunning. And...it made me feel sorry, not just for Emily but for a lot of women who had to endure such times.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaSorry that&#39;s incorrect
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaname of song The Deep Blue Sea
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s been months. Has anyone found out about the trailers music?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaToo bad it&#39;s Cynthia Nixon otherwise I&#39;d watch it.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaWhat song is this?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshita<b>A Quiet Passion (2017) ‚ñ∫</b> <a href="https://plus.google.com/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/gASCx9HrxSp">https://plus.google.com/+InfinityMoviesEntertainment/posts/gASCx9HrxSp</a>
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitathe music is a bit much
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaJennifer is here allright, but where is Emma and Hugh, if I may dare to ask? Hoopledidoo.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI also worked on this film and you can see my arm holding an umbrella for Joanna Bacon. A friend of mine who lives in Edinburgh has already seen the poster up in theaters so I assume the UK release is before the US release, which is the 14th of April. Can&#39;t wait to see it!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaTime - Geoffroy Berlioz
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaWell, I am quietly dissapointed with this choice... Cyntie does even looks nearly like Emilly... Emilly looked prettier than she.... Here, she look very old... And she does not have that mysterious charisma that Emilly had trougout her all life...
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaLove Emily Dickinson..Sadly though being a good actress, I just don&#39;t think Cynthia Nixon is the right fit to portray her.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaNice to see Cynthia getting a good role for once, last time I remember was Amadeus in &#39;83.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaThe soundtrack ruined the trailer, in my opinion. I also find hard to associate Emily to one of the actresses of &quot;Sex in the City&quot;. Still, in Davies I trust. Looking forward to this.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitawhat name song ?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaThis article in the Hollywood Reporter says that it should be released in the USA in the first quarter of 2017. <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cynthia-nixons-emily-dickinson-biopic-928786">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cynthia-nixons-emily-dickinson-biopic-928786</a>  Why can&#39;t they be any more specific than that? Sometime between now and five months from now? Come on, give me something more than this. I&#39;ve watched this trailer 50,000 times already. Give me the movie!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI must see this.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaWhat song is this?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI worked on this film. A marvelous time.. Terrence Davies couldn&#39;t have been nicer to us.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaAy, est√° bien padre cuando rompe el plato, ¬øno?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know when the film will be officially released to watch online?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaSooo excited to see this film. I have been hoping for several years now that someone would make a film about Emily Dickinson, because she was such an interesting person. She is truly one of the great minds of our history. It&#39;s like she could see what so many around her could not. In a world where she was invisible, and a mere crumb she lived within herself. I am so glad Terence is the director because I don&#39;t think many people could capture Dickinson&#39;s essence the way he can. I can tell Cynthia Nixon will do a great job playing her. I&#39;m excited to see the actor playing her in her younger days as well.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitashe&#39;s a brilliant actress. Last year she shold have won an Oscar for the criminally underrated James White...looking forward to see this movie.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaPlease, anyone knows the name of the song in the trailer?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaIf you enjoy this movie or interested in Emily Dickinson, please read her letters that are equally stunning. She wrote thousands. They are online.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI am a fan of Emily for years. The Trailer here shows Emily breaking the plate at the table due to the father complaining about getting the same chipped plate set before him. Emily breaks the plate here but, in truth Emily took the plate out by the barn and broke it over a rock. Would be nice if movies stuck to the truths. Looking forward to the movie though
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI just LOVE Cynthia! She&#39;s a GreatT Actress!!!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI am very excited to see this film! Emily Dickinson&#39;s work and life have long fascinated me, both as a human being and a writer. So glad her story is finally being told on the big screen.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaCynthia Nixon is phenomenal.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaBeautiful, beautiful trailer for a hopefully beautiful movie. The music was too loud tho.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaI hope a distributor picks it up for the US. I want to see this terribly!
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaAnyone know the music?
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitaSaw this a week ago at the NZIFF. A brilliant film. Loved it.
eKJpx8FYp54delimeterByIshitawant to watch this.

KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita&quot;I always thought that pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more special. Judy Blume should have prepared me for that.&quot; XD
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaLooks pretty good!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@TharaKhale well I just keep learning something new now don&#39;t I? XDDD
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitareally want to see this
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@Axxidous Degrassi is a show from Canada.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaOMG i didnt even recognize amanda bynes til they said her name hahaha
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaFinally, a movie worth seeing.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaiam pretty sure Amanda Bynes looks like that just for the role she is playing. i doubt she would look like that for real in person.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitai LOVE amanda in here... i love her make up, make her look like those snotty bitch. and emma really look like lindsey back when she was still hot and innocent.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness It depends on if they can handle only being able to film the minor on set for less than 7 - 9 hours a day or not. lol Dev Patel (from SKINS) is playing as Zuko in The Last Airbender. In that film, I beleive so far only Sokka is playing out of his age as he&#39;s suppose to be 16 and is being played by Jackson Rathbone. But Zuko is actually 17.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness Considering SKINS is from another country, I don&#39;t really have the knowledge on that situation but I can guess that this might mean their laws are different. But then agian, SKINS is also a tv show and though a lot of TV shows also use young adults as teens, they don&#39;t always do this. In America there&#39;s a show called Degrassi that used teens playing as teens as they grew up.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitalmao i know a girl they call easy g
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness I know. There was an article about it once even. I mean look at the show One Tree Hill. Look at the film Transformers! That guy was in the 11th grade when he met Optimus Prime. There is no way I looked that old when I was in the 11th grade and I STILL don&#39;t look that old... BUT that&#39;s how the world looks in the movies. lol :P
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitathis looks funny lolz
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness I assume you didn&#39;t quite understand what I said earlier. You asked why they all look 20+. The reason is cuz it&#39;s a movie. In films and TV shows older teens are played by young adults because they&#39;re more available and easier to work with, especially with the child labor law. While younger teens and kids are generally played by those younger than the age they&#39;re portraying I ASSUME cuz they wont hit puberty anytime soon.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness you&#39;re right. But thankfully it&#39;s merely the reason and not an excuse. ^_^
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaman.....Amanda Bynes face looks so puffy...
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaSTUPID BUT HILIAROUS
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@blackice1022 Well, she seems to be diverse in what little sh&#39;es done so far... guess that just starts off a good rep for her huh? lol
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@lollipopyumness because it&#39;s a MOVIE?
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitamy new must see for the summer.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaI love Patricia Clarkson!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaEmma Stone!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita&quot;Are you ready for the grand finale?&quot; LOL
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaWTF happened to Amanda BYnes. BLonde and shit. ugh!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitajudy bloom didnt prepare any of us lol
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitagay
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitais that Amanda Bynes?? woww  she looks so different now
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitathis moie seems awesome
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitait looks like its goning to be a good movie
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitai have to read the scarlet letter for schoo this summer and i think that this movie is going to make me understand it better.. hopefully.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita@cell718     PEACE AND LOVE!!!!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitawomans body is hers to do with as she sees fit.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaFRIG this movie looks awesome! I can&#39;t wait to see this!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really awesome!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaLol. All-star cast.
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaI wonder what would&#39;ve happened if someone in a major role didn&#39;t have an A in their name :P
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitahells yea
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshita&quot;I fake rocked your world&quot; LOL!
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitawhen does this come out??????????????
KNbPnqyvItkdelimeterByIshitaAmanda Bynes could be mean and judgmental to me all day
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitai watched it yesterday in the cinema and its d e f i n i t e l y worth watching it. thumbs up
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI thought this was very similar to the setup of Shutter Island, with respect to the twists and all, and I found Shutter Island to be much much better. The critics think this is better, but I think they take into consideration what has been done already, and the &quot;originality&quot; of the movie. But without a doubt, I loved Shutter Island and this movie was only somewhat good. This is my initial reaction, because I actually just got done watching Ghost Writer.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaaww.  when i read ghost writer i thought it was going to be based on that tv show i watched in the 90&#39;s with those kids.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitathat was one of the worst movies i have ever seen.  never have i tried to fall asleep in a movie theatre.

if you want something exciting, that isn&#39;t jumbled up and has a good ending, do not watch this film.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaGreat movie!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaAdored the book, can&#39;t wait to see the movie! =D
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitalooks interestin
where can i get the whole book? does someone know?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitafantastic movie
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitafantastic movie
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@martingg3667 
I saw it in a theater right here in Georgia.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@BlakByte well, he&#39;s orgin was a polish jew, so call him as you want to
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaboring trailer
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitawatched this yesterday! amazing!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaewan mcgregor is amazingggg&lt;33
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@BlakByte not jewish. Polish. what a shame of you
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitagreat movie, i didn&#39;t totally understand the ending but it was so well done! polanski is a genius
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitawatched it today and it was really good.....5/5
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaIts pretty mind blowing...once you get it...
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaNot only that but Ewan McGregor..(of course) AND Kim Cattrall are superb. Go see it... really wonderful film!!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitai didn&#39;t see the movie yet,but i&#39;m sure that:
polanski+brosnan=great movie!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaSaw the movie yesterday, I think it&#39;s brilliant!
Beautifully done !
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaWee! :3 Some of this movie is filmed in my hometown. :3
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaNo eye for an eye.  But how about jail?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaAnd why do you think he didn&#39;t rape the 13 y.o. girl?  The rape is not a question.  It&#39;s a fact.

What the lunatics are arguing is that he should not be arrested because it was a long time at and that he is talented.  That&#39;s their whole argument
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI went to see this movie.  Good movie, but then I realized it was directed by CHILD RAPIST ROMAN POLANSKI!

I want my $10 back.  I don&#39;t want  a single of my pennies to go to that pedophile.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaWow.  I see support for the child rapist is alive and well here.

I don&#39;t care how talented Roman Polanski is, he&#39;s still a child rapist and fugitive from the law.  You people would be raving over and supporting Adolph Hitler if the man had been a movie director instead of a painter.

Yes, I realize Roman Polanski was held in one of Hitler&#39;s concentration camps, which is why I find it so ironic that the man is so sanguine about being such a monster and scoff-law himself.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaha I just saw this on a whim and didn&#39;t see a trailer or anything.  it was a good film!  glad I did that.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was very well done, &amp; interesting..but i was waiting for a climactic ending that never came...such a shame. Id give it 8/10
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaFrom the movie, we can clearly make out that its from a novel. A very interesting one,
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve seen it and found it good even though I felt a bit left outside the film. More than the story, I especially liked the direction, which is quite impressive.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaroger ebert gave its a 4 star review! looks good
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t figure it out... Looks interesting!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI find his extradition to be sentenced for a 30 year old crime and the release of this film to be quite the coincidence. Pervert? Yes, but it didnt seem to bother anyone until now.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaSame here, I don&#39;t really understand at all. Guess I&#39;ll have to read the book to find out haha
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaHe is veeeeeeeeeeeeery atractive...:))))))))))
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI agree.... :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaLOL. This is such a good warning against ghost writing.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaGAY...
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI take it you&#39;re the i need stupid story with action ... generation, right!!!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitayou tell him Fimbultyr,  its so ignorant to just  want someone dead its stupid and its counter productive.. and the guys a complete moronic hypocrite.. its like look in the mirror. 

i hope hell exist so lantyjarvis can go to it and meet Polanski.... for wishing someone dead

he probably wasn&#39;t even alive when the shit happened and that makes his opinion on the matter completely void. 

in my book lanty just committed murder...
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaGreat film !
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@identyfikator87 you do realize that this is a limited release movie, and not everybody has access to seeing it at their theatre
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaOLIVIA WILLIAMS ROCKS!!!!!!!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI really want to see this movie!  anyone know a site where I can watch it without having to take a stupid survey first?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaYou&#39;re a fucking idiot. Humans make mistakes, even you. Sometimes their mistakes are grave. But no one has the competence to judge over death and life. If you&#39;re according to justice - Justice is not &quot;eye for an eye&quot;. THIS is just stupidity.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitamy buffer stream froze at :50 and obi-wan&#39;s eyes look funny. O_O Lol
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaKim Cattrall a Great Actress and Very Under-rated, I have seen her in the West End Theatre in London in &quot;Who&#39;s Life is it Anyway&quot; and this week in &quot;Private Lives&quot; She is a 1st Class Theatre Actress with a massive acting range!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaDamn this looks really good. Not often I get goose bumps over an up and coming film!  Cannot wait!!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaHe got in trouble over having sex with an underage girl in the late 70&#39;s.  He did a runner before being officially charged and has been living abroad to avoid being arrested. He&#39;s a wonderful director - but great or not - you have to face the music eventually.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaWell, then, I hope that her character doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s fooling anyone with that accent! o_0
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaEhh, looks like KAKA.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaKim Cattrall accent fail. ;)
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI thought Roman Polanski was in prison or something lol..
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie looks amazing.

Look for quality and story people. That&#39;s what this movie is about. This is not a fucking Transformers movie.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaHarold Smiley Davis
 This reminds me of an old TV episode of &quot;One Step Beyond!&quot;
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaits not at \filmssorcedotcom/ any other suggestion?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitathats a good one...must watch!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaBorn there, raised majority of her life in Canada.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaActually though Catrall was born in the U.K. her family did move to Canada when she was 3 months old and grew up there.  So yeah she is faking the accent of her birth country..
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s brilliant i just came home from watching it...
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitahmmmm dunno about this one.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitahahaha.. that made me laugh.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThis is a GREAT movie.
Say what you want about Polanski, but the bastard knows directing.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitasamantha jones?! lol, nice!
&amp;&amp; EWAN MCGREGOR &lt;3
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaHahaha yeah.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThe perfect movie :)
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaVery nice, lots of BMW¬¥s in the movie
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitatotally agree.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaOMG it&#39;s Obi Wan Kenobi and James Bond!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaNo, she&#39;s not.  She was born in England.  Maybe she&#39;s faking the regional accent.  I don&#39;t know English accents but maybe she&#39;s doing a southern one.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaKim Cattrall was born in England, so in &quot;Sex&quot; she fakes an American accent.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaLooks good. Bond meets Obi-Wan!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaDam this looks so good. pierce brosnan never fails to disappoint =D
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaPierce Brosnan still looks great.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaIt looks great, but they&#39;re talking too damn silently. I can&#39;t tell what they&#39;re saying half the time. Does anyone else have this issue?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaPolanski
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaWer will einen Film eines Vergewaltigers sehen?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaNoooo... zapowiada siƒô nie≈∫le. Panie Pola≈Ñski, szacunek! (Kolejny raz zresztƒÖ, bo czƒô≈õƒá Pa≈Ñskich film√≥w znam na pamiƒôƒá i uwielbiam)
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaKim Cattral is English originally, the accent wouldn&#39;t have been that out of whack for her
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaWhat is Kim Cattral doing in a serious movie??
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaMim Cattral with a briish accent? Oh My.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaBrawo Romek super film !!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@justinthx1138 It 30 years ago. Get over it boyo!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitabeach scenes were filmed near the polish/ german border in germany ... actually very near my town. here you can check that house that was build on the beach just for the movie purpose. watch?v=21fOXFwnzMw
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaewan mcgregor films are always awesome, also pierce brosnans&#39;
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitano i do! lol but i don&#39;t find this trailer really amazing... :s
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaguess it would be more thriller than action movie. im looking forward for an atmosphere like in chinatown, frantic or the tenant movies! hope for a great music

although the story seems to be predictable, im sure polanski made it as black, gloomy and creepy as possible

chinatowns plot seems predictable too, but the way its directed, its atmosphere and great actors make the movie unusual
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitameh
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@rambaldioo Smart, complex stories must not be your thing.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitalove the cast, but the story seems boring.... :s
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitalooks good but that trailer made me feel as if i just watched the entire film.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThe main person, hes an awesome actor
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaPierce Brosnan and Tom Wilkinson are in it and I&#39;ve began to become a fan of Ewan as well so the cast is decent. This looks like it will be a brilliant adaption. I&#39;ll be at the theater for this one.
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaintense lol
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshita@TheRedInferno lmao are you talking about Sex and the City?
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaI &#39;m going to see it 10/10
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks gooodddd!!!!
L_AerBW0EcIdelimeterByIshitalol
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@ironjavs posta? o no sera el mismo papel con otro actor??
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitalooks like some people are split.  its still going to be a great movie so excited 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@sagard03 A pesar de que en el titulo lleva el nombre de Bourne, esta no se trata de el, si no de otro agente que fue sometido al mismo programa que Jason Bourne
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaholy shit this looks amazing
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@AlfieGadsbyKane damon is still bourne? LOL U DUMB?
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitano puede existir otra pel√≠cula de bourne sin el verdadero bourne ( matt damon) el es el √∫nico y el mejor 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaYA ME CAGE EN LOS CALZONES
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@terrorcosmico It explains in the trailer. Please watch it before commenting.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@terrorcosmico He will be back just watch this one and be happy
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@terrorcosmico different chapter new person bourne will be back later
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@Pur3badboi watch it first
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaese no es jason burne...? pero nimodo habra que verla
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI like how the safe house trailer comes before this lol But yeah eventually Matt will be back. I love this Jeremy was the right actor to pick or Mark walberg if you have seen the shooter but I can wait to see this. 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitahopefully him and matt damon team up or something...........now that would be AWESOME!!!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitabuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitai dont care if this is a &quot;new chapter&quot; without matt damon this film can suck it!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaWelcome Aaron Cross to The Bourne Legacy! XD
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaYES!! No more shaky camera!!! I can actually WATCH the action
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaonce i relized jRenner is Not matt damon&#39;s replacement, it became a must-see. welcome to the program...
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitai dont think ppl watch the trailers. they just prepare to BITCH when they complain. The guys name wasnt even the same so how are you going to get mad?
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaMETH POWERS ACTIVATE!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaThis will look terrible without matt. What do they think its the 90s when you could do a sequel without the main actor. Speed 2 anyone.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaDon&#39;t get me wrong, this seems to be great as well. But without Matt isn&#39;t the same, he&#39;s just the soul of the triology!!

Bourne series forever.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI love that:) Matt was great but also this seems owesome:D

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitagoosebumps... just plain goosebumps.. ..
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@AlfieGadsbyKane thank you for pointing this out. People just jump to conclusions and bash a movie they know nothing about
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@maujo2009 im pretty sure he will be in this
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaFINAL INCEPTION LETTERS!!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@iiZGriZzly that guy is old

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaA cameo of Matt Damon in this movie would be priceless!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitayou guys know that Matt Damon will be coming back right? this is just a different chapter in the story. plus, Edward Norton is in it... so im watching it.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitathats pretty neat
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaMatt damon is to old.. this guy will rock the stage!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaGuys it&#39;s not a remake, Damon is still Bourne, this is about another person entirely and it looks great!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaGOD so much better! and better actor!!!
cant wait!!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitathats guys face on the thumbnail fucking cracked me up
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@LeozinhowCM true that
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaHope this movie is good. Music kicks a**. Dont fail me, Hollywood
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaJust isn&#39;t the same without Matt Damon!! :( Can&#39;t even imagine Bourne being someone else

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitanot going to the movies as it isn&#39;t matt damon.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaNew Jason Born??????WTF!!Where is Matt???
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI WANT MATT DAMON BACK! NO HOMO!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@sdgundam37 It&#39;s Not A Remake, Do Some Research, It Is A Continuation, And If You Missed It, You Can Here Them Say. &quot;Bourne Was Just The Tip Of The Ice Berg&quot; A Remake Would Mean They Are Starting Over By Re Making It
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaat last my prayers were spoken!!! not completely ...its not Jason bourne after all!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitahard fkn core!!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitathis looks bad
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI wish Jeremy Renner was my boyfriend. 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaWorried about lack of Jason, but this looks very good. Renner and Norton for the win.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaThat film have Norton!!!I LOVE HIM
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaIll leave it until I actually see it buttttt I remain skeptical. 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitajesus, this soundtrack again...

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@blewidescorpio its a remake of the same series, either way this is gunna be a goddamn joke
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@TheNanoArcher remake of the same series
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaPromising!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaClicked like before the trailer started :D
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@sdgundam37 Dude. Do your research. It is not a remake. Just another chapter on a different &#39;agent&#39;. 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaWhy Is Everybody So Surprised?? It Was Announced A Long Time Ago That Matt Wasn&#39;t Going To Be In This Movie
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitathe bourne movies have been some of the only movies i have actually enjoyed watching through and through in these recent years. i did not agree with another bourne movie being made. but since they did....
HOLLYWOOD! YOU BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP FOR ME!! 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI thought it was a prequel. But a new Bourne is just as good. Hopefully better. If Jason and the new Bourne meet up, of which I&#39;m more than sure they will, that would be epic. Even more so if they fight or work together or both.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@sdgundam37 its not a remake 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitawhat the hell is up with these remakes with new actors... first spiderman now the bourne series? have you no respect for tradition?
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaEdward Norton. It&#39;s gotta be good.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaAm i the only one now whos going to place a nail in a fire-extinguisher and shoot it at someone??? :P
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitawish ed norton was playing the lead
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaso ... Are they telling us that Matt Damos&#39;s Bourne is a Pussy compared to Jeremy Rener&#39;s? .... mehhhh ....
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaTotally seeing this. Jeremy is a great actor! :D
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@OoProVeNoO Jeremy Renner is actually a really good actor, he&#39;s usually in movies with action involving weapons (He is more athletic than Damon), He&#39;s gonna be Hawkeye in the Avengers movie.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaLOOKS GREAT!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaTbh the Bourne series are the only films by Matt Damon&#39;s i really enjoyed. ocean 11 was good his performance wasn&#39;t, departed was good too, not too much to do with his part. Just my opinion.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitawhere is Matt Damon? he is Jason Bourne, i can¬¥t believe he is not in this movie; at least Paul Greengrass is the director?; its a shame that Damon isn¬¥t in this movie; well at leat Edward Norton is , he is awesome
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gonna sound weird but if it wasn&#39;t Jeremy Renner in this movie I wouldn&#39;t be as confident of it living up to the title, but this looks awesome. This year is shaping up to be incredible for movies xD
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@matrixyoda Looks like Jeremy Renner actually

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaawesome  but not matt damon this movie  amazing
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitalooks awesome. and from what the producers say this us a parallel story. That means i can expect matt damon to show u in sequels! Woohoo!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaOnde est√° o MATT DAMON??????????? Where is the MATT DAMON????? I&#39;m not interested movie.... N√£o estou interessado filme.....

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@LeozinhowCM he&#39;s not supposed to be you fool.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita@matthiasck so why did not make another movie with another name? 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaI dislike this because there is no MATT DAMON.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaOK JEREMY RENNER IS GOOD. BUT HE IS NOT MATT DAMON!
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitabullshit... a bourne movie without matt damon is like tripple xXx without vin diesel... and you all know ice cube sucked
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Look what they make you give....&quot;
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita - Sir Inception Horn, meet Mr Bourne Trailer
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaMann Jeremy sounds so much like Matt Damon. For a second,I got all excited that they decided to cast him in the movie as well. 
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshita&quot;who the hell is he&quot; that what i would ike to know, never seen him before so i will pass
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitawho&#39;s matt damon? this looks BADASS!

jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaJeremy Renner + Nortan = Jizz in pants.
jSzy9qQ3mDEdelimeterByIshitaOne of the Bad-ass movies of all time &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;

bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitalol screw the critics this is an awesome movie!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaOne of the whitest movies ever made
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaFavourite movie!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaRichard Coyle üòç
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaWhat a film!!!!! 10/10 i want to meet a Fanny C  and move to France
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitai know thousands of movies, pretty much watch one everyday. not many movies have the ability to stick with me for a few days. this one literally makes me appreciate the small things in life. a man that sacrificed his big career because he finally understood what life is about. as i get older (only 27 at the moment) i fall in love with such stories more and more. i love every single thing about this movie. its a shame that most probably russell crowe or ridley scott would not be up to shoot something like this nowadays. this is pretty much a hidden treasure, i do not remember this being very famous when it was released. i love russell crowe for this. what an actor. as if it really happened to him.
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaWhy cant all movies be as good as this? Probably because the majority of actors are not as good as these. Love it to bits! And what about archie p? What a dish!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaEvery year that I watch this movie becomes A Good Year üíú Love love love this movie üíúüíã so appreciative to all the people that made it.  It is one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever seen.

bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaSong?
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaI was surprised how much I liked this when i first watched it about 2008 as a guy in their mid 20&#39;s¬†but I have rewatched it like 10 times since good humour/scenery soundtrack etc could have something to do with beautiful Marion Cotillard maybe i will never know :). I also loved Under the Tuscan Sun as well which has a similarish feel to this.
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaThis is one of the best underrated movies ever
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaIt was actually a good year 2006
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaWatched the movie like 30 times but the trailer still gives me goosebumps
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaThis was a fabulous movie
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaI adore this movie
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaThe song at the end is &quot;chanches&quot; by Westlife!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaterrible trailer, fantastic film
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaWatched this movie during summer vacations, I will remember this moment forever. By the way the song wisdom from the movie brings back a lot of good memories. I know I will come back to this comment at some point, hello older me!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer is 20 times more exciting than this snooze of a film.
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaFreddie Highmore
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaCame here cause I just read an article about how this movie tanked at the box office....now I get it
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaGreat, so relaxing! Like a good wine, a good book. Well done, Mr. Scott!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaTrying to imitate, well ! even not simple! !Good to watch movie !!!
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitafilm
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaJust watched it now . Was a breath of fresh air .. Mhhhh the love story captured me , the meaning of life .
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaExcellent movie, music, photography, acting ...
bKKrLj5ZHiMdelimeterByIshitaIf only this film was better.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY THEY WILL SHOW THE MOVIE, they were to show 2014 but they cancel it.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWow that wasn&#39;t scary at all
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaeh, looks like a washed down version of cannibal holocaust... I may not zap away when they play it on tv
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIs this a comedy or nah?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe title made me think this was a superhero movie.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaDid anyone think of The Forest when they saw this?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaNow id rather let the forest burn
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaStill wanna go save the Rain Forest now eh? lool
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna get low ratings. I swear to god it&#39;s the forest concept.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitathat was so racist<br>and there aren&#39;t cannibal tribes in the Amazon<br>do your research right at least
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI guess this is a low budget film?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIts Pilar from sex ed lmao
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaBuenaaa  Ariel levy! Felicidades!, ya quiero ver la pel√≠cula.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaBoring
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitathis movie ever gonna be released?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWho saw Fetty Wap lmao 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaAfter 2 years it&#39;s finally going to get released...
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaEli Roth needs to be put to sleep like dog.¬† His movies are terrible.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaSince when did Fetty Wap start acting? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcpYPu9M3bw&amp;t=1m31s">1:31</a>
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitafor some reason this remind me a episode of South Park
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIs the name a pun because the movie is a hostile metaphor about the &quot;just desserts&quot; for people who care about the environment? ¬†That&#39;s really the whole thing, I wish it wasn&#39;t so juvenile and plain.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaofc main hero will survive. boring
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIt reminds you of Cannibal Holocaust because essentially it is the modern day version.<br><br>Not to mention that movie was originally titled the Green Inferno.<br>Is this movie actually going to get released this year or what?<br>(:
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaNot original but seriously that&#39;s TRUE PURE Horror! None of this Insidious BS!
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! I just Seen Knock Knock &amp; it was very good! Lorenza Izzo performance in it was very good &amp; I&#39;m looking forward to seeing her in this. 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaAl fin un buen argumento para una pel√≠cula
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI want to see this movie looks good for me!
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLorenza Izzo &lt;3
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIf it&#39;s an Eli Roth film, that means it&#39;s going to contain the kind of sick, demented, utterly disgusting shit that infests his mind on a daily basis.<br><br>No thanks, I&#39;d rather watch &#39;Crossroads&#39;...that&#39;s enough torture and mental anguish for me...
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaJeez. 0-100 real quick 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitalooks like a big ol eli roth fart. thanks hollywood
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaOh now it&#39;s being released. I thought it was lost forever
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe actual tribes that live in the Amazon are not this scary. Just give them some gum and you get a foot rub.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.¬† I wonder how many people will call it racist, and say it detracts from the plight of indigenous people and deforestation?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWell...shit.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaeli roth the jew that screwed my wallet with his other horror movie
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaOops, I seemed to have made a mistake clicking this.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIt`s funny to see comments of people that take a movie too serious.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWill the DVD edition have a blooper reel at the end?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWheres sky ferreira 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaSomehow i was expecting something with Orks dunno why. Too much WH 40k i think.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaIts basic movy
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaGud bt mmmmmmmmm
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitawell were boned
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitahaha omg :D¬†<br><br>the forest - film version
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitafinally there gonna release the movie
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitalol hahaha serve you right justice warriors and feminists.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI swear this movie came out 2 years ago.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaCannibal holocost 2??????
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe Forest, The Game... I mean Movie
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWe had to wait 2 years for The Green Inferno to release in theaters. I smell bullshit.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m surprised Blumhouse had anything to do with this movie since it doesn&#39;t look like those crap found footage movies they usually put together.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaCorrect me if am wrong but am i the only person who thought that wasn&#39;t scary 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaAww, it&#39;s not a new trailer. Good that the film is finally being released tho.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI dont like gore porn horror movies but that opening scare was pretty cool. I thought the main girl was Mila Kunis for a second.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaFor those who don&#39;t know this is a remake of cannibal holocaused , you know that snuff movie that got band ? Yeah green inferno is a remake of it 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThat plane crash scene looked like a bite size version of the crash of Oceanic flight 815.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m hoping they all die.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLol reminds me of the forrest
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitathey seem fucked
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis guy just needs to stop making movies. He gets hard or something when he looks at these shit movies.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaWaste of your life watching this trailer, let alone watching the whole f***king movie
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe makers of HOSTEL had a part in this movie.....I would have went with HOSTEL 3 in place of this BS<br><br>These kind of movies I normally see on the syfy channel lol
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe part where they all surrounded the girls, reminded me of the Cannibal Movie<br><br>Anyway, would watch
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaJust another cannibal movie huh?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis is just The Forest turned into a movie
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitai swear to god i saw this trailer like last year
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLmao, how could a horror set in daylight hours ever have the same impact?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not a fan of horror movies and this doesn&#39;t look scary at all...js
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis might be the first horror movie in forever that doesnt look cheesy. 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaGets delayed again‚Ä¶
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaYou heard it people. Don&#39;t save the rain forest because it will kill you.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis looks hilarious 
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe cage is made out of wood. Break out when they are asleep. Also no one sent a rescue force after the plane crashed?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis is just the same thing as the other trailers
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaAw sweet! Far Cry the movie!
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitawell this looks awful...
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaHorror? no, but I think it&#39;s thriller.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitauuuuhhhh hell no.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitayou get what you deserve you freaking hippies
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitawoooo another movie I have no interest in seeing! amazing
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitashit this took an unexpected turn
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaCannibals?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaDEATH TO HIPPIES!
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshita-group crash lands<br>-natives find them<br>(insert shocking bullshit here)<br>-natives kill most of them<br>-one or two escape¬†<br>-traumatized face at the end<br>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†roll credits
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitarainforest smainforest
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaSo a group of liberal leftist hippies that think they can change the world by trying to stop other countries from doing things. ¬†That crash land and get taken by a barbaric (non white) tribe and tortured? AWESOME!
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe Forest, the movie?
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaHopefully this will be worth watching..
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaLOL and now you go there and save the forest !! :D
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaHostel in jungle ...
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaFIrST COMMENT LOOOOOOOL

FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is racist.

FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaAt least it isn&#39;t another horror film about ghosts and demons
FcpYPu9M3bwdelimeterByIshitaThe forest?

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaWorth the risk? WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaAnyone knows the tracks name at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TLppsfzQH8&amp;t=0m40s">0:40</a>min?
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI&#39;d take it... you know... If I knew where to find that same guy that sells weed cocaines
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshita@adderall
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaTechnically this is a rip off to a crapy movie  And that movie that they ripped off also ripped off the end of the manga series of elfen lied   And the movie this film ripped off is Lucy which came out a year before hopefully this movie was better though I hope
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaLucy reaches 100% of her brain becomes omniscient and omnipresent<br>this boy: learns a few languages and solves math problems.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshita&quot;Math became useful.&quot;
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaSO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music}
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s about Modafinil.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI want that NZT pil
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThis is actually about the prescription nootropic modafinil it&#39;s not a stimulant or amphetamine based nootropic hense limitless portraying a pill that doesnt have a crash, its non addictive, and actually alows you to access memory and recall while promoting wakefullness and clarity at the same time with little to no side effects. That being said it really is limitless, obviosuly in a fictional sence you wont be superhuman or just with the snap of a finger pick up on auras or anything like that lol but its effects are defiantly unlike any other nootropic ever encountered.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a myth that we only use 10% of our brain
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaImagine NZT while playing fortnite
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaYou can achieve this kind of genius through mental training...it take few years
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI have bigger iq without tablets.<br><br>- I used all of it to see my dreams alive.<br><br>So it is so. :-) And I get younger.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaYeah, it&#39;s called adderall.

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaAnother about this bs &quot;fact&quot; that we only use a part of our brain. It is not true ffs. We just didn&#39;t know what part was for what. We know alot more about it now. They are actualy mapping out the brain
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitasuch a great movie!! offing loved it
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe pill is a PLACEBO!!! WE ARE ALL LIMITLESS! we just put SELF IMPOSED limits on our selves!!!
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaWho uses this trailer as daily motivation?!
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitasing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TLppsfzQH8&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a> ?

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThis movie is a great display of the unlimited potential that we all possess , drug aside , it&#39;s really achievable as long as we change our attitudes , generate more focus in learning , and developing healthy habits. Best movie I&#39;ve ever seen and it&#39;s not even close !
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaLimitless is a 2011 American science fiction mystery thriller film directed by Neil Burger. Starring Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, they delivered a fine performance in the leading roles. The film is an adaption of Alan Glynn‚Äôs novel. Released on March 18, 2011, the film became an instant box-office success.¬†<br><br>A mysterious nootropic enables Eddie (B.Cooper) to access one hundred percent of his brain abilities. He gets on his feet again: the pill brings him a job on financial markets but also puts him in danger. After numerous twists and turns, there‚Äôs a nail-biting finale. It just seems too good to be true and that is primarily what grips you through this well-paced screenplay.<br><br>It‚Äôs a big budget movie with a powerful performance from the actors. The movie has some hair-raising chases and mind-blowing scenes. Having a fast-moving story, the film really keeps your eyes on the screen and makes your heart to beat faster. The only weakness I would think is worth mentioning, is that the film may be really violent, which would not be necessary.¬†<br><br>I found the film really far-fetching since our society is built upon a life, where people are forced to be successful but don‚Äôt have a work-life balance. The movie amused me and it‚Äôs pure 105 min of joy when you are into action and handsome actors.

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitai just saw the movie and this trailer is amazing! its packed whith stuff that makes u want to see the movie but the bast parts or momens are shortcutted in the trailer. (the few thats in the trailer) and it spoils noting! best trailer of a movie i have sean so far! not like movies today where u just pack all the funniest and most epic cheens from the movie and pack it into a trailer that spoils everything...   trailer 10/10    /\    movie 8/10
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaBradley and Robert are soul brothers... Check out Silver Linings Playbook...
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI remember that the end of this movie sucked
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitalooks like trash

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaOne of my favorite movies ever
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI love the TV series they made out of this
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe bit about the 20% brain use triggered me.. that is a myth!
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe name is Junkie..
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThey are aware that we use 100% right
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitabest coca√Øne commercial ive seen
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaYou guys must take meth. That&#39;s all you need to become LIMITLESS.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe only part I hate about, Brad is smart enough to make 2 million in 1 week with the 100k he borrowed from a loan shark, but too stupid to pay him back the $$? Doesn&#39;t make sense
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaModafinil
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaI loved this movie. I could see it hundreds of times and not get angry. The plot is very good, I got a little sad when it was finished. I wish it was a series and not a movie. If you have the time to see it, you will not regret it. I saw her with my friends, my boyfriend, my family, I wanted to show her all.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitatv show was just as good love them,both
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThis or Lucy ? Watched Lucy and absolutely loved it but contemplating if I should watch this or not

4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe reason I looked this up is because I&#39;m about to watch it on demand yay
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitanot really a classic trailer at all since four years ago was not a long time.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaPublished on Aug 12, 2013<br>but the trailer is from 2011
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitanever knew about this till now, the serie is good, like the ssequela of this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23cool">#cool</a>
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaThe CBS TV show by the name of that 2011 movie is high in the candy.  In the movie, the super brain is less able than in the TV show of 2015.
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaA perfect movie that deserve a second part¬†
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaLUCY
4TLppsfzQH8delimeterByIshitaHow is that an old trailer? 2011 was like 2 years ago.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaHe literally has the power of lens flares.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaLet the midnight special shine a light on me..‚ô™‚ô´ CCR
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaWB is cookin up some pretty weird shit lately....
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaPersonally think Michael Shannon is one of the best actors around now. First noticed him in Premium Rush and was really impressed. Seen him in The Bug, The Iceman, Take Shelter. Great in every one of them. Would really like him in a remake of Death Wish. Seems like he&#39;d be great for the part.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaSo this is what Zod been up to.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaThe Origins of - Cyclops
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaGENERAL ZOD HAS A SONNNNN!!!!!!
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitathis trailer remembers me of looper.The scenes with that kid is similar to the scenes in looper
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaIn the first 3 seconds I already decided I&#39;d go see this movie
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaDude. That&#39;s Kylo Ren.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaGiving me a district 9 type of vibe looks really good
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaGood CAST
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaKylo... AND Zodd?!
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaso basically iron man married to Cyclops and produced a child. and general zod is <br>taking care of him being a good guy. 2016 is coming 2016 is coming with a load of comics :D
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaFirst this I thought of was &quot;A story about cyclops as a child....wtf?&quot;
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaThis is a bullshit trailer, the whole trailer is so confusing and i have no idea what is the problem with the fucking kid...
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaCyclops : Origins
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaDamn it gave me some chills! Reminds me   &#39;&#39;Children of the damned&#39;&#39; with Christopher Reeve! MAaaannn!

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI am Titanium
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI WILL FIND HIM!
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone else notice the M83 &quot;Midnight City&quot; reference in this film? The child with the radiant eyes that has psychic powers. If you havent seen the music video for M83 do so. Its worth the look.

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI thought this trailer was related to M83 &#39;Midnight City&#39;, at least they could have used the song in the trailer, it would have been more exciting! The movie name, his eyes most of the stuff can be related to that song, its a beautiful song!

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshita<b>General Zod shouldn&#39;t have had sex with a human, IT IS FORBIDDEN!</b>
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaSo... looks like the kid is dying at the end of the trailer.... or pulling an ET and he&#39;ll get better once his fellow er... mutants? come rescue him.Anyway, seriously.. looks like a really cool movie. Very Firestarter feel to it.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitawtf
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaIntriguing. Starts like a low-budget art-house drama, finishes like a Stephen King adaptation (&quot;Firestarter&quot;-like, sort of).<br>This one might be a sleeper. Let&#39;s hope the next trailer (if any) doesn&#39;t reveal too much.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitathe name needs work, it doesn&#39;t fit. but overall it looks very interesting and I can&#39;t wait to see it.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaIts the kid from Looper.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI want to see Michael Shannon in more comedies not this crap
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m intrigued

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaSo great, I&#39;m very very impatient ! Jeff Nichols is a genius
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI will finish what you started.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaCyclops origin story?
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaThis movie will be special particularly if you see it at midnight.

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaHmm...

oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaReady
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaIs it the story of Midnight City by M83  ??  O_o<br>This is the same boy with the same powers with the same title : Midnight
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaLooks awesome
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaThis has the feel of an 89&#39;s Spielberg Sci-fi adventure, and it being helmed by the great Jeff Nichols? Count me in!
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaHm, the title of this movie is an old prisoner song, no?
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaZod is back as a good guy.<br>And Kylo Ren is in this too? Just noticed.
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m in
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitai llllove these films
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitazod is helping superman??
oVgxxdu-gJcdelimeterByIshitaGreat and first
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell? This looks like shit
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaAbsolutely one of the most underrated movie of last decade.
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaMost underrated film of the last decade.
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaConsidering I love doing improv comedy, I really want to check this film out now!
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitauhhh is that the girl from the song &quot;fuck me in the ass because I love jesus&quot; üòÇ
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitathis was a great movie in my opinion if anyones considering watching it
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitathat was racist
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great... I only know the work of three out of the cast, Birbiglia, Jacobs, and Key... love all three... but the whole thing looks brilliant. When I lived in NY, I knew some people in a comedy troupe (didn&#39;t everybody)... and they were all hilarious, all wildly competitive with each other. It was bizarre to hang out with them, because they&#39;d all circle me and try to make me laugh...
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is featured in the last half of the trailer?
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaSuper excited to watch this and please let there be a season 3 of TCGS!
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitalooks terrible
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaHugh Jackman at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzbJXNiEdEg&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a> !
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaIt has it&#39;s flaws, but this is a poignant movie looking at how friendships change through the successes and failures of life.  I‚Äôm a cinephile, and I think this is the best movie of the year so far:  #1 Don‚Äôt Think Twice, #2 Eye in the Sky, #3 Weiner, #4 Zero Days
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaThis was such a fabulous movie!  Don&#39;t get fooled into thinking it&#39;s a comedy about improv--or even an &quot;insider&quot; movie that only appeals to the entertainment industry.  It&#39;s a wonderful movie about following your dreams and how we all need to periodically re-evaluate what we want from life.
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t this out in Canada :(
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaWhy isn&#39;t it playing in my state!? Life is so hard. 3: <br><br>Srsly tho, I really enjoyed Sleepwalk With Me. Had no idea they were doing another film. I can&#39;t wait to see it!
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaBRITTA
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitathis looks terrible
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaI have a feeling this movie is going to kick me in the balls a lot.  Come to our improv show, Fuck This Week tonight at 8pm it&#39;s Free and byob! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sigh">#sigh</a>
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaThis look really good!
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaThe girl with the short black hair is from &quot;fuck me in the ass because I love Jesus&quot;.. I know cos I saw Reaction Time react to itüòÇüòÇ
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaAnyone know the third song from this trailer?
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaI think i&#39;m not hipster enough to like this...
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the name of the second song?
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaJust from the trailer, I can see that he&#39;s got the improv comedy scene down.  <b>nods</b><br><br>This... this is my life.
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaMike Birbiglia feels like if Woody Allen was actually a nice and honest person instead of a creepy narcissistic pseudo-intellectual. So I&#39;m excited to see this.
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitak
rzbJXNiEdEgdelimeterByIshitaGlad to see Mike Birbiglia directing some more. His comic brilliance will be recognized eventually.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaThis is actually the sequel to the Alice in Wonderland book Through the Looking Glass
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitagood thing Disney is making this, cuz you know it probably wont suck
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaI think this movie looks lame.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaPeople , this is the SEQUEL 2 the disney cartoon ;o   Alice is now 19 and the red queen has takin&#39; over wonderland. But tim burton called it just &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot;, because everbyody already knew the original story so he wanted to make a new story with a mix of the looking glass and stuff
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitayes yes YES.

a world of yes to this movie.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaho man i can not wait............my fav director......i think im gonna be alucinating jjajajajajaj......pufff pufff.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaWay too much Mad Hatter... I mean, Alice says one line and a scream. 
Helena Bonham-Carter looks really cool tho.

pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshita&#39;alice returned to wonderland&#39;

so is this more of a sequel? 
im glad Anne Hathaway is moving more into a serious career, she is a great actress
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaSo this is gng to be about when she returns to wonderland? Not when she first goes?
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshita1:41 i see a jaberwocky!~
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaWHOOOHOOOOOO This looks AWESOME!!!
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaWhen I heard there&#39;s going to be another Alice in WLand I was sure I won&#39;t watch it, but... This trailer is impressive, the whole movie is much darker and a bit weirder than I thought, but this makes it so awesome. This is the way to get grownups watch a story what we had seen more than 100 times.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitatim burton needs to get off jonny depp&#39;s nuts
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitahow is he capable of reinventing himself? johhny depp is meant for burtons.
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaOK, so I thought it was going to be a strait-up retelling, but it looks more like a sequel. It actually looks closer to American McGee&#39;s Alice game. Looks very cool
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitasimplemente genial
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaOh my jesus! this looks so cool! love Johnny&#39;s laugh lol
pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaPerfect

pMiCJefpn9QdelimeterByIshitaOMG, every time I watch this trailer I get more excited. It leaves me breathless.

0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaCan‚Äôt wait for the Sneed movie
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaI sadie sink drinks
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaIs it Chuck? or is it The Bleeder ? Or is it Chuck, The Bleeder?
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaI‚Äôm in the airport next to the real Chuck inspiration
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaIt looks like a good movie, and at the same time, there‚Äôs often something off.  For a movie about a famous boxer, I don‚Äôt get why every punch we see in the trailer are weak (super slow).  That punch at the beginning during a round was pretty slow and yet, trew his opponent on his ass.  Also that punch in the mirror.  He looks like He fist bump the mirror but shatters it.  I‚Äôm sure there are good parts too tho.  Is it a good movie ?
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaonly watching it because sadie is in it
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaWhen I was 19-years-old, I used to see Chuck Wepner every morning standing at the entrance gates as all of the factory workers walked through the gates into the noisy polluted air of the Western Electric factory, a city unto itself on the west bank of the Passaic River in Kearny, New Jersey. At the time (1972) Wepner was a security guard in a full-fledged police uniform.  The factory was so enormous it had its own police and fire departments, and an indoor mall that the workers could buy clothes, shoes, and other clothing accessories at.  At night, the workers would drive in a line of 30-40 dump trucks filled with poison refuse, that they secretly dumped into the Passaic River. Afterward, at lunchtime, I would stand on the east bank of the Passaic River, where for three days you could see an almost endless assembly line of dead fish floating north down the river. I used to wonder how many hundreds of millions of fish they had killed during their polluted existence of this environmental disaster of a factory that lasted several decades. It was a sad and disgusting sight to see. During WWII, this factory employed about 75,000 people which operated around the clock twenty-four hours a day.  During this time, I used to go and watch Chuck Wepner box frequently. He was sort of my hero because I felt I knew him on a somewhat persona level, even though I never spoke to him as I went through the factory gates a few minutes before 7 a.m. five days a week. My girlfriend Cindy, who also worked in the factory, thankfully in their offices where she didn&#39;t have to breathe in the hot-polluted air that frequently gave the workers endless headaches. On March 8, 1974, Cindy and I went to Madison Garden in New York City to see Wepner in his third bout of the trilogy he had with the talented Randy Neumann for the New Jersey Heavyweight title. Even though the match was in New York, the contest was held with New Jersey Rules, meaning two-minute rounds instead of the now universal three-minute rounds. The two boxers had split their first two mills, both by 12-round decisions. In their third and final fight, Wepner, despite being ten years older than Neumann at (35), won by stopping Neumann In the 6th round on a TKO in an exciting bout. Approximately two weeks later Cindy and I saw Wepner at a local Bayonne tavern named BAR 39 because it was on 39th street. Cindy and I approached Wepner who was sitting at the bar. Cindy was an incredibly beautiful girl. When she walked by, heads turned. She was blessed with a better figure than most Playmates of the month and was twice as beautiful as any of them that I saw in the plentiful Playboy magazines that were ubiquitous throughout the Western Electric factory. We simply wanted to extend our congratulations to our then-favorite boxer, The Bayonne Bleeder, Chuck Wepner.  I walked up to Wepner with a bottle of Budweiser in my hand and lightly tapped Chuck on his left arm, which felt like it had a brick implanted in it. I said, &quot;Mr. Wepner, my girlfriend Cindy and I saw you knockout, Randy Neumann a couple of weeks ago at the Garden. We just wanted to congratulate you on your great championship victory.&quot;  Wepner was very polite and said, &quot; Why thank you very much.&quot; He then stood up towering over my 5&#39;9 being, and warmly shook my hand. Chuck then said &quot;That&#39;s very nice of you. I appreciate it very much.  Say, can I buy you and your girlfriend a drink? I see you want a beer &quot; Ias I gratefully nodded and responded, &quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot; Chuck then said, &quot;What can I get your girlfriend?  And then screamed at the top of his ample lungs &quot;A glass of piss?&quot; He then laughed and howled like he had made some kind of a clever joke.   Nobody was laughing but him. Walking away, I turned and said, &quot;Thanks for doing something we will always remember you by.&quot; After that classless act, I realized that when you see someone you hold out as a hero, meeting them can be a truly dreadful experience. That primarily because you find out what a terrible low-life scumbag they really are in reality. After that, I rooted against Wepner in every fight he had for the rest of his career as a human punching bag. Too bad that scene wasn&#39;t in the movie so people could really know what a piece of shit he was as a human being. Wepner was a clown and I loved it when Andre The Giant threw his dumb ass out of the ring into the fourth row. It couldn&#39;t have happened to a more deserving scumbag bum.  Not so much a bum as a boxer, but as a shitty person. Go fuck yourself, Chuck!!! You were an abysmal bum who only got the fight with Ali because you happened to be a big white punching bag of a boxer.  Wepner turned out to be an alcoholic cocaine addict, besides a huge asshole who went to prison. What goes around comes around. Believe me, Wepner was not a good person period who winded up in prison, I&#39;m confident deservingly so. Chuck The Fuck was a big bully without a scintilla of class and a lousy ass boxer whose only asset was having a thick head to absorb all the punches he took. &#39;The Bayonne Bum&#39;  who wasn&#39;t worth shit as a human being in my experience. Hopefully, he changed for the better. But I will always remember Wepner as &#39;Chuck The Fuck&#39; a rotten punk and a lousy boxer who wouldn&#39;t have ever had the opportunity to be in the same ring as the great Muhammud Ali, except for being the beneficiary of having been born white. If he were black, nobody would have ever made a movie about such a low-life bum.
0AQXwOOqNNwdelimeterByIshitaWho else thought this was a movie sequel to the 2007 show Chuck with Zachary Levi??? Caaaaaaaaaaause I did.

guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaVery gratified towards those who mentioned KALIPRIVATEHACKS the best hacking service site, If you are in need of their service for spying, cloning, funding and many more, visit them on whatsapp +12097917177 or contact them on instagram @Kaliprivatehacks_official the best
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaYou know it&#39;s a good movie if there&#39;s a naked Jennifer Anniston
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaCan somebody please record this movie for me please, I will sub to there channel, pls pls pls üòÅ
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI was expecting a romantic comedy but its more like a drama. Jennifer and Vince are very good but a little disappointed by the subject especially by the end
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThe craziest part to me is he‚Äôs playing GTA San Andreas and not even to look retro but just because that was the big game at the time...
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaSome good Vince lines, including the one about &quot;all night long&quot; and &quot;big dumb Polacks with no future&quot;--but the highlight by far is Jen&#39;s nude walk through the apartment.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaAnyone who as watched full series of FRIENDS then comment here some pickup lines from Friends.üòâüòÄ Best sitcom forever<br><br>How you DOIN&#39;?
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaVv is gross. saw him at a party in Los Angeles. He‚Äôs such a bro, not boyfriend or husband material at all - what I mean is he doesn‚Äôt know how to treat a woman.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWait a minute, was that bartender Jon Favereau
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI still don&#39;t get why she would get back together with him.....
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThis is one realistic movie. Underrated. Go watch it!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshita<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guRKt55XOfU&amp;t=0m46s">0:46</a> is this happy?? Spiders far from Home...
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWho ever wrote the ending to this movie should rethink their role as a writer
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaEwwwww!! Never thought YouTube would recommend me to find Pete and Rachel together!!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaOkay so here was where that all naked tik tok challenge stuff started!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThat movie made no sense to me... his character is so lazy unlikeable and childish... why would anyone accept his poor behaviour and then even want him back?
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThere is a painting on the wall, wich, I&#39;m pretty sure, painted by Jennifer, because she studied in a Steiner school, and the painting is soooo &quot;steinery&quot;. :))))
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaRoss can close his eyes and still see her nacked, this guy can never do that for sure.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI just watched it. Really love this movie. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as good af.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWe were on a break!<br><br>-Ross
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWE.. WERE... ON .. A ... BREAK.. wait, what?
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaHe was a narcissist. Many issues to overcome. He couldn&#39;t really change. Better without him, she saved herself.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaSmartness is important in marriage and in a relationship and I‚Äôm glad that cyberhackinggenius helped cloned my husband‚Äôs phone. I got access to all his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his phone. All I did was share my husband‚Äôs phone number with Cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone without having to touch his phone. My husband was a cheating Narcissist and I‚Äôm glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of cyberhackinggenius. I‚Äôm here in UK and able to access my husband‚Äôs phone messages with a link on my phone even while he was away in Canada cheating on me. I got to discover that my husband who is legally married to me here in UK is also recently married to another woman in Canada and I‚Äôm finally going through a divorce with lots of evidence against him. I read all deleted and recent chats on his Whatsapp, Twitter,Facebook,Instagram messages and Skype. You can contact this great Hacker Gavin via Gmail  (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and I hope you find peace of mind after finding the truth just like myself!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWhy is this in my recommendeds after I watch the movie? Just saying it‚Äôs not worth watching
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaName of the movie should have been ‚Äúout of his league‚Äù
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathis was one of the saddest films i have ever watched and i almost started crying just watching it
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThis movie was just so bland and meh. Not like horrible, but just not engagig. Turned it off after 40 minutes.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s happy hogan!!!!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaWhat men would break up with JA?<br>...unless you&#39;re BP.<br>lol
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaAll I can see is that Rachel greene and Pete Becker are in the same movie üòÇ
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaAsk for Telly Savalis? Vaxing named after Jennifer Aniston godfather, it&#39;s unresepectful.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathumbs up
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThis was actually a surprisingly original movie, if you can get it

guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaJennifer is looking realy sweet in dis movie
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI like the ending. It&#39;s not that sweet bs you always see in these kind of movies. It reminds you that sometimes that&#39;s how life goes.

guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitabefore watching the trailer... My mind was repeatedly thinking &#39;WE WERE ON A BREAK!&quot; lol
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaHell! i recommend movies rarely but watch this one!
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaTelly savala saving lifes out there
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s just something about Jennifer Aniston that makes me want to punch something. Barf.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathat&#39;s Pete from friends
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaHe was 100 percent and she was 100 percent as is with most relationships.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaUsually in these movies, both the man and woman are a little wrong and a little right.  In this one, Vince Vaughn&#39;s character was totally to blame.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathis is like one of the worst trailer with so many big names
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Polish proud&quot; tee... :D
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaJUST FINISHED WATCHING THIS
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaAnd by the way- the only guy who couldn&#39;t evade that fight his girlfriend was trying to start in the beginning of the movie is an idiot.  His every answer was pretty much the perfect one to only enrage her more.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThe movie would be better if they made Anniston&#39;s character an asshole as well.  A few funny moments but really no tension for me.  Her boyfriend was clearly a narcissistic selfish asshole and should she have broken up with her.  All the guy had to do to keep a hot awesome white bread girlfriend was clean the dishes when company comes over and keep a shopping list right and he could do that?
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThat laugh at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guRKt55XOfU&amp;t=1m35s">1:35</a> - Buzz Lightyear at a tea party
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaIt is so emotionalüòûüòûüòû
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m done
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitamovie - awful
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaA break up 90 percent the women&#39;s fault usually.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaRotten tomatoes is usually on point, especially the audience ratings but they both ranked this below 50, I don&#39;t get it.......probably watched this a dozen times &amp; still laugh every time, the only thing I could think of is sometimes when I see a movie in the theater I might not think its that good but then when I see it at home a few months later it will be a lot better &amp; also the more u see a movie it can grow on u like some songs.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitawhere there is rachel, there is a break-up
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshita2 years? That&#39;s not even a coffee break of a relationship.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t believe this movie is already 10 years old...
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitai dont like that actor
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaKinda not into Vince.¬† He&#39;s some funny and then there&#39;s this kinda...not. mmm
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitai cried sooo much in the end ugh
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaNice cheeky bit of classical GTA at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guRKt55XOfU&amp;t=2m07s">2:07</a>
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThat moment when you realize that trailers with narrative are awkward.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitagta san andres xD
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI heard that this film showed that Jennifer Aniston was desperate to have sex and to settle down.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathe ending is kinda sad
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThe ending of the movie sucked
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitathey still didn&#39;t get back together.. even tho the ending maybe kinda implied it.. it wasn&#39;t said! üò≠ they should&#39;ve got back together.. or at least decided to start all over.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guRKt55XOfU&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> Hes wearing a t-shirt with the polish eagle :3
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThis kinda pisses me off..
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitai hate the ending
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaI am actuallly from Poland
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitacongratulations you just saw the whole movie...
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a dry romantic comedy with a few punch lines. Does anyone who has seen it think it is any good?
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaThe minute that I watched this trailer, I knew right from the start that this sleazy piece of crap wasn&#39;t worth going to see and I&#39;m beyond glad that I didn&#39;t.
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitai stink of poo
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaSo her brothers name is Richard and she goes on a date with a guy named Mike someone should have thought this through 
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitadefinitely a chick flick
guRKt55XOfUdelimeterByIshitaJenn I love you baby!&#39;&quot;

IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaBest thriller movie ever
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaüî•üî•üî•üî• <br> This is a really cute movie <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjF5wdY8zE0&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> üíüüíò <br>   üëá üëá üëá üëáüíï
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe conclusion of this awesome movie is that if you are a bully at school you will get your karma sooner or later ;)
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaTime for some simon says.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe only thing that sucked about this movie is that it didn&#39;t get the credit that it deserves.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIf you see Joel Edgerton in a film, you know it&#39;s a good intelligent film. Jason Bateman also performs very unusual and convincing. Recommended.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaYep. Awesome.<br>
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaDope. I get it.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaYou think you done with the past. But past will be never done with you!.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitawhen i see jason bateman i see teenwolf 2
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaDolly benson
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitathis is like &quot;the cable guy&quot; but modified
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaeven in this movie he&#39;s a bad person but i still love,like,&amp; big fans of him ( joel edgerton )
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitais this really a horror movie? it looks like ah, <br>action movie for me!! <br><br>haha lol....
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaTrailer tells too much! Had to stop watching it 1 minute in.... didn&#39;t want to spoil the suspense of the film when I actually watch it. Dam trailers!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis movie is all about holding a grudge and getting even with someone who genuinely deserved every inch of garbage that gets shoved down their throat for their past mistakes.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s the bully? Simon or Gordo?
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis movie was mental. And the ending, oh my, the ending. No chill
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaTHIS MOVIE SUCKED!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitathis is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen.but in the end in real life if i wear gurdo i would turcher and kill simon.but because it is a movie they dont like you to get any ideas.(great movie)
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshita-veiooh q filme fodaaah
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIt was a good movie!!!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitathe trailer reminds me of &quot;Cache&quot; film by Michael Heneke
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaDid Simon kill someone? ¬†Can&#39;t wait to see the finale!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshita<b>***possible spoiler alert*****</b><br><br>Am I the only one who sees a possible homosexual twist? The villain seems to be going after the husband &amp; the husband&#39;s secretive past. On Fandango, many &quot;critic&quot; reviews hint at a &quot;controversial twist.&quot; I think that&#39;s the writing on the wall.....
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI think Simon and Gordo used to be a gay couple... and that&#39;s what shocks her. Maybe the breakup was bad.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIs this also a book who is the author?
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis stupid  vidio won&#39;t stop showing up on my tablet and it is annoying me a LOT&gt;=( &gt;:( &gt;=(
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaYour ad is buggy me OMG u showed way too much I feel like I already seen the movie! Ugh stop with your damn ad&#39;s!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a movie you should see before your class reunion.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe Gift of full bore.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaGone be by gone or guns be by guns..means kill u..
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis may be the only horror movie i ever watch 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaWow, this trailer is awesome, I don&#39;t even have to watch the movie now.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaTom Buchanan at it again 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaWell shiet. Now I&#39;m terrified of the people who did the whole &quot;one-sided&quot; friendship thing to me. Honestly, I was being nice, but they get WAY too clingy, call themselves your best friend when you&#39;re not and it&#39;s not okay to push yourself onto people like that. I was never rude to them. I tried to be very nice to them but gesus....Now I&#39;m terrified.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI was going to see this movie....then I saw the dog and knew something bad will happen to it. soooo....not seeing it.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis movie looks good but they better not hurt that DOG!!!!¬†
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIt looks mediocre, but for Bateman&#39;s sake I hope it&#39;s good, he needs to do more serious roles.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaOh, God. They made a Simon Says movie? Really....
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaWasn&#39;t interested, looked like a generic stalker flick...<br>...Then you caught my attention with Jason Bateman&#39;s character apparently having some secret to do with Gordo&#39;s behaviour. Now we have intrigue.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaSome stalkers just don&#39;t want to stop (oh wait almost all stalkers don&#39;t, until something happens to them &amp;/or everyone....).
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe trailer is good but I hope it didn&#39;t give things away.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaJason Bateman in a new genre?  Very interested in seeing this now.üòÜüòÜüòÜ
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaGOD DAMN IT!!!<br>Why did the trailer show so much of the movie. I bet the part where they show the husband is not what he seems is at least halfway through the movie so now I can&#39;t build any expectations that he is an innocent victim being tormented by a psychopath and be surprised when I find out that maybe he deserves what he gets.<br>There goes a major plot twist and most of the suspense right out the fuckin window.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitacant wait to see it with friends
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI was waiting to laugh. I was waiting for that punch line. 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaPlot twist the husband and gordo are the same guy the husband cloned himself<br><br>I don&#39;t know where I got that idea but I&#39;m sticking with it.<br><br>Also the movie shoudlve been called &quot;Gordo&quot;
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaWHAT&#39;S IN THE BOOOOXXXX!? WHAT&#39;S IN THE FUCKING BOX!?
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it can someone explain plzz
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaChicks love these psycho guy type movies.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaNothing says I&#39;m done like when the wife&#39;s hair is shorter than the husband&#39;s
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaGrate trialer just gave too much away
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll admit, it looks pretty interesting. Has any release date been announced?
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaFirst time I sat through an ad that offered me to skip
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitai think it is something i would like to see ¬†all of it. very sepenceful
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis looks scary as shit 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI wanna see this!! 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThat dog was all like &quot;What&#39;s that bottle? Can I have it?&quot;
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI wonder if the twist is gonna be that Simon was a Bully in school and he was mean to Gordo who in turn became crazy and plotted revenge against him....Hmmmmm....Interesting!!! I definitely want to see this one!!!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t care if I saw like half or almost all of the movie, it looks creepy and got me interested and hooked into it so I wanna see it still when it comes out.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitai&#39;m sick.... cant wait for this.... Hurry up nd give the release date already !!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaLooks great!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer gave waaaay too much away.¬†
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaLiterally spoiled the entire movie except for the ending. ¬†Stop doing this.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIs anybody getting the feeling when a stranger calls movie
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI want to see this 
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI feel like I already saw 80% of the movie
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaLooks like the first frame of audio was inadvertently lined up to the green card; that&#39;s a REAL horror story!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaSTX ENTERTAINMENT<br><br>PLEASE READ THIS<br><br>The audio for this video seems to be way off. I&#39;m not sure, but I think it&#39;s about 5 seconds ahead of the video, like someone didn&#39;t account for the MPAA notice at the beginning. You may want to fix that.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe audio is not synced whatsoever. It really needs to be re-uploaded. Such a high budget movie with such a low budget ad. XD come on now...
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe audio is completely butchered on this ad...
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThat guy has issues.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaIs the audio completely unsynced for anyone else?
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThe audio and video are not synced
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaDef going to see this!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis is why you be nice to the weird kids bc they&#39;re weird for a reason
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI wanna watch this so bad.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaPlease tell me if I am wrong. But the bygones be bygones note.<br>Bygones- dates or occurances in the past.<br>So initially the husband did something horrible to Gordo or to someone else.<br>So bygones be bygones.<br>So things that happened in the past be things that happened in the past.<br>And the files on Simon, that shows he did something too.<br><br> Idk I&#39;m just going on limb here.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshita&quot;This is good. I&#39;m very happy,&quot; he said with a straight face, wondering how long it would be until lunch break.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitatwo thoughts while watching this:<br>1. I love it when Jason Bateman goes for darker movies<br>2. The dog! please don&#39;t kill the dog!
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitathis movie looks creepy and had me hooked, its on of those trailers that I didnt want to see whe was going to happen next. But then....they showed TOO much and killed it for me, dang.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI like this better with darude sandstorm¬†
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaGIVE THAT FATTY SOME FRIENDS
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis looks meh.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI need to watch this like now.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitathis looks so stupid. not even scary.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI really hope this switches gears near the end to Bateman being the bad guy and Gordo the wronged dork out for righteous revenge.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaI feel sorry for Gordo somewhat. I was always the outcast, the guy who never had that many friends. I hung by myself and read Philip K Dick and Kurt Vonnegut. I never was that close to anyone, and always seemed to hang with myself. Being exposed to people and suddenly realizing that you can&#39;t be with them anymore is very disheartening. I hope that this is sort of like Nightcrawler, with a deplorable anti hero that we care for and are so immersed in that character.
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaLooks astounding :)
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaHorror movies without supernatural stuff is always nice. People are scary enough
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaGood luck guys :) The movie is great
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaFirst I thought it was stupid but then it grew on me and I think this movie really has some potential
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaThis looks AMAZING,
IjF5wdY8zE0delimeterByIshitaLooks so damn good, so happy for Joel directing his first film. Wow, what a talent very impressed I&#39;ll be the first in line when this comes out this year.¬†

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitaThe presence of wrestlers and MMA morons makes this garbage even without seeing it.
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitai think they should have replaced Terry Crews with Michael Jai White, he seems more apt to be in a movie full of bad asses.

Its still gonna be SICK AS HELL though. 
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitaamazing!!!!!!! youuuuuuu A-Team have loads fans from 80s, then bove movies need to see :) unreal!!!

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshita@TheATeciak brucie is too old pal....he gotta retire from action...shift into drama :P
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitai think jet llis going to be a bad guy

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshita@jsamsonite07 
To bad that Brucie don&#39;t have much to do in this movie... I hoped for more of him, guess I need to wait for Die Hard 5.
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshita1:51 - Austin vs. Stallone
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitai do believe tht this wil be the biggest movie of the year not counting avatar. look at all the stars in it! thts a badass line up

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshita@ponder2006  no shit huh
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitaya i dont think arnold isn&#39;t gonna be in this movie very long. he&#39;s not even listed as a main character.  Overall this movie looks pretty good. I&#39;d watch it. Good song shinedown?

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitaSick cast!
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshita@dantedom1 oh hell no. it&#39;s probably one of those movies that are just mind-numbing, over-the-top awesome. in other words, it&#39;s self-aware.
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitagreat movie
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitawhy would they put all this icons from action movies all together? are they trying to send a message? about what? violence? imposing ideals of one country&#39;s bubble perception of righteousness  over smaller countries? I&#39;ve watched action movies for a long time and i think its time to grow up and see things for what they are. this is just another Hollywood tool of persuasion. oh wait maybe they are trying to attract the younger audience to see how cool is war?! which mean fresh meat for the army.
8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s his problem
he&#39;s the governor, that&#39;s the problem

8KtYRALe-xodelimeterByIshitaonly chuck norris can match this kind of awesomness.

nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaBecause &#39;Unfriended&#39; was already taken.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshita2.5/10 already.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaUnfriended did that, might try with Snapchat instead guys.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaWhere is candles?  Anybody should bring Lexa candles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitai dont get why she mad about
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaI LOVE ALYCIA SO MUCH AND I MISS LEXA
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaIs she a cousin of Laura Barns?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitafrom Lexa in the 100 to a horror movie discuss can a be good
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaI swear I have read this in Wattpad or whatever like 4 years ago
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitagood actor, shit movie
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitafacebook kils pepole if dont hawe friends xd
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaWhat you have you learned kids? Kids: Never unfriend a random chick you dont actually really know.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaYour fight is over Commander.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaNot another of these moves..
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaWas this the unfriended sequel they were talking about?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaLol
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThis is way better than unfriended!!
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaLexa, why?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaAs soon as I saw &#39;&#39;Laura has sent you a friend request&#39;&#39; my immediate reaction was: &#39;&#39;Holy shit, are they actually making a sequel to Unfriended?&#39;&#39;
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSo this is what its come down to huh? Horror movies completely ripping off other horror movies. And ripping off horror movies that aren&#39;t even good at that. Smh I swear if horror movies weren&#39;t dead before, they certainly are now it seems.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaIf Alycia doesn&#39;t show her rack at least once, there&#39;s not point in this movie.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t get it??!!?!?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaRemember kids: even if you don&#39;t like the person and you don&#39;t want to associate with that person (minding your own business), you have to follow them on Facebook, forcing yourself to associate with someone you don&#39;t like, or they will kill themselves, blame you for it, and make your life a living hell. Hooray for Lose-Lose situations!
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitanext movie  : the Friendzone
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDNgs0dgjj4&amp;t=1m08s">1:08</a> Are they going to tell us that they manged to get hold of the code to FBs back end systems... really... <br><br>And they want us to think that FB are crap coders as well...
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshita*crazy girls hunts computer**Turns on Antivirus, selects &quot;scan whole sistem*Problem solved

nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaWhy not use Fiverr? You can add 99999 friends in 50sec.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaAnd that kids, it&#39;s what happens when you buy Apple products. With Windows it wouldn&#39;t have happend
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitathe idea look stupid.<br>looks like a low budget stupid film
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaUnfriended 2....
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaso this is the new modern cliche horror storyline
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitawell i thought it will be about hacking and ruining someones life, but than she is a ghost and have possessed computers. well this suck.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThis is garbage nonsense. &quot;this isn&#39;t what code looks like&quot; oh really?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThis. Is. Stupid
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSocial media movies should just be biopics or better yet comedies. These horrors are so cringey
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThat girl seems to be in everything these days
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaReinstall the windows.. Update your anti virus or some shit.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaUnfriended prequel?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaI predict the next horror movie will have something to do with snap chat...
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaLooks like poopoo
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitacomplaint mark zukerberg or change to what&#39;s app
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaUnfriended 2 friend request
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSo.  When can we expect the Suey Identity to be out?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaA white girls nightmare! Coming this year!

nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSo this is Unfriended if that had not been entirely on a computer screen?
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaIt looks like Unfriended 2 to me
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaWowww‚òÜ
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitay couldn&#39;t the girl just except her friend request then we wouldn&#39;t have to watch this
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitathe opposite of unfriended? so it&#39;s actually gonna be scary
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSomeone find the director and slap him.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s crazy how scary movies try to relate to this society now like using social media haha
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m just watching this trailer because Alycia Debnam-Carey is in Fear the Walking Dead.

nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaCould we just.....not?<br>Like......ever?<br>Thanks movie.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaSo this is what its come down to huh? Horror movies completely ripping off other horror movies. And ripping off horror movies that aren&#39;t even good at that. Smh I swear if horror movies weren&#39;t dead before, they certainly are now it seems.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThis movie came out in my country and I watched it out of curiosity. <br>The movie is actually above average imo and is kinda fun to watch at times. I must say tho, the soundtrack of the movie is downright awesome.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaLol this looks so stupid
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaThis movie could have been interesting if a) it hadn&#39;t been done before and b) Facebook was still as popular as it used to be a few years ago.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaok this is actually a thing.
nDNgs0dgjj4delimeterByIshitaLexa what are you doinngggg???

BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaYay another acid trip incoming for me and the special person I choose
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaFilm doesn&#39;t look bad. I&#39;m just not catching any familiar Evil Dead vibes from this particular story. I feel as though it could have been called something else and it would have stood out more for me. Perhaps they are riding on the coattails of a popular horror franchise? - Smart thinking on a financial level; bet it saved them a boatload in marketing money.<br><br>I&#39;ll be watching, but this is just my two cents.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaüëéüëéüëé

BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaLets fcking GO!!!!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis actually looks like it&#39;s going to be a good movie.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaIf Bruce Campbell isnt in it then dont waste my time.Yup, not gonna pay to watch it.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaNot the same without Bruce and his goofiness. Just another horror movie

BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaBrutal. Horrific. Sadistic. Bloody. I&#39;m all in for this one!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaLove Evil Dead! So excited for this to come out!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t see Evil Dead movie here. All I see is a reboot of The Exorcist with some references to Evil Dead.<br>If seriously then the main problem here is that people are trying to make a horror movie out of franchise that originally was a satire on a classic horror movies stamps. If your writers or executives does not understand that then their competence is questionable.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaLooking good...well, horrible, but Good.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshita–ñ–¥—ë–º! –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫–∞ –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è)))) —Ö–æ—Ç—å –∏ —Ñ–µ–º—Å–∫–∞—è XD
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis looks great! Reminds me of REC 1 and 2 and that‚Äôs not a bad thing!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaGeneric, unoriginal and clich√©d trailer. I hope the actual movie is good.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaIf you enjoy this film trailer, you should go to Youtube and search for &quot;Campfire Revelation.&quot; You will love the EPIC battle between Michael Myers and the Wolfman!!! You will never believe who wins! &quot;Campfire Revelation&quot; is on the &quot;Scene Splice&quot; Youtube channel.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaLooks great, but for me the trailer shows me way too many scares that should have scared me watching the film. It gives away, way too much.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaI personally like all the horror no comedy.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaHas some exorcist feels I like it .)
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaEvil dead is seriously one of the most iconic horror franchise ever
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaBruce Campbell isn&#39;t in it, but you could tell he was instrumental with being involved in it in other ways. In other words you can tell he cares about his franchise/legacy. That makes me happy and really want to see it! üòÑü§ü
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaNow... that&#39;s a mother! Even in a possessed state, she is still taking time out to whip up some breakfast for her kids.üòÇ
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m so glad this is getting a cinema release. Not only because I want to see this on a big screen with an audience but it must be a sign that they think they&#39;ve got something great on their hands and the trailer would seem to corroborate.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaDno.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaWhy april? Should be released in october
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis looks terrifying, can‚Äôt wait
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaYES!!!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaYessssss been waiting on proper scary movie can‚Äôt wait to see this !!!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaOMG üò±üò±üò±üòçüòçüòç this looks terrifyingly Fantastic... We&#39;re all in for a wild ride with this one I CAN NOT WAIT to see this üòÉüòÄüòÑüòÅüòÅ
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaHands down already for the trailer. The 2013 Evil Dead movie, it&#39;s still one of my toplist &amp; gruesome dark gory bloody horror ever since. Looking forward for this new movie franchise - Evil Dead Rise soon!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaSo is this a sequel to the remake?
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaAll woman, no men, too much of a statement attempt, PASS
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is so much better than the red band trailer, oddly enough.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis looks like a beautiful familiar movie, Ty wb ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThe Dark Ones
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaAs I fan from the beginning I wanted to love this but the movie looks lame. Nothing creepy or edge look like just another big Hollywood messing up a movie franchise. Sorry Sam.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaShop smart, shop S-Mart
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaCAN&#39;T WAIT!!! üôåüî•
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaI hope they keep the dark comedy going forward, you can get a bit of a taste of it in this trailer when the deadites talk.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaNo it doesn&#39;t RED BAND is better this is just green band bullsh*t.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaWow! Love it.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaHow stupid do you have to be to hide a trailer when promoting a movie...
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitathis is bound to be a flop. despite all the blood and gore, the aesthetic looks so clean and aseptic...it has too many filters.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaWell, at least we now know the entire course of the movie, thanks to the Redband trailer that they turned the comments off for; on which family members get killed and turn into Deadites (in what order too!) and which ones make it to the end. It always just makes sense to give a whole movie away in a trailer!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaGroooooooovy
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaEveryone complaining needs to go watch the red band trailer.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaWhat this has to do with The Evil Dead‚Ä¶ looks like a generic possession movie
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitawowwwüòçüòçüòç
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaOmg noooo.a cast full of women?that destroyed the terminator franchise and will kill this one too.i loved this 2 franchises but putting a cast of all females lead is gonna make you lose your almost entire fanbase.damn it.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitamust see in cinema.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaLove it!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaü©∏ Not one, but two Official Trailers, thank you!<br>Also, here we are shown how Ellie becomes possessed... üòç
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaMeh.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaVarisu da üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üòÇ
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaYikes, this looks horrible.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitalooks good but a bit generic... if you didn&#39;t tell me this was &quot;Evil Dead&quot;, I really would pass it by. I hope I&#39;m wrong when I see the movie, but in the trailer I see a generic possession movie.
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaGroovy!!! Can‚Äôt wait üî•
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaThis. Looks. Beautiful!
BqQNO7BzN08delimeterByIshitaSweet
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks and sounds just like the amityville horror but with a male main role than the female main role if you haven&#39;t watched or read the novel yet you should its a classic :P 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshita@maxpowd3r haha for real.. She had no boobs and not even a NIPPLE
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaLook,s scary and grate
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThis is the reason I don&#39;t watch horror movies...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaOmg i think this might be the worlds scariest movie. I had to pause the trailer ;D
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaCarlyle!!!!!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaI just shit.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaI want to see it
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaoh shit that&#39;s tight
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s a movie about found footage, not a found footage movie
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitai guess its not as scary if you think about. they said it was just a deity that eats childrens soul. cmon uv learned about even more wierd dieties and gods in history class
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitalol the ground was shaking when i saw this
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThis isn&#39;t found footage.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaGreat. It&#39;s another found footage movie.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaoh fuck me...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitalol @ 2:18- the ghost pops up at the end.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m pretty sure this is going to be the closest thing we&#39;ll get.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaanyone who&#39;s a fan of spill.com, Carlyle wrote this movie, defiantly looking forward to it 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitacannot unsee
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThey should totally make a movie for slenderman :D
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaI just love getting freaked out before bedtime.mommy.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaTotally ...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look too bad reminds me of insidious
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitahaha the demon looks like Jim Root of Slipknot
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaJust like that Slenderman! :D
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaslenderman 1.5

_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaRallisp enyone 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaFINALLY, a film where white people actally try and leave the haunted house.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaman it totally shook me on 5.1 audio system
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitahere&#39;s the ending: they all the die at the end, since no horror movies can actually leave anyone worth it living anymore. I know that can be the point, but at the same time if you actually can scare people without killing everyone off then you have truly come up with something original
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitamommy
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitadammmmnnn this looks good!!

_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaShat my self! .... mulitiple times x(
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaIiiides u kuraac
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitawhere&#39;s sam and dean when you need them:)
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitagoddamn pagan gods!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaWhy doesnt he just burn the house down? Problem solved? 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitafinally a ghost movie that isn&#39;t a pg-13 load of crap with today&#39;s &quot;young hot actors&quot; it actually looks like it might be the next ghost movie classic. but we shall see...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaWe&#39;ve got a job for you Winchester boys.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaisn&#39;t that a wrestler or one of the slipknot guys?
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThis is the movie Carlyle from SPILL.COM wrote. He was a movie critic there and actually took on the &quot;do you think you could do better&quot; challenge. So far, it looks good.

The other members of Spill, did a review on the movie recently and said it was pretty good too.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitalooks like itll fail to be scary, shame
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaBadass
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaPagan god aye...... someone should call Sam and Dean xP
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitakinda reminds me of weeping angels (from doctor who meets amityville horror)
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaIs that Mick from SLIPKNOT ????
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitalooks good, and the funniest proly will be in the same time like another paranomal &#39;&#39;the borring&#39;&#39; crap :D? (dunno if thay shit will be in this year but who knows)
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaermmm... is that one of the guys from kiss?
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitadifferent writers but same producer. looks good cant wait. 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitajohnny!!!!!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaYour opinion is not being taken into consideration.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitalooks entirely different,you&#39;re just comparing because you seen that the producers are the same
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitayeah i agree but insidious was fucking scary... it sort of evens it out
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT!!! INSIDIOUS version 2 at it again trying to scare the shit outta me! havnt been scared of a film since the original the first Exorcist to Insidious!!!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThe demon guy looks like the dude from Slipknot
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaUgh, everything about Paranormal Activity is a disgrace. The writer the director everything, seeing that they have any hand in this is a little discouraging.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaHell yea Insidious was awesome.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s like Insidious meets the Woman in Black.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaNow i can&#39;t take a shower -_-
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitainsidious is scarier...

_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitathat shit looks like some guy from a death metal band from germany
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitasmart idea haha
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaJump scares *snore*
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshita@2:18 &quot;Oh this is just another one of those lame ass--&quot; @2:19 &quot;OH SHIT!!!&quot;

_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitajeez maybe horror films are starting to make a comeback... could be interesting
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitayou must not watch a whole lot of movies then cuz there is much worse lol if you have netflix check out thankskilling, that right there is the worst horror movie lol or Plan 9
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaoh hell no scary as fuck 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitawow, actually looks kinda scary.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaomg scary!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaCARLYLE
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThe beginning looked cool but then everything went kinda cheesy. Possibly good, I&#39;ll have to see.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitainsidious was the worst horror movie i have seen ever in my life, was so boing, poor story and was just fucking stupid, this one does look really good tho.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThe trailer scared the shit out of me! So the movie must be good!!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThat little boy really needs to cut his hair, I thought he was a girl. Geez these kids these days
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitayeah i saw him in the back garden takin a piss behind the tree
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaCould not help but think of the ring watching that I know its not exactly the same but a lot like it to me.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaThink i just shit my pants a little :(
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaVa estar muy buena... so good!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaInsidious was the best horror movie I saw since the exorcism of emily rose. I am willing to see this. Plus they have Ethan Hawk, I am sold.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaSlender
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaGuys No Lie Caryle from Spill.com wrote this movie! THIS IS WHY HE LEFT SPILL
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaIf this ended like PA and Insidious.... then it&#39;s not a happy ending one. THAT&#39;S GREAT!!
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaSlenderman is Ethan Hawke!  Now it all makes sense...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaAgreed
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitabest comment.. ever
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitadang this looks great
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaLooks like another thriller coming to theatres mmm
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaInsideous was not creepy at all :P
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaReading the Comments because the trailer is to Scary...
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaWow, this trailer gave me chills...up until the end with the kids in makeup.lol
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaIntense. I&#39;m gonna take a fine lady to see this with me so she gets all up in my biz at the scary parts.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaNINTH ! jk :D
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaReminds me of the woman in black. 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaSame old movie, different cast.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaI have the same Language Arts teacher as Ethan Hawke. 
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaTHIRD!

_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaLook&#39;s interesting. Hopefully it&#39;s not shitty.
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaBad ending movie again
_kbQAJR9YWQdelimeterByIshitaCreepy.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaDrink up, Judah Ben-Hur.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaOr we can see it as Batman vs King Tut in a realistic way
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaColdplay awe üòç
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThere can be miracles...
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaFrom Ridley Scott? Who is ... oh, the director of Gladiatior. Ohhhhhh, THAT Ridley Scott. Thanks, trailer, I needed clarification.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaToo bad this film may be not be released in Middle east, just like Noah.................
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitafacebook brought me here...&lt;-----imma claim this one as my own.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitayaayy..first 1000
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaJesse, get back to work!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaGet ready for the crazy christian outrage
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitadoes anyone know the first song? :)
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaBatses.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaLooks beautiful!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaSo this is batman beggins ( verrrryyyyy earlier edition)
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks amazing.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaI am saddened that Ridley Scott, whom I admire deeply as a director, would first make a movie based on Christianity which both brothers held in disdain and second cast Christian Bale?? What the hell. We don&#39;t need any more biblical movies. I had hoped he had more scope to offer us than this :/
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitathose Egyptians and Hebrews look awfully white.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaWow, smh now they whitewash our history with this bullshit. A movie about Egypt with an all white cast <del>__</del>¬†<br><br><br><br><br>Very appalling ...¬†
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8YsulfxVI&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a>¬† Jesse Pinkman still on the run
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitanah i&#39;ll stick w/ Prince of Egypt
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaDefinitely NOT what I learned in catechism!!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThat last scene in the trailer doesn&#39;t even make sense ffs
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaso is this like a batman origins story?
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaPinkman stop selling Blue Meth to the ancient Egyptians and Jews !! Or Heisenberg will take care of business !
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitayay white people
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaWhere the strong bodybuilders and men that built the pyramids ? all i see is weaklings, I&#39;m dissapointed in this movie
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaHe shoots war movies as easy as someone shoots a birthday party..
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThere seems to be quite a twist to the storytelling in this movie, based on the trailer (eg. the props Moses uses, the arrangement of the scenes in this trailer etc.) It would be better if they just recreate this historical event in this movie as accurately as possible, and not changing anything in it (as how The Passion Of The Christ by Mel Gibson was made). They will eventually get more praise and affirmation.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThis film will be epic
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t we all just stop fighting about how this butchers a &quot;true story&quot; or not!? Let&#39;s just enjoy a good fun movie and treat it like a myth!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaWhoa!!!!....no words.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshita2nd music please which starts @ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8YsulfxVI&amp;t=1m16s">1:16</a>
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThe dark knight rises
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitawhite people, white people everywhere.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaUmmm, where are the people of color? All I saw were white people. Great actors all around, but none of them should be in this.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaGods?
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaIt all makes sense now. Bruce Wayne = Moses.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaSo, no black people in Egypt? Seems historically accurate.....
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll say one thing about the bible.. its mythos makes for decent stories.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaistediƒüiniz kadar beƒüenmeyin, ridley scott un g√∂t√ºn√ºn kƒ±lƒ±yƒ±m
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThe Mummy 4??
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitale sigh, white people have take everything, Moses wans&#39;t white
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d be much more stoked if they cast aside all the supernatural stuff and depicted the story in a realistic manner.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaChristians need to calm down, hes not supporting your bible or intentionally dishonoring it, hes just trying to make a good movie..its an adaptation of a bible story, a bible story that is itself totally historically inaccurate.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaum........................ moses was raised an egyptian and as royalty he would have NEVER had a beard. never.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaYeah! Batman libera a los cautivos xDD
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing! And thank god Riddley Scott is the director, hopefully it will be in the same style and perhaps same caliber as gladiator. Im tired of all historical films being 300 copies nowdays
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaBatman
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaSome one now the theme song of the trailer?
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaGreat trailer! I can&#39;t wait for this to hit theaters!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaPeople...please!!!¬† Have common sense and don&#39;t &quot;drink the Kool-Aid&quot; Hollywood is feeding you.¬† This film is based of the Holy Scriptures of Ridley Scott!...in you want entertainment, at least, pic a fictional story...not a twisted one that the creator wants to feed to you as truth.¬† Read (in any Bible!!!) the book of Exodus chapters 1 through chapter 15 verse 20 to get the real story!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaSTUNNING!!!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshita@<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-8YsulfxVI&amp;t=2m04s">2:04</a>&quot;Who has been telling you this?&quot; -- &quot;God.&quot; Awesome!!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThat whole parting of the sea scene looks like it&#39;s gonna be tense as hell.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThis movie is going to make a lot of white Christians happy....‚Ä™#‚Äésmh‚Ä¨
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaComplete BS! He&#39;s made a mockery out of the Egyptian people, their culture and history. This is whitewashed to the high heavens and it&#39;s disgusting.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaYeah show the whole movie in the trailer why dont you ridley
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshita1¬†word -¬†EPIC!!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaColdplay - Midnight &lt;3 \o/
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitayeah, well, ¬øwhen Bob Marley begin to sings?
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshita2014 sorta hoping to see more diverse in people in these movies... like Oscar Isaac or Michael B. Jordan... Fresh faces instead of overused actors... Should be a great film either way.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaOMG IT&#39;S COLDPLAY!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿØ ŸÅÿ¥ÿÆ
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitavisually stunning but entertaining at best probably
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a nice movie. Too bad it is about a very old and very debunked story...
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaLooks epic but I&#39;m a bit worried that it&#39;s going to end up like Noah. About 75% of the movie is good but the movie lost me when Noah became a crazy baby killer. If Moses have a bit of a dark side, I wouldn&#39;t mind. It shows that he&#39;s human. But hopefully not to the point where he&#39;s insane and wants to kill everyone. Also after the disappointing Prometheus and The Counselor, I really hope this movie is good.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaWOW, THEY SPOKE ENGLISH EVEN IN ANCIENT EGYPT!¬†
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaOh, so that&#39;s how Moses defeated The Pharaoh.... Moses was always BATMAN!!

t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaJoel Edgerton looks like strong version of Conan O&#39;brien

t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look as good as the cartoon version
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert! wait I think theres no spoiler anymore because all of us know the story of moses since we were children! admit it, we&#39;ll just watch this for the epic CGI effects and the part where moses divided the sea.
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThis is so epic,can&#39;t wait!!
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaThank You, Father God for giving my industry the means to convey your stories of truth in such grand magnitude so generations after us experience them in the form of film. God Bless, Ridley Scott and Christian Bale and everyone on that credit list. Tony would be so proud of this film! 
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaEpic
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaHoly BAT-MOSES !
t-8YsulfxVIdelimeterByIshitaWow! The trailer of White People in Africa is finally out.

tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitahey, it&#39;s 2016 and I just saw the sequal to this movie
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaKristen Stewart is fucking hot!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaI love Snow White and the Huntsman and in the next movie I would like to see Snow White&#39;s Darkside talking into Ravenna &#39;s mirror and seeing Ravenna&#39;s form talking back to her AWESOME !!!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitawhy the hell some of you hating on the actress huh  i am pretty sure none of you num skull cant do half the things she can if u could u would&#39;ve been in that movie instead of her so fuck of and stop hating on Kristen  yall is just a bunch of ass wholes
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaThere is no universe in which Kristen Stewart would ever be fairer than Charlize Theron.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaSchneewittchen... Hello brutal German fairy-tales. How I&#39;ve missed you so.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaBG score sounds familiar....umm Inception perhaps? lol
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaFUCK YEAH
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks promising, maybe Kiersten can act after all...
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@SaveTheZebra ahaha any time, man, any time ;)
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@TwihardDiscussions thanks for backing me up dude ;)
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitai dont judge movies by actors, but it does bug me that the lead female will most likely end up leading men into battle in shining armour..... that kills it
but other wise this looks awesome!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@thoserubyslippers But this Snow White isn&#39;t supposed to be innocent looking. She&#39;s supposed to turn into a battle warrior. I can&#39;t see someone so damn innocent looking doing that.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@SaveTheZebra Damn straight! Take it from my girl, Marilyn. She knows what she&#39;s talking about!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaWow, that&#39;s not the Snowwhite I remember! lol
It&#39;s gotten BETTER. I hope the show it at the IMAX.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaXD it&#39;s a mix of Eragon, Robin Hoood, and Pans Labyrinth.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a cool fantasy romp!!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitai get chhills from her voice lol

tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaOh man whats next cinderella and the skanky sisters? the&#39;ve runned out of ideas...
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaeverybody needs to stop seeing Kristen as that girl from Twilight. she has done many other films. also she is so young and has a super long career ahead of her.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita1:26 i thought he burped :3
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitai really don&#39;t even care that it&#39;s kristen stewart. the queen will be epic enough for the two of them. and i think kristen had more facial expressions in this trailer than during the whole twilight saga.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m sorry, i just can&#39;t do it, ANYBODY other than her, first they cast her as a character named Bella (&quot;beautiful&quot;) and now as Snow White? Am i crazy or do these people see her a lot better looking than she actually is? (not to mention a terrible actress) I&#39;m not gonna watch it which is a shame because it has Charlize and that Thor guy in it, i just can&#39;t bare watching the Twicrap chick on screen for 2 hours.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@SaveTheZebra 

I very much agree STZ ^_^
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@TheTOBBYshow This Snow White project initially starts out with 8 instead of the usual 7 dwarfs. They can be seen in this trailer at 1:11.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@gamert28 

I demand you to go check your eyes. The dwarfs can be seen walking behind the huntsman at around 1:10.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaI demand seven dwarves!!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshita@uzerf theres Dwarves.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaTHAT&#39;S SO COOL!.... Until you have Kristen Stewart doing what she calls acting.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaEven though it&#39;s Kristen Stewart, it still looks pretty sweet.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaDammit, no dwarves
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaOpen mind people! Open mind! If you&#39;ve seen Kristen in any of the 25 other movies she&#39;s done in her long career, you&#39;ll see she&#39;s so much more than Bella from Twilight
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to go ahead and see this with an open mind. Maybe she took some classes! Maybe she improved her acting! I&#39;m willing to see if she&#39;s better and if not...well, the graphics look good anyway. And the story.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaMovie looks great,and Charlize  and Kristen both look great.But it sucks that small minded people will right this movie off because there jealous or mad of the success Kristen has had with twilight.

Words of advice.don&#39;t judge something you haven&#39;t seen.and all the guys really... you guys are hating on a girl lmao.
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaNow this is EPIC! Aeon flux sending Thor to end the twilight series!
tCFq6gOXDqYdelimeterByIshitaNo, not Kristen Stewart.. Couldn&#39;t it have been someone else..
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaSaudi Arabian woman is the icon of Beauty and Love üá∏üá¶
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a load of tedious boring crap
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaWhat a stupid movie smdh.saudi Arabia would never treat anyone this way. Give me a break. Everyone knows where they&#39;ll be staying BEFORE flying and theres WIFI available everywhere. No one would work in some tent NOONE Hanks appears totally clueless like he lived under a rock all his life.. as to the simple &quot;customs&quot; which they are not really customs. Alcohol being illegal, everyone knows that duh. Dude cant get up in the morning really? Why does he even have a job...none of this would ever happen ever. The king would never bother with such things as im sure the Saudi country probably invented holographic shit well before US. This would be like a traveling salesman  trying to get into the Whitehouse to sell the US president a vacuum cleaner.<br>The only thing enjoyable is the taxi driver
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitadestroying yet another culture with Hollywood propaganda... don&#39;t you see it, people?
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaDo not dream again Tom H!
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaThe movie was cheap at the end. It was just pretty much a tom hanks getting freaky with a wannabe Saudi (actually a pretty crappy Indian actress).

H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaLmao again with the Camels and dessert!üòÇüòÇ<br>Obviously, the crew of this movie haven&#39;t been ever to Saudi Arabia üòÇ<br>They need to educate themselves before making bs like this
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaDave Eggers shouldn&#39;t let people make movies based on his books... they don&#39;t seem connect the same way
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaA very bad movie and does not represent Arabs and Muslims at all
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaEvery body know all things about Saudi Arabia all this movie is fake üíÖüèª search in google or youtube about Saudi and u will see don‚Äôt trust movies . Vietnam is best example about fake movie
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaWow nice trailer I&#39;m big fan of Tom hanks his movie üé• are the best
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaDan n√°useas del tufo a d√≥lares y petromierda de esta basura. Me da que te pasas toda la pel√≠cula esperando al hombre con el cintur√≥n de explosivos que nunca llega.

H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaHow sad to live in such a repressed country!
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaAnother Flop
H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitathis is one of Egger&#39;s worst book. seriously. Wondering why this is even a movie.

H0n9_8JKtkIdelimeterByIshitaThat&#39;s gonna be one strange ass film.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look silly and childish like Avengers or Antman! Looking forward to this!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaOkay, I like how they show Mr. Fantastic&#39;s skin reacting to him stretching, Human Torch and Invisible Woman are good, as they were previously. Thing is...Acceptable in his rockiness...<br><br><br>BUT PUT ON SOME PANTS, DUDE! They CAN make you some! I can tell by the censorship covers that you have some junk, so why don&#39;t you want to cover it? It&#39;s just...EW!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaRoger Corman should be doing it. He would get it right. Again.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitathis looks great and im glad its going to have more humor than i originally thought..
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI know the movie is following the Ultimate Fantastic Four route but would be cool if instead of Doom we&#39;d get Annihilus in the Negative Zone.<br><br>Leave Doom and the Eastern European &amp; gothic Latveria to the sequel.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThank goodness these haters only represent 0,000000000000000001% of the movie going public. Nobody cares what you have to say so STFU!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaAnt-Man, Star Wars, BvS, F4, Jurassic World tomorrow... so many awesome trailers lately.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI want to believe. Started.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita....no thanks. I wasn&#39;t sure about this movie and now I know I definitely don&#39;t want to see this movie at all.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI see they fixed the title card
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaMeh.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitanah
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaAs a movie, this trailer looks good. As a comic book movie, just hasn&#39;t met the expectations.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIts silly how they try to shoehorn very young actors into roles meant for much older¬† people because its good demographics. The next reboot itll be 12 year olds.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaJohnny strom Black!??! im sorry but ill wait til its pirated!<br>I wont pay a dime for a black johnny storm.<br>geeesus!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaGeneric...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIt doesn&#39;t look bad at all, but I am getting a bit fatigued at the &quot;serious superhero&quot; style we&#39;ve been getting lately. This had the exact same tone as recent DC movies.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita&quot;Pantastic Pour&quot;
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaHah where are the haters now?
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaAlright, not much storytelling again, not as epic as the first teaser (you can hardly beat the Broadchurch theme^^), but there&#39;s some cool humor in here I&#39;d say. The effects look pretty nice, I just hope they do the characters (and the story of course) well...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaOh man, this looks incredible!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitail give it chance it looks a lot more serious than the original
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaAwesome! I&#39;ve been waiting for a House of Cards/Marvel crossover forever!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI actually love this, and I hated the reboot at first &lt;3
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaHaters gonna hate but I actually thinks this looks pretty cool!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitathis doesn&#39;t look that good
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitajohn storm using his power looks like bru?, but the thing or ¬¥¬¥la mole¬¥¬¥ looks badass
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaMeh.. I like the first trailer better. Much more gritty and serious.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitawithout jessica alba??? :S
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIt looks better than old one
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaShut up and take my money!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaReall cool
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThey showed the whole movie.... thnk
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaWell this isn&#39;t actually that bad...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaYES.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaHow F*king awsome! is this week to be movie fan
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer gives me a little bit more hope in this film. But, I&#39;m still skeptical.<br><br>I was hoping the inter-dimensional thing was a backdoor into the MCU so Doom can play his rightful role in battling Thanos for the Gauntlet just like in the comics.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know why, but I think Mr Fantastic looks like MiniLadd
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait 4 this to go back to MARVEL
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitai have faith in this movue
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaDoctor (Blogger) &quot;Domashev&quot; Doom looks terrible.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaFantastic Fail
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a Chronicle 2.0, better visuals, talented cast, gritty, hopefully it&#39;s good/successful enough to kickstart a franchise.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitanow im interested
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaFANTASTIC...4
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m not sure what to think just yet. Still a little too early to call whether this is a winner or a dud.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI get goosebumps from Batman Vs Superman<br>I get goosebumps from Avengers 2.<br>This is fantastic 4 looks great but at the same time seems pretty bad like a movie without a soul, no goosebumps but the poster looks like it was ripped from Halo 3.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rRoD28-WgU&amp;t=0m04s">0:04</a> Was I the only one thinking this?<br><br>Kevin Fiege: &quot;Rupert Murdoch. We gave you six years and millions of dollars for the rights, and you give us nothing. What&#39;s different now?&quot;
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaLooks like The Amazing Spider-Man all over again.¬† Can someone remind me what happened to that series?
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaTo people that say that this trailer spoils the movie let me give you the premise which is official: &quot;THE FANTASTIC FOUR, a contemporary re-imagining of Marvel‚Äôs original and longest-running superhero team, centers on four young outsiders who teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.&quot; So no spoilers here.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s Clobbering time!!!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitagg
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t know where all of these great trailers came from, (Star Wars, Terminator, Batman v Superman), but with this trailer and the new Jurassic World trailer tomorrow, I hope this trend keeps going.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaShitty Movie
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS SO DOPE
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIm loving the effects
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaHmm...i don&#39;t like it at all and I just think I saw the whole movie.the first try was better in my opinion.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaDr Doom looks terrible, rest of it is acceptable I guess
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaOk, NOW I&#39;m interested in this movie!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaYESSSS SUE
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitai had no hope for this movie until i saw this trailer
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaMy ranking of this week&#39;s trailers<br>1. STAR WARS duh<br>2. Ant-Man<br>3. F4<br>4. BVS<br>5. Terminator (spoilers)<br>Terminator was the only one I didn&#39;t like. I can&#39;t wait to see what Jurassic World does tomorrow. 
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaTentatively excited. It could prove to be a fairly compelling popcorn sci fi flick.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer smells really bad!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaNo, back to Marvel NOW!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaDr.Doom looks really ugly...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis is an insult to the Fantastic Four comic book, if it was a funny parody it would be okay, a real shame :(
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaAm reserving judgement...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaFirst BvS, now this? Are you trying to kill me? AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI like everything other than what they&#39;ve done with Dr. Doom (his look and the back-story). ¬†Which is kind of a big deal.<br><br>I&#39;ll see it, but... /sigh
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaToo many trailers in one week. My nerd senses are overloading right now 
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitathis looks sooo siiiiick
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaNovo trailer ?
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rRoD28-WgU&amp;t=1m48s">1:48</a>¬†Plane in the radius
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaHulk replica
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaCool
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIt would be cool if at the end the thing would had said &quot;its Clobberin time&quot;
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIf I&#39;m not mistaken, this plot is from the ultimate universe? Right? 
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaSo people are saying that this doesn&#39;t look good LMAO!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaBANTER
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaam i the only one that thinks there was WAY too much artistic freedom given to this movie?.. we may have the next Amazing Spiderman 2 on our hands. I certainly hope not
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaFantastic 4 is üî•
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaWhere is the trailer The Scorch Trials? :&#39;(:&#39;( 
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitalooks as lame as many feared. ¬†Can&#39;t wait to see Doom blogging!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks badass.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaI love the AntMan trailer<br>I love the BvS teaser<br>I love the Star Wars teaser<br>I <b>love love love</b> this trailer!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIs this still the same &quot;dark and gritty&quot; movie you saw from the teaser? People never learn...
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitapulento
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaLooks great, can&#39;t wait 
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaIt rewards my faith in this film.
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita<b>yawn</b>
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaGood stuff! Stay mad MS fanboys!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshita142
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaSo dark and noir. It would be really fantastic!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaEverybody that used to make fun of this movie will eat their words when it&#39;ll come out.. JUST WATCH
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaprimeiro do Brasil
_rRoD28-WgUdelimeterByIshitaprimer comenterio!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks good.  Kinda of formulaic for Jodie Foster but I want to see how she handles it.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThanks to this 2 minute trailer exposing the entire movie, I just saved $10.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitai have not seen that tristar logo in a long time..
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be such a stupid movie.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=0m04s">0:04</a> the Money Monster is Illuminati in background
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJack O&#39;Connell is really making a name for himself.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaIf he was not white he be dead in 20 mins into the movie
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaALLAHU AKBAR MY BROTHER
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitathis is a copy  of the TERROR LIVE  nothing New. ....
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaFeels like I know the entire movie now üòë
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitalmao propaganda.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaAgain, another trailer, another movie spoiled...and again I just saw the whole movie
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitastop showing me too much of the plot, in Batman v Superman we saw them team up against Doomsday, didn&#39;t need to show Clooney outside
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCan hear some of O&#39; Connells English accent.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitacongrats cookie on another big role!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCramer&#39;s gonna sue.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThis gave away wayyyyy too much
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaIs Jim Cramer happy or worried this movie is made?
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWho the fuck makes these trailers.  You just gave away the damn ending.  Are you nuts?
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThe first 8 seconds would have been a great trailer this spoils everything
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaIt clearly shows scene with george clooney without the vest, so i assume he doesnt die
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLOL. These same Hollywood stars have investments with these same money mongers. Hell, the movie was probably sponsored by the money mongers.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitawho is the pupet who is the master in the game of money
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWow .. sound like based on true story
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaMy god. This looked like a movie i would have wanted to watch, but because of this trailer i don&#39;t have to go anymore, since i have already seen the entire movie. What an incredibly moronic way to spoil a movie :(
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaSo sick of trailers giving away the whole movie. Fuck.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitalooks like it&#39;s going to be a hot movie!!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita„Öã„Öã„Öã„ÖãÎØ∏Íµ≠ ÏßÑÌñâÏûê Ïù∏ÏßàÎ°ú Î∂ôÏû°ÌòÄ „Öã„ÖãÏôÄ Ïù¥ÏòÅÌôîÏóê ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥Í∞Ä!!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita&quot;trailer ruined everything&quot; nah i think its fine, it looks like there is more to the movie than just the hostage but instead would dig deep into the human mind and looks like clooney&#39;s character is gonna go through a dramatic change. I think trailer is find, its just showing that its not a hostage movie but a psychological movie with a hostage theme. movie looks promising
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaGo back to making Beaver movies Jodie Foster, you absolute hack of a director
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCOOK IS BACK!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like a rare movie in this day and age, one with a story rather than crash bang explosion every scene.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaMessage to Hollywood: If you want my money, you have to show LESS in trailers. It&#39;s almost like you don&#39;t want to get paid. Your loss.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m Cook!!!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI just came to this trailer after the trailer for The Witch. The makers of this movie can learn a thing or two about cutting trailers from that one
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s here because of Caitriona?
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaAlrighty then, even Sony is pissed with Wall Street.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaone little scene would have sufficed... they didn&#39;t have to include every aspect of the film..
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaEvery thing has everything to do with everything.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaA liberal terrorist influence by Bernie sanders
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason I want to see this is because of Jack O&#39;Connell
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitagoogle the name of the guy who wrote NETWORK ... and look at the name of Julia Roberts Character.  if you have seen Network.  I dont think its a coincidence
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJack&#39;s American accent has got better since Unbroken! Looks good!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThey gave away the entire f&#39;n movie.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaPreviously on 24...
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like it might be good.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaSeems like jack has adopted a bit of tom hardy here from warrior.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJack, my baby Jack!!!!!!!!! I&#39;m so proud of him. So, so excited for this. &lt;3
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaHey, thanks for showing how the movie ends in the trailer, saving me the trouble having to see this in the theater!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaso who came up with this movie idea? bernie sanders? what a joke
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWell, I don&#39;t need to see this movie now. Thanks, whoever directed this trailer.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCame here for Caitriona Balfe :) shame they show so little of her part in the trailer.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWhy did you change the Tristar logo?!!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI just saw the whole movie. Will wait for it to come on netflix now.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitathis looks good !!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaMay this never happen in Real Life...!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJodie Foster&#39;s Direction Looks Good
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWho else spotted Gus? I knew he didn&#39;t die in that hospital!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=1m32s">1:32</a> Noah!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=0m07s">0:07</a> Interesting, they&#39;ve changed the Tri-Star logo....again.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a> Did the news reporter really just duck away from a gun blast that she would neither have seen or been anywhere near?<br><br>This movie just looks...meh.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI think it looks good, but you showed too much.<br><br>And, now it looks predictable.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita2 of my fav people ever
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJake O&#39;Connell and Caitriona Balfe. Damn, and I thought I&#39;d be seeing this for Clooney!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI am laughing at the individuals with such comments as¬†&quot;I saw the whole movie from the trailer&quot;....well, news flash people...that&#39;s what they want you to think and the sad part is you aren&#39;t even aware of it.<br><br>Anyway, with George Clooney in the movie...a great performance is to be expected.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaStill waiting for captain america movie.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI know it&#39;s a Bruce Springsteen song, but at exactly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> it sounds exactly from another trailer or movie...
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaSo this is the new trend in Hollywood. Movies about the greed of banks and corporations made by corporations to keep people believing that something is changing in the world? I guess rebelion sells.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=2m08s">2:08</a> The End.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck stop SHOWING THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN THE FUCKING TRAILER
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really good. Good for Jodie Foster getting some great material to work with.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitawhat is the title of the song that start in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a>
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaDamn.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJulia and George Clooney!!! together again!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJACK O&#39;CONNELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaA Bruce Springsteen song on any trailer: EPIC!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWow way to spoil the movie u idiots.  Less is more in trailers
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait and with this movie we probably supporting terrorism
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitawhats the song
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good, and it makes me wonder how it could possibly come out.  Either a.) the powers that be are trying to scapegoat Wallstreet all the sudden, when before they were their whores, or the &quot;market&quot; was theirs.. possibly they have taken all they can and are now burning the building to destroy the evidence?  OR b.) this is all a ruse and just a way to shape the coming &quot;fun&quot; that will be had once the market totally crashes.. which plugs into &quot;a.)&quot;.. or and it is an extreme &quot;OR&quot; that someone was able to produce this, bring up real questions that have plagued America for a long time.  I don&#39;t believe that for a minute, so I think that this is to further demonize firearms owners, and to turn on Wallstreet now that &quot;the powers that be&quot; have sucked all the wealth they can from the American people.<br><br>Either way I want to see this movie.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaOOOOOoooo, it&#39;s like watching criminal minds but with movie stars lol
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaCalling it right now. The bomb is play dough or silly putty.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitawhat song is that
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaSPOILERSS!!!! Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Chaedle put together a plot to save them.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJodie Foster going strong
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaAnother second honeymoon ruined...
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaI can already envisage the entire movie from start to finish after that trailer.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWho&#39;s the actress with black hair?
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks great.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaÌù†..&quot;ÎØ∏Íµ≠ Î∞©ÏÜ° ÏßÑÌñâÏûê Ïù∏ÏßàÎ°ú Î∂ôÏû°ÌòÄ&quot;ÎùºÎäî ÏûêÎßâÏùÑ Í∂ÅÏÑúÏ≤¥Î°ú ÌñàÏúºÎ©¥<br>Ï¢ÄÎçî ÏßÑÏßÄÌñàÏùÑÌÖêÎç∞... „Öã„Öã
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks like the film John Q except about the financial industry instead of the medical.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaF..k spoilers!!! Is there no one in Hollywood who can do a trailer without count the whole plot?!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaJust spoiled the whole movie. Thanks!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks really interesting!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitalooks good...
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaThat music is annoying xD
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaTrailer without spoilers! Love that!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitathis looks awesome
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaLooks good!
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaHi daddy, the sexy thing is that angelina hates my guts and i don&#39;t care and l don&#39;t think that angelina doesnt give a shite about any thing but this being over.
qr_nGAbFkmkdelimeterByIshitaWhat to happen to Tess and Danny?
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitawow looks stale as fuck.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaI saw an advance of this movie with a friend who is in &quot;the business&quot;. ¬†It is going straight to DVD because it is a steaming pile of horse poop. ¬†The politics are wrong, the dialogue &amp; acting is horrible, and the humor is lame. ¬†It adds up to a waste of the ticket price and almost two hours of your life.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitapretty sure its a direct copy of a bollywood movie ...ladies vs rickybahel....<br>cast: anushka sharma, ranveer..pareeniti chopra
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitai wanna see this
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaLooks good but it&#39;s just John Tucker Must Die but with adults....
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitayuck<br>and the only reason i came here was the bikini girl¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaso..basically its john tucker must die
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThis movie defines the quote &quot;To kill the villain you have to be the better villain&quot;¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaMuy bien pero coge m√°s m√∫sicas
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaJ
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitai love it
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me a bit of John Tucker Must Die for older women.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaLITERALLY JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaadf ¬†(put dot here) ¬† ly/hDMWZ ¬† &lt;----- ¬† [CAM VERSION HERE]
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlHMHLuJWbo&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a>, her nipple is poking through the fabric of her top
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaHave read the book, I manage not to cry , but when I&#39;m watching to this tailer , I have totally broken down.. Augustus Waters.. I miss you..
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlHMHLuJWbo&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a>-let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s the reason you all came here :P
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaJust wait til they find out about Cersei...
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaAs weird as it is, I can finally see a movie that involves friendship between women...(can this kind of friendship-between-cheated-girlfriends really exist??)
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThe song is named Black Sheep by Gin Wigmore
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaI love Gin Wigmore &lt;3 Black Sheep is perfect
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitais that kate upton?
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitalol this was funny
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaI WANT TO SEE THIS!
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaOMG, I cry !
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaOops I meant nicki minaj.....
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaOMG nicking ninja is in this Xd
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaFirst Wives Club....all....over.....again.....creativity is lacking.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaInstead of a movie where girls fight over one guy, after he cheats on both of them, the girls team up and become close friends and try to get him back. Beautiful (except I think john tucker already had this plot...)
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaHey look, Hollywood makes another movie normalizing and perpetuating sexism.¬† What a <b>massive</b> surprise...
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaGreat. Another chick flick vilifying men. Just what the world needs. ¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaYou don&#39;t even know him much I laughed during this trailer
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaKieds moove
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaKate Uptown :o gawd i love her &lt;3
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaAnyone who came here for Ms. Upton, or &quot;boobs&quot;, y&#39;all were breast fed for way too long. Sure she&#39;s got a pretty face and big breasts, but other than that her body is rather unimpressive. No hips, no butt, and virtually everything else about her is just &#39;Meh&#39;. Not saying she&#39;s a bad person, she&#39;s actually super cool and very nice. I&#39;m just saying she&#39;s incredibly overrated.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThe brother part was pretty funny.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshita# here for the boobs
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaPeople saying that this is a copy of indian movie &quot;ladies v/s ricky bahl&quot; do know that in the movie the guy wasnt married right? He had three &quot;girlfriends&quot; and kept sleeping around and the girls got another girl to fool him, they didnt do anything. ¬†And also, this is not the only hollywood movie with such a or a similar kinda storyline.¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaPoisoning a man&#39;s drink with possibly irreversible effects is funny. I bet we&#39;d all be laughing if this happened to a woman too.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaShame, Cameron Diaz looks the worse out of all of them...
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitacheese and rice those are some big bouncing boobs
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThis is like the fifth time I&#39;ve watched this.. Absolutely loved it.. Lol
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaOMG LOVE NICKIIIIIII¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaWo! Hollywood copying from Bollywood :O
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaHAHAHAHAHA!!!

BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaLooks like a copy of an Bollywood movie
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitalol this is rlly similar to a bollywood movie &quot;ladies vs ricky bahl&quot;...lol usually this happens the other way around
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaOnly gunna watch this for Kate Upton<br>
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaYou should probably put Kate Upton in earlier in the trailer if you want people to watch the whole thing¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaNIKOLAJ &lt;3
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitakate upton&#39;s assets now on movie. probably the reason why you guys watched the clip. lol
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThis is awesome! Hahahaha!

BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaJohn Tucker must die 2.0 ;)
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaChasing Papi?
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitathis is just an other john tucker must die movie
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaKate Upton<br>nuff said
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaDid John Tucker die?
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaugh
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty funny actually¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitathis looks horrible, but you&#39;ll probably love it if you&#39;re an insecure girl who just got dumped. it will help you gain the fake inner strength you need to move on.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaAny movie that has Minaj and Diaz in it should be avoided like the plague.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaNICKI CANT MAKE MUSIC AND SHES ACTING??????¬†
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThose. Boobs.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaThey could have just had Kate Upton running for two and a half minutes and I would still want to see it
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaNiki Minaj &amp; KAte Upton in the same movie<br>when you think Hollywood can&#39;t fall even lower
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaKate Upton on it, gotta see
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitanicki minaj &lt;3 i can&#39;t wait MAY 8 URUGUAY &lt;3
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaNice

BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaHell hath no fury like three women scorned.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaKATE UPTON !!!!
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitaA movie about dumb blondes being smart... now this is a must watch.
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitapoor jamie
BlHMHLuJWbodelimeterByIshitanot to be sexist or anything. But ive seen this scenerio in real life with people. We all know that if this ever happened those woman would be trying to kill eachother.

tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThis and Jurassic World look HORRIFIC
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaTiger Lilly you&#39;re making my singly willy. ¬†:P
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaFucking bad.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaSong name, pls.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshita160th comment
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaAnother ¬†&quot;Maleficent&quot; styled re-telling. Scratch another classic villain off the list.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaOMG CARA!!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitacan someone tell me what the songs called?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitawithout wendy is shite.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaso Hook is a good guy :o might be a prequel¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitai love it when they make movies like this and maleficent, but its not just another boring old retelling that everyone knows :) and i LOVE that they included tiger lily!!! and hook!!! :o i cant wait :D
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThe name of the 2 songs please ....
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty good
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitalooks... interesting. somehow hook is really similar to james in ouat.. looks like your average fantasy movie but nevertheless im looking forward to seeing this.  but why  didnt they cast a native girl as tiger lily? 
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWait is hook Peter Pan villain ? 
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=1m36s">1:36</a> Hey,The Joker just called.<br>He wants his accent back.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaGarrett Hedlund &lt;3
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaOrigin story version #2 (that I know of). The other version that was a 2-parter shown on Sky Movies was the other one which had Rhys Ifans as Hook, Bob Hoskins actually reprising his role as Smee :D and Keira Knightly as the voice of Tinkerbell. I bloody loved that version and still say they could&#39;ve had a full series of it covering pretty much everything that happened through the book series
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHello there fellow youtuber<br>How are you?<br>I am the 301+ viewer<br>and technically, so are you!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI know that the song in this is christina perri&#39;s i believe but what&#39;s the instrumental song. does anyone know?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWell, that looks terrible.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaIf anyone wants to know what the song at the end is ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=01m45s">01:45</a> ):¬†ReallySlowMotion - Suns And Stars¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaIs that Cara delevingne?!? <b>heart eyes</b>
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaBISHOP? Did Hugh called that guy Bishop? Man i seriously wish he call that in any X-men movies and a dude came up as Bishop.¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s it with Disney lately? :p All of a sudden all these new movies in just 2 years. But hey, you don&#39;t hear me complaining. I&#39;d say: bring it on :)
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaname song ?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitahook and pan work together? seriously?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaYohann De Sa Nogueira¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaFor those who are wondering about the <b>music here</b>:<br>Until <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=0m35s">0:35</a> it&#39;s a mix of <i>&quot;Tick Tock&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Winter Dance&quot;</i>, both by Brand X Music and from their recent &quot;Architects Series Adventure - Single Acts&quot; album. Then from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> until <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> it&#39;s a custom mix by The Hit House of Christina Perri&#39;s <i>&quot;I Believe&quot;</i> and from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> until the end it&#39;s a custom mix of <i>&quot;Suns and Stars&quot;</i> by Cesc Vila (Really Slow Motion, album &quot;Elevation&quot;).
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshita¬†Se ve muy genial¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaRooney Mara doesn&#39;t remotely look like a Native American. I didn&#39;t like the Depp casting for The Lone Ranger but at least he looked the part. Are there no Native American actresses?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaBlackbeard?! Why is he in Peter Pan? Did i miss something?!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaGod that song made this trailer 100x more emotional. What is it!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaOooo yeaaaa Hugh Jackman rules
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjW1mKwNUSo&amp;t=2m01s">2:01</a> : Cara Delevingne ? Seriously ?¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaOh My Peter!!!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaRooney Mara as Tiger Lily, no, just no.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI hate this idea a prequel¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI need to watch this movie. I care about this story. Will this movie present how this little boy became Peter Pan? I like this story.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI always love Peter Pan
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWhat a weird trailer for a movie about bread.¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaOkay, Okay...but where is Rufio???!!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s Cara Delevigne too?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;ll never be as good as Hook but it looks quite good nonetheless.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to see it! :D
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe they managed to make the Peter Pan story even more gay!!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaall these plot twists to fairytales like Maleficent (sleeping beauty) now Peter Pan are really showing kids that their are two sides to a story.¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaMy gosh, It&#39;s so obvious that Jackman is wearing a wig...
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWhat is the name of the music ?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHonestly not what I&#39;ve been expecting...I hope the plot is not too cheesy..Love Peter Pan and Hugh Jackman is a huge plus but the indians just look, i dunno a bit TOO colourful? Well, it&#39;s a kids movie...
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitawhy the hell did they reveal Jackman wasn&#39;t hook. How cool would it have been to learn the guy he was teaming up with the whole time was Captain Hook!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHugh Jackman is a fething chameleon...he looks so good here. Will watch the movie just to see his performance.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaTHAT&#39;S WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT! Much better than I expected!!!<br>I honestly hope it won&#39;t be boring as most of Joe Wright&#39;s movies are.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaTiger Lily is white now?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaMeh.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m confused, I thought Hook was the bad villain in Peter Pan? Now he&#39;s good!?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshita&quot;Experience the untold story&quot; Why ? The original one is pretty cool, just make a good movie with it instead of making &quot;Origins&quot;¬† &quot;Untold&quot; and this kinda movie...
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaNot everything needs an origin story.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThis is amazing ! I&#39;m so fan of Garrett Heldund, I can&#39;t wait for see him played young Hook !<br><br>Just, someone can tell me what&#39;s the instrumental music ? No the song, but just music please ;)
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaat least they have a good crew, unlike some other retreadings of classic stories... yeah, i&#39;m talking about Maleficent and Dracula Untold
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t believe in bed time stories !!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWell, that was pretty underwhelming.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitafantastic how all I see is white people when it was originally said they were gonna have a diverse cast. Bravo WB üëè<br><br>whitewashed movie
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWhere is the &quot;tick tock crocodile&quot;?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaCirque du soleil ?!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaContinuing the trend of villain apologetics I see. Watch, next we&#39;ll see Disney release a retelling of 101 Dalmations, where Cruella Deville is recast as the hero...
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHhehehehey  
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaIm gonna ride the tiger......lily .
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitapeta
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaGoing back to the very beginning. I see a trilogy coming
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaUh, first?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitacan someone tell us whats the trailer music please?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m gonna give this a chance  but I&#39;m just saying it looks like a terrible version of Peter Pan, I loved the 2003 Live-Action version Peter Pan film and I loved Hook.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t think you guys are getting this this isn&#39;t another of the peter pan we know its before explaining what happened before the magical peter pan
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaId have loved this to be released at christmas
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitalooks okay but how many times must we retell the same story? geez
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaFinally a trailer for a childrens movie that does not give away the entire plot of the movie. Also +1 for Cara Delevingne playing a mermaid.¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaDestrozando una historia perfecta ?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaplease release that batman v superman comic con teaser please just do it wb
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThis looks so good!!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Pan">#Pan</a> ¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitame gustan las historias que te cuentan c√≥mo empez√≥ todo... se ve buena
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitawhy ?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaThis is kind of getting overshadowed by the Jurassic World trailer...
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaBlackbeard: &quot;Have you come to kill me?&quot;<br>Peter: &quot;I don&#39;t believe in bedtime stories&quot;.<br>Me: &quot;...Huh? That makes no sense.&quot;
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHow hard is it to leave the animation peter pan alone? Not every damn animation film has to remade into a live action film. <b>sighs</b> Holywood never learns I guess huh
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitameh... maybe my 8 year old little brother will like this
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitawhat???
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaBeautiful music
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI am so excited for this story!! :)
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaDoesn&#39;t look very good
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaPAN-<b>DESAL</b>!!!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaI never heard of this film before, but I am very excited!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaReally awesomeeeeeeeee¬†
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaSurprisingly, this actually looks REALLY good. Colour me impressed!
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaHugh Jackman would have been great as Hook, but Blackbeard is fine to. Garrett is amazing and underrated
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaLooks good, but do we really need another Peter Pan movie?
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWell, second I guess
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaWarner? I would have expect Disney to make a Pan movie.
tjW1mKwNUSodelimeterByIshitaFirst<br>

MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaHoly Shit!<br>She looks great but I always thought she go crazy not the boy
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaWell, this looks like something which escaped showing in the evening on the Lifetime channel. What a pile of laughable crap. It‚Äôs like Nicholas Sparks watched Fatal Attraction on a loop and thought that he could attempt to replicate it to better success. You&#39;ve got to love though how the director tried to shove in some car chase scenes, especially touting it as the guy who directed the first Fast and the Furious film, to try and win over the poor guys who‚Äôll inevitably end up being dragged to this because ‚Äúooh! Pretty people in expensive clothes doing scary things‚Äù.
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaIt looks good, definetely gonna watch this when it comes out :)
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaomg i want to see this movie now.. .. cant wait..

MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaJeniifer Lopez is the queen of beuaty ¬†!!
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaSeems pretty good, love JLo doing those kind of movies.

MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaI can wait to see it
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait!!! ‚ô•
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshita
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaDoes anybody know the name of the song in the trailer ??
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaWow, I was expecting it to be rom-com style. This looks very intriguing despite looking predictable at the same time... I would go to the cinema to watch this one.
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be epic! Can&#39;t wait :))

MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshita&#39;Fear&#39; meets JLO
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaSO excited for this movie to come out omg
MgbBwovOOocdelimeterByIshitaLike a movie of my life, &quot;with the roles reversed
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThe only reason this movie is cool is because of Robert De Niro.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitai feel like the plot is going to be something along the lines of where the senior intern is actually the father of the ceo and wants to reprimand everything with his long lost daughter. haha just an idea
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis is going to be one of those movies that not only i&#39;ll learn something from but also make me happy afterwards.<br><br>I&#39;m sold.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU3Xban0Y6A&amp;t=2m15s">2:15</a> ¬†When she said &quot;how in one generation have men gone from guys like jack nicholson and harrison ford &quot; i was expecting her to add de niro, yeah that would&#39;ve been strange, tell me i&#39;m not the only one who found that scene a little peculiar. hahahaha
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaMake some gangster movies...real proper ones.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI feel like I just watched the whole movie. Well then, next!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaand tony nominated Andrew Rannells
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaFinally a movie that gives a big fuck you to the millennials.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI saw this yesterday and my first thought was OMG I so got to go to see this.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU3Xban0Y6A&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a> GROUPLOVEEE
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI know this is kinda random buuuuut I&#39;m really feelin a princess diaries 3 right now. Haha  ‚ù§Ô∏è Anne Hathaway! 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU3Xban0Y6A&amp;t=1m19s">1:19</a> - &quot;Better late than never&quot;<br><br>Said noone ever! :D
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaLove it, going to watch.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWow. I want to see it. Nice couples movie.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaOh puh-lease. Hollywood movies painting it like as if the fashion industries would care or be kind to people with wrinkles and paunches. Really?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaHorrible. Poor RdN.<br>Everyone involved in this production should cut themselves.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat happened to proper De Niro. No one who will watch this film will have seen Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Casino etc. And know what this person is capable of, he needs to work with Scorsese and be in a <b>good</b> film again.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaA sweet movie with ZERO romantic tension!  Yesssssssssssszzzszzdszszszs
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaLet me take a wild guess, De Niro is actually the main investor and he wanted a hands on experience to check out the CEO and train her.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaGoogles changed
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m SOOOO excited ^_^ &lt;3 &lt;3
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaLooks good but why is it I can&#39;t stand Anne?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitathis looks pretty good!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaIs that a Grouplove song I hear?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer remind me of I watching a movie from 2006 era.<br><br>Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway got great chemistry like Father and daughter-type relationship<br><br>This is first Nancy Meyers movie that doesn&#39;t involved Romance! Since our main character is old man who decides to become intern.<br><br>I hope this could be a great movie for Robert De Niro since Silver Linings Playbook which is considered to be Robert De Niro&#39;s comeback movie
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI like it when that guy use to be Robert De Niro.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAndrew Rannells! 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaOk, first off, does anybody see the Devil Wears Prada irony in this? Also, I still don&#39;t see the point in the senior intern. Is he just there to enjoy his retirement or is he actually pursuing a career?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshita&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Robert Deniro and I just farted.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWait is that Andrew Rannells from BOM? Oh heck yeah!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaIS THAT A-ARON????
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer just made me want to throw up in my mouth and spit the vomit in my mouth at my phone. I really dislike Anne Hathaway now like really dislike her, bordering on hate. Shame on you Youtube for making me be aware of this trailer and giving it a chance but to be utterly disappointed by how shit this piece of shit film looks from the 2 min trailer I have just seen of this piece of shit film starring Anne it came true Hathaway fucking artard.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAnne Hathaway ‚ù§
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis actually looks good! When I heard about this movie some time ago I thought it would be just another dramedy.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaits not common to watch robert de niro like this, but worth i guess...
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaso true in just one generation schlubs
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like a waste of money
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitadoesn&#39;t robert de niro look like robin williams when he smiles?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWorkaholics!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWorkaholics and DeNiro? SOLD!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWhy do men of my generation resist the desire to be like Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford? Because women those days knew how to appreciate a man with class that didn&#39;t have the most money, fame or best looks on their side. Being a gentleman is seen as &quot;too nice&quot; these days. Where are the Grace Kellys and Ingrid Bergmans of today?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI don&#39;t like the new direction that Workaholics is taking...
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAllright... Is he John Fransis Daley???¬†This guy , the first few seconds of the trailer...:D I can&#39;t wait, looks like so funny. :)
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaNice work A-A-RON!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitawhat the fuck is this chick-flick bullshit
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAnne Hathaway became the Devil who wears Prada... :p you either die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself as the villain? 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThat is the question. Jow in one generation did kids get like that. Ha ha
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaFor unknown reason Robert remind me of Robin Williams. Anyway Robin W can also be a good choice for the role.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAwww, this looks so cute!! I can&#39;t wait to see it.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI think the song at the end is Grouplove &quot;Ways to Go&quot;
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaNO PUEDO ESPERAR!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaIt was originally meant to star Al Pacino and the title was &quot;The Devil&#39;s Advocate Wears Prada.&quot;
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitathis man was in raging bull and taxi driver
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaLove DeNiro. Should be good movie. 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAaaand another whack De Niro movie.¬†<br>De Niro doesn&#39;t star in a great movie since Jacky Brown...<br>I think he should retire like Jack Nicholson did.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaI feel bad for De Niro. He&#39;s better than shitty rom coms. This looks not that great.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know what the song at the end is?
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks so freakin adorable. It makes you smile, like seeing your grandparents laugh happily. But I&#39;m already crying over what the &quot;sad part&quot; in the movie might be T~T
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaAmazing!

ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitanice one! they got good chemistry! 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer sold me on this film. Really looking forward to it. 
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaThis looks really cute -- and in an era and industry where youth and &quot;new&quot; seems to be over-valued, a nice reminder that not every old person is an old fogey.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitawhat&#39;s the title of the song playing towards the end? loved it =)
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaCan&#39;t wait to actually watch DeNiro and Hathaway TOGETHER!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaDe Niro and Anne Hathaway in one movie? Count me in.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitanow this is a friendship movie. this trailer put smile on my face already.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaANDREW RANNELLS!
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaDamn good for kendrick, but they are really dragging down the meaning of that song. Anyways Anne Hathaway looks fine again and my boy bob looks to be acting again. Looking forward to him in this and Joy.
ZU3Xban0Y6AdelimeterByIshitaWhat the hell are you doing Robert De Niro? Yes I&#39;m talkin to you!

bQ7BZTMLImAdelimeterByIshitaDe dakka marathi versions
bQ7BZTMLImAdelimeterByIshitaI was eight(2006) when this came out in theaters. I will never forget the first day I seen this in theaters.<br><br>My Mom and My Dad were at their business after hours with my brother and I. They got into an argument and they didn‚Äôt talk to each other for a long time(that was fairly normal), but we agreed prior that we would go to the movies which we did often when I was a kid. My Mom wasn‚Äôt feeling like going, but my Dad thought it would do us good to go. So we did.<br><br>We four seen this movie together and we laughed throughout the entire movie, but whenever the movie was over, my Mom and my Dad walked out holding hands and my brother and I were attacked to the hip. We had a front row seat to seeing them be happy again. We went home as a family unit afterward.<br><br>My parents separated three years later, but I never forgot that pure moment in time: the movie was perfect and just what we all needed. A true comedy, but also a true family story. It made my family go back to being a true family that day.<br><br>No matter what became of the family in the future, we had that day and it was because of this film that the day ended up being the perfect day.<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>This movie remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaMy most anticipated movie right now.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks refreshing compared to other Dracula stories.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI have to stare at Rickon&#39;s dumb ass fuckin face for this movie! Lmao looks awesome and Charles Dance looks like he kills it as a vamp but I really hate that kid actor hahah
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHey, can trailer editors stop using this damn song please? Must be the fourth time this month I&#39;ve seen it in a trailer.. how about some originality dammit.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m going to watch this :)
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaNo more Dracula or Vampire films.¬† Stop making them.¬† Please.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaLooks ok, but I was hoping for a remake of the original Dracula (1931) I guess later on Hollywood?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit. Tywin is a white walker.¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitalooks really good!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThe coolest scene and the complete story all wrapped up in an abridged version. Thanks, now I don&#39;t have to see the movie.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaVan Helsing will allways be my favorite.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaTepes was the man , he challenged his uncle at trial by battle after he lost his throne , Radu cel Frumos was also a badass , people don&#39;t understand that Tepes was known for his skills in battle / planning and courage not just the allegations by the turks that he was a demon / drac.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSo, taht&#39;s what happened to Tywin Lannister.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaDracula is accually a bad person in real life if this movie is about real Vlad. there are many things wrong about it.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaso that&#39;s where Rickon went xD
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaGABRIEL BELMONT!!! :D<br><br>XD
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThis looks like shit.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaWas that rikon stark?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitahollywood is like a groundhog day.... and the irony is they even rebootet that 4 times in other genres
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHollywood...
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSupernatural meets batman?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;d prefer a historically accurate movie about Vlad the Impaler, but that would be too educational and fucking epic
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitadid this start out as¬†castlevania movie but rename/change¬†into dracula...?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThe North remembers!!!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaLooks like this is gonna remind people what real vampires are like
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitacoolest trailer ever. So much hype right now!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitait will suck...you can tell just from the dialog and production values in the trailer...also why reuse the song from the AC trailer?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThe title sucks now bark doggy bark! if anyone has a problem with that I&#39;ll say go fuck yourself. 
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitalol, All of yall can go to hell. I think this movie is going to be dope, really looking forward to it.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaCastlevania 2: Lord of Shadows The Movie
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaLooks Awesome!!! Can&#39;t Wait!!!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHm....This is how I reacted to the trailer, in this very order.<br><br>1. One of the few (if any) non-comedy films with Dracula being a tragic hero type of protagonist? I dig it.<br>2. One of the few that tell of his origins rather than a story of him getting resurrected in the present-day/future or rather than another retelling of the original novel? I dig it more.¬†<br>3. One that may portray him as Vlad Tepes, The Impaler whom he is likely based off of rather than as something random like Judas Iscariot or some Sumerian demon? Digging it further.<br>4. Dominic Cooper? The digging increases.<br>5. Luke Evans? Digging so hard right now.<br>6. No sparkling? The digging has not ceased.<br>7. That scene at the end with the bats? Sold.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaMaking Dracula a good guy huh? He was the most brutal killer in history, it still looks like an interesting movie though
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshita<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2aWqecTTuE&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a>¬†<br><br>Lord Stoneheart?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaKain not Jain wtf
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaLooks sick I just wish someone would make a movie about the legacy of Jain series and soul reaver
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitawould this be better than Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula but to me looks good with the special effects and the story someone turns Dracula into a vampire i thought in the story he made a deal with the devil to become a vampire¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaIt would have been more appropriate to name it &quot;Dracula: First Blood&quot; lol
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaWell.... it looks way cooler than twilight
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaMeh, when you think about it- AT LEAST it&#39;s not like Twilight with the sparkling and the &quot;sexy vampire&quot; stuff. Who knows, they might explain the historical accuracies as for the¬†people who made this¬†ARE professionals.<br><br>I liked how they captured the demonic side of Vampires, instead of trying to make them sexy, vampires in general are meant to be fowl, demonic creatures. Sure, maybe some sensuality was shown, but overall I thought they were accurate with the following things:<br><br>1. Dracula was a real guy, no arguing about that obviously<br><br>2. Dracula&#39;s superior power to other vampires, making him different from any other vampire<br><br>3. The dark, gritty, hellish side of vampires in general, instead of that sexy bullshit. <del>pardon my language</del><br><br>4. I love how they portrayed his backstory, I mean a good man who would do anything to protect his family but eventually become an evil legend. Better than modern day vampiric sexuality<br><br>5. Sure, I get we got some critics out there who think this is some ridiculous trash covered with special effects, but who knows- it might do well.<br><br>6. I&#39;m not judging your opinions, feel free to criticize, but we should at least give this film a chance, I for one already love it.<br><br>-it&#39;s also got that dark, Romanian, castlevania feel to it
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaDude, they used the same song as assassins creed unity!!! I love it! I can&#39;t wait to see this and play ACU!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t stop re-watching the trailer!!! This looks amazing! October is too long of a wait haha
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaBAHAHHAHAHHAHA
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI am really excited for this movie because I believe this movie will make vampires badass again
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaCatlevania?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaLooks Epic. .. cant wait.<br>anyone hating on the trailer don&#39;t know what they want in movies anymore.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitamaking vampires manly and badass again. thanks
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitawhats ¬†the ¬† name ¬†of ¬†the ¬† song ¬† ? ¬†¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitasign me up
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHoly fuck, it&#39;s Bard the Bowman. 
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaTHIS LOOKS SO BADASS
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaIt*
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaDracula a super-natural hero?? Unfucking believable, but this movie looks interesting can&#39;t wait to see iy
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaTears For Fear wants their song back Lorde. ¬†This movie looks terrible and I will definitely be seeing it!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThis is actually somewhat historically accurate.¬† The man that the vampire Dracula was based off of¬†was Vlad the Impaler--a ruler in what is now¬†Romania.¬† His name is mostly known for his ruthless and brutal oppression of his people, obviously impalement as well as other unspeakable acts of cruelty.¬† That being said, he was in fact instrumental in keeping in check the power of the Turks in Europe.¬† I&#39;d imagine the &quot;sultan&quot; that they¬†mentioned in the trailer is referring to the ruler of the Ottoman empire--whom i&#39;m assuming will be the main antagonist in the story.<br><br>At least this might shed (some sort) of light on Vlad&#39;s achievements in the wider scope of European history...
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaDRACULA UNTOLD<br><br>And in case you forgot, <b>DRACULA UNTOLD</b>
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaCastlevania?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshita¬†It Looks like its going to be good¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSo this is what Rickon has been up to on Skagos 
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHey look Rickon Stark at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2aWqecTTuE&amp;t=0m49s">0:49</a>
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshita&quot;Count&quot; me in haha get it, count like Count Dracula..... no okay¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaAgain with this song.... ~
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaWell I can&#39;t wait for tht to come out it looks awsome and now for some reason I&#39;m gonna go watch Hellsing Ultimate 
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaCastlevania...Castlevania everywheeeeere !!!!!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaA REAL vampire movie? Sweet
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHOLY SHIT that end scene with the bats. Count me in
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaHoward stark from captain america <a href="http://youtu.be/_2aWqecTTuE?t=0m37s">0:37</a> :D
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshita:) sweet......but i thought Vlad Tepes III was always evil like he use to Impale his victims.....but fuck it this is fictional too i will watch it
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitalorde is in every trailer these days ...
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitasuck this eduard
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaNo impalement is an instant disappointment.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaCastlevania 2 ... 
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSong Darude-Sandstorm
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ll see it :)
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThose poor bats at the end!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaseeing as how this is basically the plot of the star wars prequels, i&#39;m interested in seeing if one movie can pull off what a trilogy failed to do unconvincingly....
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitathen he becomes evil and kill everyone
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitabat-man ?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSick!!!!!
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitait&#39;s so on my to-see list
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaanyone know the name of the song, that was playing?
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitasecond part of the trailer looks like from 2014<br>first part was quite boring<br>hopefully it doesn&#39;t apply for whole movie
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitavlad, prince of darkness. ¬†muhahahahahahahahaha yessssssssss
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaEver wonder what would happen if the Hobbit and Game of Thrones got together? It might looks something like this.¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaThis is the most epic vampire movie trailer I&#39;ve ever seen in my whole life. I just hope the movie won&#39;t suck.¬†
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaAt least these vamps are not sparkling
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaI think we have been into ¬†&quot;superheroes&quot; genre too much..that even Dracula is turned into X-men/Avenger -like.
_2aWqecTTuEdelimeterByIshitaSong is Everybody wants to rule the world-Lorde, same as in the AC Unity trailer

zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMiles Teller being punched and then being in a car crash? Count me in!
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaman, been waiting 3 years to see this and it looks better than anticipated
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaPeople are talking about Miles Teller but i couldn&#39;t even tell that was Aaron Eckhart until the trailer mentioned it. Thats a hell of a transformation!
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaLooks very promising

zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMichael B. Jordan and Miles Teller from the shitty Fantastic 4, are in Boxing movies.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaGreat Story. I remember Vinny Paz. I&#39;m hoping this movie wins. Paz and Teller both deserve it.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitamiles teller is one of the worst actors ive ever seen
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaOh good, his neck gets better. Thought I&#39;d have to watch the movie to find out!
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaafter this movie everybody will forget creed haha
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaThe true story its based on is a great story, so let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t screw it up. Looks good from the trailer.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitai like Mike Teller
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaRIP CREED
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaThis is Oscar worthy
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMiles Teller keeps taking all the good movies.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaso it begins the fantastic four are starting a boxing career üòÇ
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI gusss Mr. Fantastic wants to get in Human Torche&#39;s game.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaGame of Thrones conquering the World. Mance Rayder in this one :D

zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaIs it just me or is miles teller sexy as hell
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshita<b>MR. FANTASTIC????</b>
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitahe&#39;s come a long way from the porno lovin friend in The Girl Next Door üòÉ
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaare you rushing or dragging?
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaHe looks looks i.e. EDDY Guerriro wow I thought it about him but it&#39;s boxing
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaWhat about the guy in the other car? Did he make an inspirational comeback, too? Don&#39;t tell me he died. That&#39;s a bummer.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI think miles teller going to get nominated for Oscar for this
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitashit idk y but I got chills man
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaDamn, Reed Richards got ripped.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaCame for miles teller.... Was not disappointed. Looking forward to this one!
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaCalling it now... The number one movie in America
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI can already tell this will be one of my favourite movies in 2016
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaWho is  watching this without their penis?
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMiles is really flexing his acting bone(s(
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI was going to complain about them spoiling the fact that he does in fact get back in the ring, but I guess it&#39;s kind of obvious... most movies like this &quot;based on a true story&quot; typically end with the hero making it to the very top once again
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshita2nd New trailer with eminent berserk the other was why him
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaThis is gonna be GREAT! Wonder if it&#39;ll top Whiplash.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaEvery trailer using Berzerk today
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMiles Teller is such a good actor
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaWhy is everyone using &quot;Berzerk&quot; on trailers?
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaEvery member of the fantastic 4 movie is going to be in a boxing movie lol
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaIs that his real voice? <br>Thats a nice voice
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitayep, his career is rescued
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaThis is said to be the Creeds rivial notice how the C is upper case and the B in Bleeds is. There both know for boxing and are different races..
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitathink this is based on vinny pazenza remember his fight with roy jones jr was great
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaThanks trailer for showing me the whole movie!
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI swear to FREAKING GOD if y&#39;all don&#39;t nominate him for this one I&#39;ll be forced to believe the Academy is retarded.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaSurprised they didn&#39;t mention Vinny Pazienza&#39;s name once through this trailer
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaWhy does he look like Eddie Guerrero
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitalooks nice.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaDo you smell that? That&#39;s the smell of Oscars
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaAaron Eckhart looks good in this.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaI thought Creed was pretty good this looks to possibly be better.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaMiles Teller needs this.
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaOkay why is the trailer 2 minutes and 30 seconds? Does it spoil the whole movie?
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaHe&#39;s better at drumming...
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitamafia 3 ?
zQ6ny-fROX8delimeterByIshitaSo someone bled for this trailer......

z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaUgh

z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaClassic
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaIt actually breaks my heart bc I always felt the movie had so much going for it. The old COTT 1980 bored the hell out of me and CGI was outdated, even back then. I thought COTT 2010 would do justice, loved the casting, the trailer did its job putting asses in seats, mine included. Unfortunately it just fell flat bc of bad storytelling
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaI never get tired of this trailer. The movie has some issues, but I really enjoy it and I still watch ocasionally
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis game will be most famous
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer actually did make me go see it.
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer is pretty bad-ass!

z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaZeus : &quot;Release The Kraken.&quot;
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaLooks amazing.
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaJust watched the movie again and it held up surprisingly well. Dialogue is a bit hokey at times, but the ensemble cast is pretty great and it&#39;s an enjoyable action movie. This trailer still kicks ass though.
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaHappy 10th!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23clashofthetitans10">#ClashOfTheTitans10</a><br><br>Shoutout to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23theused">#TheUsed</a>! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thebirdandtheworm">#TheBirdAndTheWorm</a>
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaOne of the first trailers cut like a musical
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitagod of war ac odyssey  hercules
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaWatching this teaser trailer reduced my body fat from 17% to 7%. Now I have the physique of a Titan/Greek god.
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitawhen trailers were amazing...
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis trailer was fucking awesome. <br><br>Also, where are the comments?
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaOne of those trailers that are actually better than the movie itself
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaStill one of the best teaser trailers ever made
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaAnd I never used to watch this trailer in full
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaTitans will Clash
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis movie is awesome
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaHii
z7cEL6n24d4delimeterByIshitaThis makes me want to play Actraiser 2 :D
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMoral: Whales are badass
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaEdward Kenway is that you?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThe might of Thor take on the might of the sea!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitathor
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitathis is a good trailer
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis looks fun and emotional. But I really miss those days when ocean action-scenes were shot in an actual ocean and not in some green screen studio. It just looks different.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitacount me in.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSpider-Man!!!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitagood thing i never read the novel so this trailer could spoil it for me
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this? So epic!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWhat song is this? So epic!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing. I got so many Goosebumps watching this.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m eating the¬†yummiest¬†fucking sandwich right now so¬†this trailer looks Amaaaaazing.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s gonna be a whale of a tale.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis final trailer is a bit dissappointing actually. I like all the other trailers. They were tense and terrifying. Like a journey Into hell. This one feels to uplifting. That being said. IMA SEE THE FUCK OUTTA THIS MOVIE. 
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaHelloooo, Does anyone know, the name of the soundtrack used in this magnificent trailer ?? Thaaaaanks ;D
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitapoor whale.. you dared to fight for your life, inexcusable!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWell I read the book and tbh I&#39;m not going to see the movie. I feel like they show all the action shots in the trailer.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitayou watch this trailer... and you see the entire movie.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaaquaman wont be too thrilled when he hears what have thor &amp; spiderman did to that whale
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaEdward Kenway just got real.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaummmmmmmm did anyone tell these guys that star wars come out that same day?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaIt feels like the paintings of that era in motion!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaHoly shit this looks phenomenal!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitathey show to much
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaRod Howard just made me all tingly...again!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaDid I just see the entire movie? :/
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThe score sounds eerily similar to Interstellar. Regardless, this looks fantastic.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI skip this one
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaChris Hemsworth, Tom Holland, Cillian Murphy and Ben Wishaw. This is going to be epic.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLike si t&#39;es fran√ßais !
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;ve red the book, which was very good and I guess this film doesn&#39;t have to do much with the original (and fully true) story. I hope they just added some action, but probably they cut out the brutal parts of the story so it can be more digestable for everyone. I hope I&#39;m wrong, because it would be a pity. I&#39;m still excited though. :)
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWHY trailers are always that good !!!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis looks good!! I hope it is!!  the book,i&#39;ve read for school a long time ago, and ,while you don&#39;t forget that huge book, even an avid reader such as myself is not going to remember all of it.. just the high and low points., i think i&#39;ll let my tween son watch the movie first..who am i kidding he is not going to read Moby Dick.. reading is not his thing like it is mine, and while im sad about that,he has other wonderful attributes.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis looks awesome!!

K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThor!<br><br>You are bothering me!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaafter watching this trailer I finally know why this whale has a &quot;dick&quot; in his name
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWhy they call this big fish a &quot;dick&quot;
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitawhat soundtrack is playing? is it from the movie?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis trailer makes me think about what could be in the ocean.... I mean think about it maybe there might be something as big as moby dick like a squid or octopus idk just makes me wonder (: the ocean is full of mysteries.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMan Chris is much hotter in this than Thor (just my opinion...) Hope they won&#39;t start eating each other.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaAssassins creed black flag! Awesome!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitathis will be a very good movie
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMASTERPIECE!!!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSO MUCH SPOILERS...
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39; m definitely seeing this. Ron Howard is bringing it.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWhat&#39;s the legend?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThis gonna be a great movie, nice work!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitawow
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitafht
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaGod this movie is gonna look (and probably feel) amazing!!<br>The music here is probably by Twelve Titans Music.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI hope it will be as good as the book
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI saw the book its an old classic one
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI&#39;m both excited and disappointed by this movie. Excited because I know the story of the whale ship Essex, and it will be nice to see it come to life. Disappointed because the CGI isn&#39;t fooling me, and I seriously doubt this movie will be true to the story ( like the cannibalism).  Also, it looks like Chris Hemsworth and another guy are the sole survivor of this story, when actually a few of them survived.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks Fucking Great! Can&#39;t Wait!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaI swear Hemsorth looks like Edward Kenway from AC:BF
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaFace it - no one cares about this film
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWow,This movie looks fantastic I think The Long ass wait will pay off üòÑüëçüèª
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaDoes anyone know the score music for this trailer?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThere&#39;s something about being in the middle of the ocean, in all of its vastness, that truly frightens me.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitavery nice!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSo good
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThor
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSpoiler alert. Only one guy survives. You can call him Ismael.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshita<i>Wow!</i> I&#39;m so ready for this.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitai hope this comes in imax.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaHope they stop it in this movie, otherwise it will be the same as many movies.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaspoiler alert
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaGOD.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMeh, I&#39;ll take The Revenant over this one.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshita<b>yawn</b> yet another iteration of Moby Dick...
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitamoby what
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaAquaman
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaAm i the only one bothered by tom hollands mole wart thing on his chin. I feel like its gonna stick out of the spiderman mask
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSaw a trailer for this months ago and saved it to my calendar. Looks fun. :)
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks really good.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLooks good im picking this over starwars.....
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaYes Edward kenway I really think they should make ac4 with Chris he looks like him and this looks good
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaLike si hablas espa√±ol
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMoby Dick seems like a better sea monster than the Kraken was in Pirates of the Caribbean.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThor, high as fuck, hunting whales and shit.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThey shoulda called the movie dick
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaMoby Dick???
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaWHITE WHALE HOLY GRAIL
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaIF thor cant beat a fish he dam sure not beating thanos.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaHope the dummies in the ship all die from being retards. Messing with something in its own house wondering why its trying to destroy u. Thats like somebody coming to your house thinking they own the place and get what they deserve. Movie looks dumb. Stick to marvel movies.
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaIs it so wrong to be rooting for the whale?
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitathis movie sucks
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitalooks amazing
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaThor vs The Ocean - Coming Soon
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitaSpider-Man and Thor in the same movie fighting a Whale... I&#39;m in!
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitanothing will ever conquer the sea, for the sea is vast and unknown to even us with our current technology. The sea will still never be conquered by man
K-H35Mpj4ukdelimeterByIshitashame this movie will get buried in the box office by star wars.

lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaSPOILER ALERT I have seen this movie. This is the ending:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Dumbledore dies.
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaThis trailer showed me too much I hate that 
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitadon&#39;t screw this movie up with a pg-13 rating please.
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaIts more look like bollywood movie ROBOT copy :P
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaworried it wont have the same¬† heart as johnny 5, but maybe a¬†more grown up view of robot/human life is what was missing from the short circuit films. We will see.:-)
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaMuch better than the first trailer! 
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaThank you, Sony, for allowing a filmmaker like Blomkamp to be able to do his thing.<br><br>I am far more excited for this than any of the dime a dozen comic book movies or remakes and reboots coming out this year.
lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaPharrell Williams : &quot;Because I&#39;m Chaaaaappppiiiiiie...&quot;.

lyy7y0QOK-0delimeterByIshitaI&#39;m looking very much forward to seeing this. Blomkamp&#39;s films are always special!

K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaIsnt that the girl from hard candy? Cause thats how I noticed who she was
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaYes it is!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaA photo, a person doing something beyond their maturity level and someone saying shananigans...
Hum, this reminds me a certain contest, heehe!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitai hated little miss sunshine so im not gonna see this :\
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitahaha I was on an episode of that show once in halifax XD
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaaccentads, the movie is about teen pregnancy. That doesn&#39;t mean it promotes teen pregnancy. That&#39;s like saying movies about Hitler promote nazism.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaIsnt she the girl from Hard Candy? She was awesome in Hard Candy!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaMicheal Ciera (sp?) is a damn beast.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitawow, the girl looks like she&#39;s 15 or something yet she&#39;s actually 20? strange.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitamy friend watched it and she said it was good for a free movie. hahaha.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitadrink your grape juice
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaalso it has the father and son from arrested development

K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitait looks so cool cant wait to see
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaLooks amazing
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitadwight!!!!!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaOMG IT&#39;S DWIGHT FROM THE OFFICE US!!! :D, gotta see it :P
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaEllen Page is beautiful and i am so excited to see this!! hope it lives up to my expectations! :o)
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitai love ellen page....great movie
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaYes there are such things as c-sections. People have them all the time.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaSounds like a good movie. She also sounds looks like Daria being pregnant.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaellen page is great. plus she&#39;s canadian. :D
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaarrested development :)
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitasaw this yesterday. amazing acting by ellen page and a really really fun movie..
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitais that a kimya dawson song around 01:09?
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitayes
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitais she Kitty Pride from x-men??
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitayep is that girl
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaBecause I was a &quot;dual-conceived twin&quot; which means I was conceived when the other fetus was developed half way already. They had to c-section my brother and leave me in for 4 more months.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaThis reminds me of my birth. My mom gave birth to me 4 months after my brother was born. I might go see this movie if they take Jennifer Garner out.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitawhat was the song that they played near the end?
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaAll the young dudes by Mott the Hoople. The orginal version is by David Bowiem but the one in this movie is by Mott the Hoople
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaoh, i wanna see this.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitathanks! I searched that it is Ian Hunter&#39;s version.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaAfter watching &quot;Hard Candy&quot; and &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, by seeing this trailer the only thing I want is to see the movie itself! With an 8.6 at IMDB, couldn&#39;t be bad, right?
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaits All The Young Dudes. Originally by David Bowie, this isn&#39;t his version so unfortunatly I wouldn&#39;t know who it&#39;s by. Sorry!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitai wanna waaatch ittt!!!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitathat looks amazing =O
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI saw this movie earlier this week, one of the best for the year.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaplease tell me the name of song which is playing from 2:05 to 2:10. THX!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaSHINANAGINZ!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaive seen this movie, it was good and funny =)
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitajuno is horror movie lol
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI normally don&#39;t like or get interested by American cinema, but this looks quite good. Doesn&#39;t look all big and glitzy. Probably watch it when it&#39;s on BBC or ITV.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitahey..it&#39;s like Jenny and Juno, the Korean movie...
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI saw it on a holiday night in Sweden when we stay up all night. The movie theatre showed 3 movies that hasn&#39;t come out on the screen yet and this was one of them (the other one was Bee Movie and some drug/maffia/cop thing with Joaquin Phoenix). But this was kinda cool, Juno&#39;s attitude makes the movie worth seeing she&#39;s really spot on :)
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaThat looks great. I&#39;ll plan to see it.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaactually looks like a pretty good movie, i love Rain Willson :D (thats his name right?)
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitalooks gd :D
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaKorean movies stinks big time
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitai&#39;ve seen this movie 100% worth seeing
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitai think the girl ellen page i think her anem is she is a really cute and pretty girl nice and sweet there just something about her that i like lol dont know what tho lol
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaWait! Jason Bateman and Michael Cera are both in this movie? A.D. reunion!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitagreat
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitathis is horrible...
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitalol
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitavery :&#39;( indeed. There&#39;s really none?
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitalooks fairly good even though it seems like one of those really quiet movies lol
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaWOW, three of the cast in this movie were in superhero films!!!!!!

Juno MacGuff/played by Ellen Page = X Men 3

Mac MacGuff/played by J.K. Simmons = Spider-Man Trilogy

Vanessa Loring/played by Jennifer Garner =  Daredevil and Elektra

^_^
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaAt least her parents are NOT bitches like most parents!!!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t wait until I can see this since its not playing in any theater near me! =(
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitathis movie looks really cutee
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaahh i want to see this!!! i love michael cera hes so cute
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitauhm uhm well s... happens so you have to deal with it? hapylli ever after enyway i am going to see it
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitammmaannnn he aint got no big dick tho
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaas bad as knocked up, whats next, &quot;I should have used a condom?&quot;
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshita&quot;think about it, the egyptians married at 11, the romans when they turned 14, 12 for the girls. this is just nature, stop labeling this as left wing, it&#39;s reality so get over it.&quot;

egyptians wtf? its 2007 not 500 bc most people lived only till thier thirties back then, today people live over 100, so what the hell are u peoples talking about? &quot; 

I knew a woman who got married and pregnant at 15, she said it was one of her biggest mistakes, I just hope this movie doesnt encourage it.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaSeen both. This one&#39;s better. It luckily never falls into the Lifetime pit, remaining snarky all the way through. Give it a chance; it may well surprise you.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshita^.^ Holy, Ellen page is an incredible actress. Has anyone seen her in &#39;Hard Candy&quot;?
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitalmfao. looks great. can&#39;t wait to see it.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI like movies which parody taboos in our society (Censorship, sexuality, etc.) This is obviously one of them.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaWay to spoil the ending, Jackass.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaDwight Schrute...
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaurgh another one of &quot;those&quot; videos like the fast food nation and stuff..
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaThe only thing they have in common is the pregnancy. The rest of the film diverges completely.

Also this one is, you know, good.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaIt¬¥s all good, my friend, it¬¥s all good. We knew that the third act was the unknown frontier. The far away horizon, the light after the tunnel, discovery, exploration, finding.
Writing is not easy. Because writing is creating. And creating is inventing what didn¬¥t exist before. It¬¥s hard work. Can¬¥t wait for us to meet.

...Up, Juno? Yeah, I¬¥ll watch it!

Jordi
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaoooh arrested development cast! ellen page! WOO!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitadamn, that chick is fine.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitawow. way to be close minded. did you detect the socialism when you saw that the film might have some meaning, or is it just your inherent bias? if &#39;children&#39; (and by children we mean late teenagers) are physically able to have sex there is no reason not to, there is a reason we are the way we are, and it&#39;s not so some ultra-con nut job like you can determine the fate of individuals who have nothing to do with you.
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaI can&#39;t believe they&#39;d make a movie like this, the parents are complete ASSHOLES....I would NEVER act like that towards my daughter...EVER...
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaits 2 bad its not gonna b in wide release till January
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitathis looks so amazing
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaThis looks great.
Cant wait to see
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitayea, but unfortunately they don&#39;t share any time onscreen....
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitahahahahah! you can&#39;t speak english!
i don&#39;t care if you are foreign hahahahhahah!
K0SKf0K3bxgdelimeterByIshitaIt&#39;s a song that David Bowie wrote and later covered - FYI
